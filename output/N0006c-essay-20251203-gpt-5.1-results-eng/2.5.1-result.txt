I. The Fundamental Meaning of Afflictions and the Three Poisons

I.1 The Three Harmful Mental States and Unwholesome Dharmas

All harmful mental states are summarized into three basic types: greed, hatred, and delusion. Greed is a covetous state of mind; hatred is a state of aversion and ill will; delusion is a foolish, ignorant state of mind. Whenever certain mental factors arise in the world, they bring disadvantage, suffering, and unease; these very three are greed, hatred, and delusion. When sensual greed arises in the world, when hatred arises in the world, and when delusion arises in the world, they together constitute the world’s fundamental unwholesome dharmas.

The content of the three poisons is further explained in detail. Associated with greed are such forms as: the “search for sensual desire,” the taint of sensual desire, sensual existence, the obstruction of greed, the stain of greed, the agitation of greed, and the craving for sensual pleasure. Forms associated with hatred are: the obstruction of hatred, the stain of hatred, and the agitation of hatred. Forms associated with delusion are expressed as the taint of ignorance, the obstruction of delusion, the stain of delusion, and the agitation of delusion. These names reveal the different levels at which the three poisons operate and the obstructive nature they possess: they are at once craving, defilement, and agitation, and they constitute taints and obstacles.

If one fails to abandon even one of sensual greed, hatred, or delusion, this will lead to a violent, wicked disposition. Such a person causes others to become angry, encounters the anger of others, and personally displays anger; thus he is called “violent and wicked.” If one has abandoned any one among the three, one will not cause others to become angry, will not encounter the anger of others, and will not display anger oneself; thus one is called “mild and gentle.” From this it is clear that the key inner factors are sensual greed, hatred, and delusion. In external interaction they manifest as causing others to be angry or encountering others’ anger, and in one’s own conduct they manifest as whether or not one displays anger, thereby giving rise to the labels “violent and wicked” or “mild and gentle” as two types of disposition.

The three poisons are not only the root of character assessment; they also directly bring harm to oneself and to others. Sensual greed gives rise to an intention to harm oneself, an intention to harm others, and an intention to harm both oneself and others; if one can eliminate sensual greed, such destructive intentions will not arise. Hatred likewise gives rise to intentions to harm oneself, to harm others, and to harm both; once hatred is cast aside, these destructive intentions no longer arise. Delusion causes the same kinds of harm, and once delusion is abandoned, the intention to harm oneself and others no longer arises. Therefore the ultimate goal of practice is repeatedly pointed out as the complete extinction of sensual greed, the complete extinction of hatred, the complete extinction of delusion—thoroughly subduing these three fundamental afflictions.

I.2 The Broad Forms of the Three Poisons and the Faults of the World

Sensual greed is explicitly pointed out as a mistaken path and as one of the three basic unwholesome dharmas of the world. When sensual greed arises in the world, it inevitably brings disadvantage and suffering; it is a mistaken path and is closely bound up with a mistaken “search for sensual desire.” Attachment to women is described as a defilement of pure cultivation. If one tightly clings to this attachment, it is like a bath without water—merely an empty show, lacking the actual function of purification. Sensual greed is again said to bring suffering; it is a mistaken path. Stinginess is also an obstacle to practice, and a mind that accords with greed and stinginess impedes the unfolding of a pure path.

Hatred, as one of the three poisons, is described as the root that poisons the mind. Anger and hatred can become the fundamental root of poison and can even lead to rebirth in bad realms. They can oppress those who do evil; they are a very heavy poison. As they accumulate in the mind, they cause one to build up even more enmity. Thus, if hatred cannot be calmed, wholesome results cannot arise; for this reason it is repeatedly pointed out as a fundamental affliction that must be cut off.

Delusion and ignorance, as the third basic harmful state of mind, form a great shadow over the world. When delusion arises in the world, it likewise leads to disadvantage, suffering, and unease. It manifests as the taint of ignorance and as various forms of the obstruction, stain, and agitation of delusion, preventing people from understanding wholesome dharmas as they truly are, not knowing what should and should not be done. When the mind is polluted, full of hatred, and habituated to an oppositional attitude, this is precisely the joint manifestation of delusion and hatred at work, and thus one cannot recognize wholesome dharmas.

I.3 True Bondage and Disturbance by Māra

The bondage of the world is pointed out as not lying in external forms, but in the mind. True bondage is the mind’s intoxication and attachment, its craving for jewelry and ornaments, and its clinging to wife and family. These inner intoxications and attachments bind people firmly; even when no obvious external fetters are seen, it is still difficult to depart from the stream of birth and death.

Moreover, the essential nature of “disturbance by Māra” is specifically explained as three manifestations: sensual greed, displeasure, and craving. When sensual greed arises, the mind inclines toward external objects and cannot find peace. Displeasure makes one filled with aversion and resistance toward present circumstances. Craving relentlessly drives consciousness to seek satisfaction without rest. These are all forms of inner disturbance, showing that “Māra” is in fact nothing but the activities of the various afflictions themselves.

II. Desire, Attachment, and Worldly Bondage

II.1 The Nature of Sensual Pleasure and the Wrong Path

Regarding the nature of sensual pleasure, there is a clear simile: sensual pleasures of the senses are as dangerous as sharp swords and blades; if one single‑mindedly pursues sensual pleasure, in the end it will lead to regret. Sensual greed is repeatedly emphasized as a mistaken path; desire brings suffering and is a wrong way, causing practitioners to stray far from true happiness. When someone, upon seeing an external object, gives rise to sensual greed, then inner displeasure and defilement follow. This predicament cannot be solved by relying on others; it can only be overcome by one’s own strength.

It is also said that sensual greed and various sensual thoughts are part of evil thoughts and wrong contemplation. Together with thoughts of hatred and harming, sensual thoughts are listed among the evil and wrong modes of thinking that should be avoided. When these thoughts grow in the mind, they become internal, resident unwholesome dharmas, making the mind base and defiled and leading it down the wrong path.

In the contrast between saṃsāra and liberation, sensual greed is clearly identified as a mistaken path, whereas faith is called a person’s companion, able to support the practitioner in walking the right path; wisdom can instruct and guide others; delight in nirvāṇa enables one to be freed from all suffering. Thus, the abandonment of sensual greed and the orientation toward nirvāṇa become the core direction for leaving the mistaken path.

II.2 Non‑attachment to Sense Objects and to Male–Female Forms

In subduing desire, there is special emphasis on subduing the desire within the mind, rather than discarding external worldly objects. Practitioners need not deny all sensory objects; instead, they should stay far from anger, abandon conceit, and not cling to name and form. It is also said that one should abandon arrogance, keep far from resentment, transcend all fetters, and not cling to name and form. All of this shows that the focus of subduing lies in mental states rather than material things.

In the concrete practice of renouncing sensuality, it is pointed out that one should “let go of discriminations regarding male and female appearance,” breaking attachment to outward looks and forms and transcending various discriminations and polarities. Furthermore, in order to completely cut off the five kinds of sensuous pleasure known through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body, one must cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path. There is also a teaching that takes the six sense‑contacts as its object of cultivation: if one can train with regard to the six contact‑bases, then even when encountering external objects the mind will not be shaken; and if one overcomes sensual greed and hatred, one can reach the far shore of birth and death.

In addition, the teaching proposes a contemplation of relatives to counteract sensual desire. For women whose age is comparable to one’s mother, elder or younger sister, or daughter, one should arouse a corresponding mental attitude, regarding them as mother, sister, or daughter. This visualization helps reduce the mind of sensual greed, transforming relations between men and women, which might otherwise stir attachment, into pure relations of kinship.

II.3 Clinging to Wealth, Relatives, and Offerings

Worldly bondage includes not only attachment between men and women, but also attachment to wealth and relatives. Craving for jewelry and ornaments, and clinging to wife and family, are all inner forms of real bondage. At the approach of death, it is especially emphasized that one should guide the sick person to relinquish attachment to parents, to relinquish attachment to wife and children, and to relinquish craving for the five sensual pleasures, so that in the last moment one will not still be pulled by these attachments.

For practitioners, how they relate to offerings they receive is also very crucial. The proper attitude is not to be greedy for, deluded by, or immersed in what one is offered, and to be able to see the faults of attachment, using the wisdom of renunciation to make use of offerings. The wrong attitude is to give rise to greed, delusion, and immersion regarding what one receives, failing to see the faults of attachment and being unable to employ the wisdom of renunciation in using such offerings.

If one can accept and use offerings with the proper mental attitude, then body and mind can be nourished and strengthened, and one will avoid various hardships that lead to decline in practice or even to death. If one uses offerings with the wrong attitude, body and mind will not gain true nourishment and strength; instead, this will invite decline in practice and even suffering up to death. Therefore practitioners should learn and apply an attitude toward offerings that is free from greed, delusion, and immersion, that sees the faults of attachment, and that uses offerings with the wisdom of renunciation.

II.4 Temporal Observation of Desire and Disenchantment with the Six Sense Faculties

In the practice of renouncing desire, there is a method that treats desire by observing its temporal phases. Desires that have arisen in the past and have already ceased should not be grasped again. For desires arising in the present, one should seek to lessen their disturbance and not allow them to grow strong in the mind. As for desires that will arise in the future, one should guard against them in advance. In the practice of mindfulness of breathing, it is also stated that with regard to past desires, one should cut off the craving for them; with regard to future desires, one should keep far from craving for them; and with regard to all internal and external phenomena, one should be skilled in subduing thoughts of opposition and obstruction.

When a well‑instructed noble disciple contemplates in this way, he becomes disenchanted with the six sense faculties, their objects, and the corresponding contacts and feelings. Specifically, he becomes disenchanted with eye, forms, eye‑consciousness, eye‑contact, and all mental states arising therefrom; disenchanted with ear, sounds, ear‑consciousness, ear‑contact, and all mental states arising therefrom; disenchanted with nose, odors, nose‑consciousness, nose‑contact, and all mental states arising therefrom; disenchanted with tongue, flavors, tongue‑consciousness, tongue‑contact, and all mental states arising therefrom; disenchanted with body, tangibles, body‑consciousness, body‑contact, and all mental states arising therefrom; and disenchanted with mind, mental objects, mind‑consciousness, mind‑contact, and all mental states arising therefrom. This comprehensive disenchantment is precisely an important foundation for the renunciation of sensual desire.

III. The Poison of Anger and Hatred and Their Subduing

III.1 The Nature, Faults, and Consequences of Anger

Anger and hatred are repeatedly described as the fundamental root of poison. If the mind stores up heavy anger and hatred, one will form ever‑greater enmity with others; such a mental state continually accumulates opposition and hatred. Anger can oppress those who do evil and can drive oneself toward painful destinies; it is even described as able to cause rebirth in bad realms.

If hatred cannot be calmed, wholesome results cannot arise; thus it is a grave obstacle in practice. It poisons not only oneself but others as well, and it destroys the fruits of many wholesome deeds. Therefore hatred is pointed out as the very root that poisons the mind and must be completely cut off.

It is further said that anger is like both poison and honey. This means that while it may in the moment bring a sense of self‑righteous satisfaction or pleasure, sweet like honey, its true nature is as dangerous as poison, bringing long‑term harm. In the long run, this mental state gives rise to sorrow and lamentation, making it hard to obtain peaceful sleep and tranquility.

III.2 Methods of Counteracting Hatred and the State of Non‑hatred

The most basic principle for counteracting hatred is that one should not cherish or cling to a mind of hatred, not allowing the mind to love or protect such anger. At the same time, one should be able to accept others’ repentance, letting go of resentment; only thus can one truly be freed from hatred and opposition. It is also said that one should stay far from anger, abandon conceit, and not cling to name and form—these are all important methods for countering hatred and its root in arrogance.

In concrete practice, anger should be cut off; only thus can one attain happiness. By eradicating anger, one obtains sound sleep; by removing anger, one is free from sorrow. The noble ones praise the practice of eliminating anger, holding that cutting off hatred brings happiness, tranquility, and freedom from regret. The practice praised by the noble ones is the cutting off of hatred; they regard this as a kind of “killing” without evil karma, because what is destroyed is the affliction itself, not the life of living beings.

Regarding the state of non‑hatred, there is also a teaching concerning the path of the heavenly beings. By contemplating and reflecting on the path of the devas, one comes to know that among the devas, non‑hatred is regarded as the supreme state. Having no hatred toward any object—whether frightening or reassuring—one thereby surely accomplishes the dharma of the heavenly path and abides in it. With respect to future good destinies, non‑hatred is seen as the highest state and the goal that should be emulated.

III.3 Anger with Fear, Peaceful Sleep, and Friendship

When the mind is long dominated by anger and fear, certain psychological states appear. It is said of such a mind: this mind is constantly afraid; this intention is constantly trembling. Whenever a thought arises, it is extremely fearful; even when one tries to keep it from arising, there is fear. Only by giving up all external attachments can one behold living beings at peace and allow one’s own mind the possibility of genuine stability.

In daily interactions and the maintenance of friendship, there are also concrete guidelines for caution. One should not let anger conquer oneself, nor should one respond to others’ anger with anger. One should not enter into the domain of anger—that is, not be shaken by others’ ridicule or criticism. Nor should one belittle others or destroy friendships. If one can bring anger to rest, one thereby produces happiness and freedom from sorrow. This state of bearing no anger and not harming others is described as a condition of dwelling together with the noble ones.

IV. Delusion, Ignorance, and Cognitive Obstruction

IV.1 Manifestations of Ignorance and Delusion

Delusion and ignorance are listed as one of the three fundamental harmful mental states, and they appear under various names such as the taint of ignorance, the obstruction of delusion, the stain of delusion, and the agitation of delusion. When the mind is polluted, filled with hatred, and habitually adopts an oppositional stance, it is incapable of recognizing wholesome dharmas. This state is precisely the result of delusion and hatred intertwining. If one wishes to understand wholesome dharmas, one must extinguish hatred and remove the mind of distrust and displeasure; otherwise, as long as the mind remains in non‑faith and opposition, it is difficult to accept correct instruction.

Furthermore, distortions in the teachings of non‑Buddhist paths are also related to delusion. There is a type of ascetic practice that emphasizes severe austerities and a life of renunciation, overly focusing on external restraints of speech and behavior and on ending disputes, and advocates the purification of life through bodily control. Such practice is biased toward the physical level and overlooks the true subduing of the fundamental afflictions—greed, hatred, and delusion. Because it fails to counter the three poisons at their root, this path is regarded as a mistaken form of ascetic practice within non‑Buddhist teachings and cannot bring about true liberation.

IV.2 Three Kinds of Searching and Grasping in Saṃsāra

Related to delusion and the afflictions are three fundamental kinds of searching. These three searches are: the search for sensual desire—that is, the pursuit of sensual pleasures; the search for existence—that is, the clinging to states of being; and the search for the holy life, elsewhere called the search for formations—that is, clinging to constructed activities and practices. These searches constitute the driving force that makes the mind constantly run about and chase after things, keeping people circling among sensual pleasure, modes of existence, and fabrications of behavior.

In a more detailed classification, there is mention of the three cravings and the three taints. The three cravings are craving for sensual pleasure, craving for existence, and craving for non‑existence. The three taints are the taint of sensual desire, the taint of existence, and the taint of ignorance. The four floods are also related: the flood of sensual desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance. And the four kinds of clinging are: clinging to sensual pleasure, clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of self. All of these, on a more refined level, point out how desire, existence, and ignorance keep surging and clinging in saṃsāra, and they must be fully understood, fully exhausted, and cut off in practice.

V. Mental States, Attention, and Similes for Training the Mind

V.1 Inferior Mental States and Five Afflictive Conditions

The quality of mental states is divided into inferior and pure. An inferior state of mind appears as a base and defiled state of volition, characterized by mutual pollution and downward tendency. Such a mind is often associated with sensual desire, hatred, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt, and is regarded as unwholesome.

These five unwholesome conditions can be explained through similes of water. When the mind is full of sensual desire, it is like turbid water mixed with various colored impurities, unable to reflect clearly. When the mind is ruled by hatred, it is like boiling, bubbling hot water, unable to remain calm and observe. When the mind is in sloth and torpor, it is like a surface of water covered by water plants, unable to clearly reveal anything. When there is much restlessness and remorse, it is like water stirred by the wind, whose surface cannot remain stable enough to reflect. When the mind is full of doubt, it is like murky water placed in a dark place, unable to shine and reveal. Conversely, when the mind is free from sensual desire, it is like clear water without impurities, able to reflect distinctly. When free from hatred, it is like still water that is not boiling, able to calmly observe. When free from sloth and torpor, it is like a bright water surface without covering, capable of clear manifestation. When free from restlessness and remorse, it is like water that is stable and unruffled, capable of reflecting things as they are. When free from doubt, it is like clarified water placed in a bright place, able to shine clearly. These similes display the difference between afflicted and purified states of mind.

V.2 Attention and the Increase or Decrease of Unwholesome States and Awakening Factors

The focus of mental attention determines the growth or elimination of corresponding mental states. If one continually attends to objects that foster unwholesome dharmas, then unarisen unwholesome dharmas will arise, and arisen unwholesome dharmas will grow and expand. These unwholesome dharmas specifically include sensual desire, hatred, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. Conversely, if one continually attends to objects that foster the factors of awakening, then unarisen awakening factors will arise, and arisen awakening factors will be cultivated to fulfillment. This principle applies universally to the cultivation and countering of all kinds of mental states and shows that the direction of attention is extremely crucial for training the mind.

In the cultivation of the seven factors of awakening, it is particularly stressed that one must start from subduing the three fundamental afflictions. The practice of the awakening factors aims at subduing and ultimately exhausting sensual desire, hatred, and delusion, leading the mind step by step toward awakening and purity.

V.3 Similes for Mental States and the Strength or Weakness of Mental Defenses

The strength or weakness of a practitioner’s mental defenses is also illustrated by concrete similes. If one’s mental defenses are firm, they are like a solid, moist clay house that no source of fire can ignite, meaning that a practitioner’s mind is not disturbed by external objects. If one’s mental defenses are weak, they are like an old, dry grass hut that can be ignited by fire coming from any direction, meaning that a practitioner is easily disturbed by external objects and that the flames of affliction flare up at the slightest touch.

In regard to subduing mental states, there is another simile using a young elephant. If a bhikṣu can cut off sensual greed—like cutting off a post, smashing a door‑bar, and removing a fence—then one who “has eyes” becomes purified and unstained; his mind is well‑subdued, like a well‑trained young elephant, which, while moving about, is not defiled by afflictions. This shows that once the mind has been subdued, it can roam freely among various circumstances without becoming defiled.

Inner afflictions are also symbolized by flames of fire. It is said: “Your conceit is called a heavy burden.” Conceit is like a heavy load pressing on one’s shoulders. Anger is like smoke rising from the inner flames. False speech is like ash that covers the remains after the fire burns. The tongue is compared to a wooden ladle, like the scoop that stirs the fire; if it acts in concert with false speech, it keeps stirring up the fire of afflictions. This sequence of similes shows how conceit, anger, and false speech together form the elements of the inner blaze of affliction.

VI. The Five Aggregates, the Three Feelings, and the Cutting Off of Latent Tendencies

VI.1 Craving for the Five Aggregates and Deep‑seated Grasping

In the practice of liberation, the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—are objects that must be thoroughly understood and from which grasping must be completely cut off. For each aggregate, one must eradicate the many afflictions connected with it, including desire, craving, delight, attachment, intimacy, clinging, the mind’s appropriation, present craving, and latent tendencies. This shows that craving for the five aggregates is not just a superficial liking and attachment, but also includes deeper levels of clinging and latent dispositions.

Therefore, one must further cut off such subtle afflictions regarding the five aggregates as clinging, mental attachment, present craving, and latent tendencies. Thoroughly cutting off craving for the five aggregates is likened to cutting off both the trunk and root of a tree so that it returns to non‑existence and will never arise in the future; like a palmyra tree whose root and crown have been cut off, making it return to non‑existence so that it will never arise again. If a bhikṣu can cut off craving for the realms of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, then because craving is cut off, the root of grasping is severed, and the mind loses the conditions for taking that aggregate as its object and support.

In the goals of liberation practice, it is especially emphasized that one must extinguish sensual greed, extinguish hatred, and extinguish delusion as the final fruit of correct knowledge of the five aggregates. Practitioners are further encouraged to cut off the clinging to self, the clinging to “what belongs to me,” to cut off pride, and to cut off the latent tendencies of afflictions. This again is to remove, at its root, the mistaken connection between the five aggregates and “I.”

VI.2 The Three Feelings and Latent Tendencies, Taints, and Craving: Their Counteraction

Feelings are divided into three types: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither‑pleasant‑nor‑painful feeling. These three types of feeling correspond to three latent afflictions: pleasant feeling can discard the latent tendency of sensual craving; painful feeling can discard the latent tendency of hatred; neither‑pleasant‑nor‑painful feeling can discard the latent tendency of ignorance. Through contemplation, if one can observe pleasant feeling and its causal contact as impermanent, one can abandon the latent craving for pleasant feeling. Likewise, by observing painful feeling and its causal contact as impermanent, one can abandon the latent hatred toward painful feeling. By observing neither‑pleasant‑nor‑painful feeling and its causal contact as impermanent, one can abandon the latent ignorance toward that neutral feeling.

In concrete practice goals, it is stated that one must abandon all grasping connected with the three types of feeling, including clinging to pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither‑pleasant‑nor‑painful feeling. At the same time, one must abandon the three taints—the taint of sensual desire, the taint of existence, and the taint of ignorance—as well as the three cravings—craving for sensual pleasure, craving for existence, and craving for non‑existence. One must also cut off the four floods—the floods of sensual desire, existence, views, and ignorance—and the four kinds of clinging—clinging to sensual pleasure, clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of self. This series of abandonments forms a comprehensive counteraction from feeling to craving, clinging, existence, and finally the floods of ignorance.

VII. The Practice of the Right Path and the Outline of Subduing Afflictions

VII.1 The Noble Eightfold Path, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Seven Awakening Factors, and the Five Powers

In the overall path of practice, it is repeatedly emphasized that the purpose of cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path is to ultimately subdue sensual greed, to ultimately subdue hatred, and to ultimately subdue delusion. To completely subdue sensual greed, hatred, and delusion, one should cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path. The primary benefit of cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path is to continuously practice in a way that naturally causes the fetters to wear away and decay; thus the bonds of afflictions are gradually weakened.

In addition, in order to cut off the three basic afflictions of desire, the affliction of existence, and the affliction of ignorance, one should cultivate the four foundations of mindfulness. The direct function of cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness is to subdue craving for the world and to subdue sorrow and worry about the world. Likewise, to completely subdue sensual greed, hatred, and delusion, one should cultivate the seven factors of awakening. The general aim of cultivating the five powers is also to thoroughly subdue sensual greed, hatred, and delusion, showing that these three poisons are the central targets of all these practices.

Elsewhere it is stated that practice is undertaken to realize, to fully know, to thoroughly exhaust, and to cut off the five higher fetters, indicating that the more subtle bonds must also be completely eliminated in sequence through the right path. Whether it is the Noble Eightfold Path, the four foundations of mindfulness, the seven factors of awakening, or the five powers, their fundamental purpose is repeatedly directed toward one point: the complete subduing of sensual greed, hatred, and delusion.

VII.2 The Practice of Mindfulness of Breathing and the Six Contact‑Bases

Among the many methods of practice, mindfulness of breathing is called the fundamental method for accomplishing many states of mind. Through mindfulness of breathing, one can cut off thoughts about worldly life; take things that are not repulsive and regard them as repulsive; take things that are repulsive and regard them as not repulsive; and then abandon and transcend both “repulsive” and “not repulsive,” abiding in calm, mindfulness, and clear comprehension. Its principle for countering desire is clearly stated: regarding past desires, one should cut off craving for those desires; regarding future desires, one should keep far from craving for those desires; regarding all internal and external phenomena, one should be skilled in subduing all thoughts of opposition and obstruction.

Furthermore, if one can train in relation to the six contact‑bases, then even when coming into contact with external objects, the mind will not be shaken. When the six sense faculties face the six kinds of objects, if they are not stirred up in this way, one can gradually overcome sensual greed and hatred and thereby reach the far shore of birth and death. This shows that the practice of mindfulness of breathing and the six contact‑bases can both subdue sensual desire and stabilize the mind, becoming the practical foundation for crossing to the other shore.

VII.3 The Ultimate Goal of the Holy Life and Delight in Nirvāṇa

The ultimate goal of the holy life is clearly defined as the extinction of sensual greed, the extinction of hatred, and the extinction of delusion. No matter which method of practice is employed, ultimately it is for the purpose of thoroughly subduing sensual greed, thoroughly subduing hatred, and thoroughly subduing delusion, so that these fundamental afflictions are completely pacified. A practitioner whose taints are exhausted has completely abandoned sensual craving, hatred, and delusion, making them like trees whose roots are severed and which never grow again—this is the manifestation of unshakable liberation of mind.

One passage states that delight in nirvāṇa can free a person from all suffering. When someone gives rise to genuine delight in nirvāṇa, he no longer takes sensual greed and worldly pleasures as his refuge, but instead takes faith and wisdom as his companions and walks the path to liberation. Faith is described as a person’s companion; wisdom can instruct others; and delight in nirvāṇa brings complete freedom from suffering.

VIII. Obstacles to Practice, Errors of Non‑Buddhist Paths, and the Faults of Negligence

VIII.1 The Errors of Non‑Buddhist Asceticism and Mere Bodily Restraint

Certain non‑Buddhist doctrines emphasize severe asceticism and a life of renunciation, placing their focus on external restraints of behavior and moderation. For example, some teachings place special importance on outward restraint of speech and behavior and on the cessation of disputes, and advocate purification of life through bodily control. However, such ascetic practice ignores the true subduing of the inner fundamental afflictions—greed, hatred, and delusion—and devotes excessive energy to forms of hardship. Because it does not counter the three poisons at their root, this path is regarded as an error among non‑Buddhist doctrines and cannot bring about true liberation.

VIII.2 Internal Habituation, Having an Inner “Mentor,” Negligence, and the Faults of a Bhikṣu

In practice, there is discussion of the fault of “having internal habitation and an internal mentor.” “Internal habitation” means that evil unwholesome dharmas dwell in the mind. “Having an inner mentor” means that these unwholesome dharmas become the rule and guide within the mind—like an internal teacher directing behavior and thought. In contrast, the merit of “no internal habitation, no internal mentor” is praised as purity. When unwholesome dharmas do not dwell in the mind, this is “no internal habitation”; when unwholesome dharmas do not serve as guiding rules in the mind, this is “no inner mentor.” Practitioners should always cultivate the holy life of no internal habitation and no inner mentor in evil; only thus can they stay far from suffering and unease and attain stability and happiness.

Negligence is also pointed out as having grave faults. One who is negligent has body and mind oppressed by afflictions and finds no peace. One’s behavior is unrestrained, following desire in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. Although, on the surface, the enjoyment of sensual pleasures may seem to bring temporary comfort and joy, this is merely an interval between sufferings and not true happiness. In this process, body and mind are in fact constantly oppressed by sensual greed and afflictions.

In daily life, a bhikṣu must also avoid certain concrete faults. Evil thoughts and wrong contemplation—such as thoughts of sensuality, hatred, and harming—are mental states that should be abandoned. In terms of behavior, improper ways include: entering villages too early, returning too late to the forest, associating too much with laypeople, indulging in much worldly gossip, craving worldly sights and sounds, and taking others’ things without permission. These actions easily give rise to attachment and mistaken reliance, weakening the purity of practice. Further, laziness and negligence manifest in oversleeping, restlessness, distraction, excessive talking, and many wandering thoughts. These habits consume mental energy from within, making it difficult for the path of purity to be firmly established.

IX. The Practitioner’s Actual Difficulties and Their Remedies

IX.1 Difficulties in Practice: Sensual Greed, Hatred, and Forgetfulness

Practitioners often encounter inner struggles when facing external objects. When, upon seeing external phenomena, one gives rise to sensual greed, the mind falls into displeasure and defilement. This predicament of desire arising from external objects cannot be resolved by relying on others but only by one’s own strength. If the mind is tainted by sensual greed, and hatred and thoughts of harm also arise, one easily loses right mindfulness and clear comprehension, and consciousness becomes scattered and unstable; this is a concrete manifestation of failure in practice.

In instructions on the path to liberation, many obstacles that should be abandoned are also indicated. Doubt is a state that should be abandoned, causing hesitancy and indecision. The eight wrong factors of the path—wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration—are deviant paths that must be abandoned, for they lead people astray from the right way. Ignorance is likened to a great forest that must be passed through, in which the road ahead is hard to see clearly. The various desires are a very large and deep swamp that one must cross, easy to sink into and difficult to escape. Anger, fury, and sorrow, meanwhile, are steep obstacles that must be surmounted, like mountain ridges blocking one’s advance.

IX.2 Concrete Practice and the Path of Abandoning Conceit

The key to subduing mental states is not to suppress them completely, but to stop them where evil thoughts arise, cutting them off at the source. A bhikṣu who maintains discipline, possesses wisdom, cultivates the mind, and is diligent and cautious can thereby be freed from all bonds.

The fundamental principles of training the mind clearly state that one should stay far from sensual love, maintain a correct mind and right mindfulness, and keep the mind from being shaken by desire and hatred.

In the practice of abandoning conceit, it is indicated that one should practice diligently, stay far from the hindrances of the mind, thoroughly purify and sweep away all conceit, and rely on wisdom to reach the complete extinction of afflictions. In this way, one can become a person in whom afflictions have become quiet and whose inner state is peaceful. When the fruits of practice mature, one can extinguish the intense fire of sensual greed so that it no longer burns repeatedly; through complete insight into arrogance, one is able to walk the path of tranquility.

As for the ultimate goal in training the mind, it is further stated that if one can train with regard to the six contact‑bases, then even when coming into contact with external objects, the mind will not be shaken; and once sensual greed and hatred are overcome, one can reach the far shore of birth and death. All of this shows that subduing sensual desire, subduing hatred, and subduing delusion is the core objective of practice.

IX.3 Dealing with Offerings, Pleasant Feeling, and Thoughts of Worldly Life

When facing pleasant feelings and worldly life, practitioners must adopt the correct attitude. The practice of mindfulness of breathing is regarded as the fundamental method for cutting off thoughts about worldly life. Through this practice, one can take things that are not repulsive and see them as repulsive; take things that are repulsive and see them as not repulsive; and ultimately abandon and transcend both “repulsive” and “not repulsive,” abiding in calm, right mindfulness, and clear comprehension, no longer pulled about by pleasant or painful feelings.

Regarding the handling of offerings, the correct and incorrect attitudes have already been mentioned above. Furthermore, in relation to sensual greed and evil unwholesome dharmas, one may choose either to go along with their arising or not to go along with their arising. If a practitioner can refrain from going along with the arising of unwholesome states and contemplates pleasant feelings and offerings with right mindfulness, then body and mind can gain genuine nourishment and strength, rather than falling into the suffering of decline in practice or even death.

X. Contemplation of Birth and Death, Overcoming Fear, and Letting Go at the Time of Death

X.1 Fearful Mental States and Letting Go of External Conditions

Regarding birth, death, and fear, there is a description of the state of mind: this mind is constantly afraid; this intention is constantly trembling; when it arises it is very fearful; even when it does not arise, it still feels afraid. If such a mind clings to all external things, it cannot attain peace. In this situation, if one can give up everything external, one can behold living beings at peace and gradually distance oneself from fear.

When facing objects that are frightening or reassuring, if one can refrain from giving rise to a mind of hatred, this corresponds to the path of the devas, who regard non‑hatred as the supreme state. In this way, one is no longer driven by fear and hatred, but can remain at ease in all situations.

X.2 Guidance in Letting Go of Attachments at the Time of Death

In the practical implementation of end‑of‑life care, it is especially indicated that one should help the sick person to cut off various attachments. Specifically, one should guide the dying person to let go of attachment to parents, to let go of attachment to wife and children, and to let go of craving for the five sensual pleasures. This guidance aims to prevent the dying person from being drawn by affection and sensual pleasures at the last moment, allowing him to face death with a mind free from hindrance and away from fear of future bad rebirths.

XI. The Virtues of the Liberated One and a Gentle State of Mind

XI.1 Cutting Off the Fundamental Afflictions and the Higher Fetters

The core characteristic of a liberated person lies in the cutting off of the fundamental afflictions. Sensual desire has been extinguished without remainder; hatred has been extinguished without remainder; and all attachment to the world has been transcended. In order to reach this state, practitioners must cultivate so as to realize, fully know, thoroughly exhaust, and cut off the five higher fetters, continually eliminating the three poisons and their latent tendencies along the way. When sensual craving, hatred, and delusion are completely abandoned, they are like trees whose roots have been severed, never to sprout again; thus the bonds of afflictions no longer exist.

In the transformation of disposition, if one has not abandoned any one among sensual greed, hatred, and delusion, one will cause others to become angry, encounter the anger of others, and display anger oneself; thus one is called “violent and wicked.” If one has abandoned any one of the three poisons, one does not cause others to become angry, does not encounter the anger of others, and does not display anger oneself; thus one is called “mild and gentle.” Such gentleness is founded upon a genuine inner freedom from greed, hatred, and delusion.

XI.2 The Virtues of the Noble Ones, the Heavenly Path of Non‑hatred, and Gentle Disposition

The concrete elements in the manifestation of virtue include freedom from anger, a gentle disposition, and skill in subduing the mind. The practice praised by the noble ones is the cutting off of hatred; they regard this as a “killing” without evil, because what is cut off is the affliction. The cessation of anger brings happiness and freedom from sorrow. Bearing no anger and not harming others is a state of dwelling together with the noble ones. Therefore, within virtue, what is most esteemed is a mind that is free from hatred, gentle, and well‑subdued.

Moreover, by contemplating and observing the path of the heavenly beings, one comes to know that among the devas, non‑hatred is the highest state. Having no hatred toward any object—whether frightening or reassuring—one thereby surely accomplishes the dharma of the heavenly path and abides in it. From ordinary beings to noble ones, from the human realm to the heavenly realms, non‑hatred, absence of anger, and gentleness are consistently regarded as the most noble virtues.

To sum up, the fundamental spirit of the entire path of practice is to subdue greed, hatred, and delusion at every level: beginning with subduing desire, staying far from anger, and removing delusion and ignorance; progressing to cutting off all grasping for the five aggregates, the three feelings, the three taints, the three cravings, the four floods, and the four kinds of clinging; and coordinating this with the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, the four foundations of mindfulness, the seven factors of awakening, the five powers, mindfulness of breathing, and the six contact‑bases. In the end, one reaches the state in which sensual greed is extinguished, hatred is extinguished, and delusion is extinguished. In this way the mind no longer lingers over sensory objects, stays far from laziness and negligence, far from sleepiness and sloth, and becomes a person in whom afflictions are quiet and the inner state is peaceful. Walking this gentle and pure path, one transcends birth and death and realizes liberation.
