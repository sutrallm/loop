I. The Central Place of Good Friends and the True Dhamma  

I.1 Basic Principles for Associating with Good People and Good Friends  
A practitioner must first understand how to choose with whom to live and associate. One should live together and associate with good people and good friends, and not keep company with bad friends, bad companions, or bad associates. Associating with good friends, good companions, and good associates is the fundamental principle of drawing near to good friends, and is also the most direct way to practice wholesome qualities. The concrete way to practice wholesome qualities is precisely to draw near to good friends and to learn the true Dhamma taught by good spiritual mentors. Drawing near to good friends is not merely an emotional dependence; it is a long‑term process of living together, interacting, and learning. Only by truly living, traveling, and cultivating together in daily life can one genuinely benefit.

In choosing good people and good friends, one must judge according to the basic standard of a good person. A truly good person is one who can extinguish greed, hatred, and delusion in the heart, and who can also speak words that accord with the Dhamma. Drawing near to such good people and good spiritual mentors, and becoming familiar with the methods they teach, is an important condition for establishing the basis of practice. Further, a practitioner should not only draw near to noble ones, become familiar with the noble ones’ teaching and cultivate it, but also draw near to good people, become familiar with the good people’s path and cultivate it. In this way, through actual practice, wholesome qualities gradually ripen within body and mind.

I.2 Good Friends and the Noble Eightfold Path, the Seven Factors of Awakening, and the Factors of Stream‑entry  
Good friends are not a secondary condition appended to the path of practice; they are the true foundation of the entire holy life. For a bhikkhu, if there is a good friend as a companion, he can be expected to practice the Noble Eightfold Path repeatedly. Relying on seclusion, relying on dispassion, relying on cessation, he cultivates right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration, thereby abandoning defilements and turning toward Nibbāna. A practitioner should also take good friends as a refuge, dedicate himself to cultivating and implementing the Noble Eightfold Path, so that this path is repeatedly fulfilled in his life without backsliding.

Before the Noble Eightfold Path arises, there are seven important preliminary conditions that must be fulfilled one by one. These seven preliminaries are: drawing near to good friends; purity of virtuous conduct; being fully endowed with zeal and aspiration; being personally well‑endowed; being well‑endowed with right view; non‑negligence (heedfulness); and wise attention. Among them, drawing near to good friends is the foremost condition, because all subsequent purity of virtue and fullness of right view are intimately related to those with whom one associates. In addition to the Eightfold Path, good friends are also the key external condition for the arising of the seven factors of awakening. Among all external conditions, the most crucial is associating with good friends. One who has good friends is able to cultivate and frequently develop the seven factors of awakening. Good friends are like the dawn before the rising of the sun; they are the harbinger of the arising of the factors of awakening. When good friends appear like the dawn, the seven factors of awakening appear like the sun, supported by firm conditions.

Moreover, associating with virtuous persons also constitutes an important basis for the path of stream‑entry. Four fundamental conditions of practice are called the factors of stream‑entry; they are at once the constituting elements of stream‑entry: drawing near to virtuous persons; listening to the true Dhamma; wise attention; and practicing in accordance with the Dhamma. Drawing near to virtuous persons is the starting point; listening to the true Dhamma is the channel for absorbing the teaching; wise attention is the correct reflection and discernment of the Dhamma in one’s own mind; and practicing in accordance with the Dhamma is putting the Dhamma into concrete action. These four are both the four basic conditions of practice and the complete content of what is called the four factors of stream‑entry. At the same time, they are concrete practical points within the methods of practice and the core pathway for the accomplishment of wisdom. When a practitioner associates with virtuous persons, listens to the true Dhamma, correctly reflects on the Dhamma, and practices in accordance with the Dhamma, he has set out on the path leading to the fruit of stream‑entry and the perfection of wisdom.

I.3 Good Friends and Liberation from Birth, Aging, Sickness, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, and Distress  
Good friends have a decisive role in liberation from birth, aging, sickness, death, and all sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress. When one relies on good friends, beings who are endowed with the condition of birth, aging, sickness, death, and the many forms of sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress can all attain liberation by means of the Dhamma they are taught. Those who possess the condition of birth can be liberated from birth; those who possess the condition of aging can be liberated from aging; those who possess the condition of death can be liberated from death; and those who possess the condition of sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress can be liberated from sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress. Because they take good spiritual mentors as their reliance, beings can be freed from the bonds of birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, anxiety, and affliction; birth, aging, sickness, death, and all sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress no longer remain inescapable fetters.

Therefore, good friends are not merely a part of the holy life; they are its complete foundation and entirety. Having good friends is the complete condition for accomplishing the pure holy life; without good friends, the pure holy life cannot be fulfilled in all respects. From all this it is evident that good friends are both the entirety of the holy life and the fundamental condition for beings to be liberated from all suffering.

I.4 Good Spiritual Mentors in Relation to Attachment to the Five Aggregates and Self‑view  
Whether or not one generates mistaken attachment to the five aggregates depends on whether one draws near to good spiritual mentors and the true Dhamma. If one can long remain close to good spiritual mentors, becoming familiar with and cultivating the true Dhamma they teach, one’s mistaken grasping of the five aggregates can gradually loosen and even be cut off. Conversely, if one is far from good spiritual mentors and the true Dhamma, one easily gives rise to inverted clinging to the five aggregates, leading to various kinds of pain and affliction. The formation and removal of self‑view (personality view) are based on the same prerequisites. When a practitioner draws near to noble ones and becomes familiar with their teaching, further cultivating the noble ones’ teaching, and at the same time draws near to good people, becomes familiar with the good people’s path and cultivates it, he thereby has a firm basis for counteracting self‑view. Thus, drawing near to noble ones and good people and becoming familiar with and cultivating their path not only concerns whether one’s view is pure; it also concerns a fundamental transformation in one’s understanding of body, mind, and the world.

II. The Proper Relationship between Teachers, Guides, and Disciples  

II.1 Proper Reliance and Attitude toward Those Worthy of Respect  
On the path of practice, finding a proper guide and awakened teacher is an important support for moving toward liberation. One should take as one’s teacher an awakened one who possesses the corresponding qualities, give rise to joy toward his pure teaching, and genuinely rely on that teaching in practice. Toward those worthy of respect, a practitioner should maintain the proper attitude, including humility, honoring, reverence, and making suitable offerings. This attitude is not merely an external etiquette, but arises from a sincere respect for the Dhamma and for virtue.

In dealing with people at different stages of practice, there are corresponding principles of admonition. Toward one who is negligent and heedless, one should admonish him with words so that he becomes alert and reflective. Toward one who abides in heedfulness, one should take refuge in him and pay homage, in order to highlight the correctness of his conduct and to express respect and rejoicing. In this way, with regard both to people and to the Dhamma, a wholesome relationship of reliance naturally takes shape: one does not indulge heedlessness, and one actively praises the efforts of the heedful.

II.2 Respecting Teachers and Establishing the Lineage of Transmission  
In the teacher–disciple relationship, respect is the fundamental rule. One should maintain utmost sincerity and respect toward one’s guide and express this respect through concrete actions, not merely by words. Only in this way can a proper lineage relationship be truly established, allowing the transmission of the teaching and the sharing of experiential realization to flow genuinely. As a disciple, on the one hand, one should accurately know and see one’s own level and must not claim realization without having realized it, fabricating attainments one has never reached. On the other hand, one should take the Dhamma as one’s reliance, not merely personal feelings and preferences, and at the same time should respect all practitioners, without belittling one’s companions on the path.

In the process of establishing the teacher–disciple relationship, the disciple must constantly observe his own bodily and mental states, honestly acknowledging his own level, relying on the Dhamma and the teacher’s instruction, thereby proceeding steadily along the correct path. Such a teacher–disciple relationship is not a merely formal attachment; it is an interaction and inheritance centered on the Dhamma.

II.3 Direct Guidance by the Teacher and the Levels of Accomplishment  
Among the many conditions for practice, direct guidance by a teacher is the most excellent condition for pure practice. Because there is a teacher personally leading the way, the disciple can strive unremittingly to achieve what has not yet been achieved, obtain what has not yet been obtained, and realize what has not yet been realized. The broad and perfect wisdom a disciple attains is often precisely the special benefit he receives from the teacher. Because the teacher points out the direction, corrects deviations, and arouses deep reflection, the disciple can gradually rise through the levels of practice.

On this path, the disciple is one who follows that path and accomplishes on the basis of that path. True accomplishment is attained by following the path indicated by the teacher, not by arbitrary guessing and reckless behavior. When a disciple can skillfully receive the teacher’s instruction and put the Dhamma he has heard into practice in body and mind, a series of mature qualities will become evident. When the time is ripe for the Tathāgata’s final Nibbāna, if the disciple already understands the teaching, has tamed body and mind, is fearless and secure, is learned, able to retain the Dhamma and to practice in accordance with the Dhamma, and moreover practices harmony and respect, follows the Dhamma, skillfully receives the teacher’s instruction, and can proclaim, teach, expound, reveal, explain, and clarify the Dhamma, as well as rightly refute others’ slander and lead beings to liberation by teaching the Dhamma—such accomplishment of a disciple constitutes an important condition for the Tathāgata’s entering final Nibbāna.

II.4 Differences in Faculties and Modes of Teaching  
When guiding disciples, a teacher will teach according to differences in their spiritual faculties. For those of superior faculties, they can fully receive the teaching and regard the speaker of the Dhamma as their lamp, their protection, and their refuge. Therefore, for such disciples the teacher will thoroughly explain the complete teaching, enabling them to grasp it as fully as possible. For those of middling faculties, they likewise can receive the teaching and similarly take the speaker of the Dhamma as their lamp, protection, and refuge. Thus, the teacher will also thoroughly explain the complete teaching to them, without any reservation.

As for those of inferior faculties, although they find it difficult to receive the teaching in its entirety, the purpose of imparting the Dhamma is the hope that even if they understand only a single sentence of Dhamma, they may thereby obtain long‑term benefit and happiness. Therefore, even when facing those of inferior faculties, the teacher will still explain the teaching in full, so that within the limits of what they can bear, the seeds of the Dhamma may be planted. Hence, a speaker of the Dhamma is not stingy in teaching because of differences in faculties, but instead assists each practitioner in different ways, so that each may benefit from the Dhamma as much as possible.

II.5 The Highest Practitioners of Self‑Reliance and Reliance on the Dhamma  
Among all practitioners who diligently study the teaching, those who, regardless of whether the teacher is still in the world or has passed away, can practice self‑reliance and reliance on the Dhamma are regarded as the foremost practitioners. Such people should practice this path not only while the Buddha is in the world, but should likewise follow this path after the Buddha’s passing. Because they diligently study this Dhamma, they become the foremost bhikkhus and, in their practice, attain the ultimate security that self‑reliance and reliance on the Dhamma bring.

The attitude of self‑reliance and reliance on the Dhamma prevents practitioners from falling into attachment to external appearances and enables them to internalize what they have learned as a stable support. When the teacher is in the world, they can skillfully receive instruction; after the teacher’s passing, they can still, based on their own understanding and practice of the Dhamma, avoid backsliding. This is the mark of the highest practitioners and the true verification of the fruits of practice.

III. Seekers of the Path and Companions in Practice  

III.1 The Thirst of the Seeker and His State of Practice  
A genuine seeker of the path cherishes the teaching with the same feeling that a thirsty traveler longs to drink water, showing great concentration and dedication. This thirst is not a momentary impulse, but a deep and enduring longing for the path of liberation. One who has wisdom can recognize and draw upon such a teaching and will continue to practice it without interruption, not allowing what he has heard to remain superficial. For such seekers, the preliminary conditions—drawing near to good friends, purity of virtuous conduct, fullness of aspiration, personal fullness, fullness of right view, heedfulness, and wise attention—will naturally be gradually fulfilled in their lives, becoming a firm foundation for deepening on the path.

III.2 Companions in Practice as Fundamental Conditions for Accomplishment  
Accomplishment in practice is often not attained in isolation; it is closely related to companions in practice and good spiritual mentors. One of the fundamental conditions of accomplishment is having companions on the path with whom one advances together. By maintaining long‑term fellowship with good spiritual mentors, mutually supporting one another in the true Dhamma and jointly cultivating the true Dhamma, one keeps daily life and the direction of practice in harmony. In addition, one must rely on the teaching spoken by the Buddha, basing all criteria of practice on the path proclaimed by the Buddha. Only thus does accomplishment have a firm basis rather than deviating from the track.

III.3 The Positive Cycle of Instruction and Younger Practitioners  
Correct instruction gives rise to a wholesome cycle. Younger practitioners, seeing the virtuous, aspire to emulate them; they observe and learn the exemplary qualities of seniors or virtuous ones, and thereby cultivate their own virtue and understanding. As they gradually come to possess these exemplary qualities, they will be respected by the elders. This respect is not merely a formal courtesy; it brings long‑term benefit and happiness, making the younger practitioners’ confidence and courage in the true Dhamma even more stable. Such a positive cycle of instruction allows the holy life to be transmitted from generation to generation without decline.

IV. Criteria for Observing Good Friends and Practitioners  

IV.1 Long‑term Interaction and Wise Observation  
To judge a practitioner’s level and whether he is worth drawing near to and relying upon, one must follow certain criteria of observation. First, there must be long‑term interaction, not a judgment based on brief contact. Short‑term association often reveals only the surface and cannot truly perceive the other’s inner virtue. Second, one must engage in deep reflection, not careless thought. Observation of a person should involve repeated consideration and examination, not be based merely on a momentary impression. Third, one must use wisdom in observation, not judge with an unwise eye. Only by observing with wisdom can one distinguish true good from evil, reality from falsity.

IV.2 Four Ways of Observation and the Standard of a Good Person  
In concrete terms, there are four ways of observation that can be used to determine a practitioner’s actual state. By living together, one can observe whether his observance of precepts is rigorous. Through conversation, one can observe whether his mind is pure. When he faces adversity, one can observe whether his character is stable and not swayed by circumstances. Through mutual discussion, one can observe the depth of his wisdom and whether he can rightly distinguish the meanings of the Dhamma. These four approaches mutually complement one another and can help a practitioner more accurately recognize good friends and teachers.

At the same time, in choosing good people as companions, one must discern whether they meet the basic standard of a good person. A truly good person is one who has already extinguished greed, hatred, and delusion in the heart and can speak words that accord with the Dhamma. If in a person’s words and deeds one can see the embodiment of virtuous conduct, purity, stability, and wisdom, and he also meets the basic standard of a good person, he is worth drawing near to over the long term and learning from.

IV.3 Mutual Praise among Noble Ones and the Role of Disciples  
Practitioners of lesser virtue often rely on noble ones of lofty virtue; such reliance is like small stones leaning against a snow mountain or a small lump of salt in a large jar of brine. By leaning on great virtue, their own virtue is supported and nourished. Noble ones themselves possess great spiritual power and great influence and can dwell long as they wish. Therefore, they can long protect the Dhamma and disciples, enabling many more people to rely on their teaching and benefit.

Within such a lineage of the Dhamma, the disciple’s role is to follow that path and attain accomplishment through that path. The disciple is not following a person for the sake of a person, but relies on the path practiced by the noble ones and takes that path as the standard for his own practice and accomplishment. When a disciple, on the one hand, leans on the noble ones’ virtue, and on the other hand takes the path as his real refuge, he can maintain humility while remaining firmly established in the true path.

V. The True Dhamma, Hearing the Teaching, and Nibbāna  

V.1 Hearing the Teaching Leading to Peace and the Conditions for Nibbāna  
Whether one can enter Nibbāna in this very life is related to whether one has heard the true Dhamma. Those who have not heard the teaching leading to peace from the Tathāgata or from virtuous bhikkhus lack, in this life, the fundamental condition for entering Nibbāna, and thus establish the condition for not entering Nibbāna in this very life. Conversely, if one can hear the teaching leading to peace from the Tathāgata or from virtuous bhikkhus, one possesses the necessary condition for entering Nibbāna in this life. Thus, whether one truly comes into contact with and hears the true Dhamma that leads to peace directly affects whether or not there is liberation.

V.2 External Conditional Factors and the Image of the Speaker of the Dhamma  
In summarizing the elements of practical cultivation, there are several particularly important factors among the external conditions. First, there must be a teacher who can teach the true Dhamma. Second, there must be the content of the true Dhamma itself. Third, one must have the opportunity to draw near to the teacher, to actually meet and receive instruction from the speaker of the Dhamma. These external conditions enable practitioners to hear the Dhamma that leads to peace and liberation and to implement it in daily life.

Within a community of practitioners, there will be people who possess four particular qualities and who are rejoiced in by heavenly beings and regarded by the heavenly beings as their own kind. This shows that heavenly beings also use the Dhamma and virtue as their standards of measure; toward practitioners who accord with the Dhamma and possess the corresponding qualities, they naturally give rise to rejoicing and recognition. When a practitioner becomes one whom the heavenly beings acknowledge as a kindred, this also indicates his maturity in the Dhamma and his accumulated merits.

V.3 Correct Methods of Practice and Establishing Right View  
In actual methods of practice, one must establish right view. A practitioner should see the noble ones, know the Dhamma of the noble ones, and act in accordance with the noble ones’ Dhamma. He should also see good spiritual mentors, know the Dhamma of good spiritual mentors, and act in accordance with their Dhamma. By drawing near to noble ones and good spiritual mentors, understanding their Dhamma and practice, and then following along to cultivate it, he avoids deviating from the path of liberation.

More specifically, the practical points and core pathway of the method of practice are: drawing near to good spiritual mentors, hearing the true Dhamma, correctly reflecting on the Dhamma, and practicing in accordance with the Dhamma. Only by drawing near to good spiritual mentors can one hear the true Dhamma from them. After hearing the true Dhamma, one must apply wise attention, rightly reflecting inwardly on the Dhamma heard. Next, one must practice in accordance with the Dhamma, acting according to the teaching, so that what has been heard and reflected upon is truly implemented in bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. Drawing near to virtuous persons, hearing the true Dhamma, wise attention, and practicing in accordance with the Dhamma—these are at once the four factors of stream‑entry and the fundamental principles for the accomplishment of wisdom, running through the entire path of practice.

VI. Offerings, Good Friends, and the Attitude of Heavenly Beings  

VI.1 The Supreme Recipients of Offerings and the Proper Attitude in Giving  
In the principles of meritorious gifts, there are supreme recipients of offerings. These include the noble Saṅgha endowed with the four paths and four fruits, practitioners who possess right view, and members of the Saṅgha endowed with wisdom, virtue, and concentration. Toward such worthy ones, practitioners should embrace an attitude of humility, honoring, reverence, and making suitable offerings, regarding giving as rejoicing in and supporting the true Dhamma and the pure holy life, and not merely as a matter of worldly courtesy.

When practitioners make offerings to the supreme recipients with the proper attitude, they both accumulate merit and deepen their own confidence in the Dhamma and the Saṅgha, thereby standing more firmly within the true Dhamma.

VI.2 Good Friends as the Entirety of the Holy Life and the Fruits of Practice  
From the various teachings it can be seen that good friends are repeatedly indicated to be the entirety of the holy life. Good friends are the complete foundation for practicing the holy life, not merely a part of it. Having good friends is the complete condition for accomplishing the pure holy life; lacking good friends, the holy life cannot be fully realized in its totality. Under such reliance, practitioners can repeatedly cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path and, by means of good friends, be liberated from birth, aging, death, and the various phenomena of sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress.

Furthermore, when practitioners, supported by good friends and good spiritual mentors, gradually accomplish self‑reliance and reliance on the Dhamma, they can practice this path both while the Buddha is in the world and after his passing. Those who diligently study this Dhamma naturally become the foremost bhikkhus and, within body and mind, experience the ultimate security that self‑reliance and reliance on the Dhamma bring. Such fruits of practice highlight the fundamental place of good friends and good spiritual mentors on the path to liberation.

VI.3 Instructing Relatives and Friends and the Attitude of Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Beings  
Toward friends, relatives, and blood relations who should be pitied and cared for, one should, with a compassionate mind, exhort them to cultivate the four factors of stream‑entry, namely: drawing near to virtuous persons, hearing the true Dhamma, wise attention, and practicing in accordance with the Dhamma. In this way, one can benefit relatives and friends with the actual meaning of the Dhamma, enabling them likewise to enter the stream of the true Dhamma.

On a broader level, heavenly kings also have principles of admonition toward beings. Toward those who are heedless, the heavenly king admonishes them with words to awaken them. Toward those who abide in heedfulness, the heavenly king takes refuge in and pays homage to them, to express respect and affirm the path they walk. As for the hosts of heavenly beings, they give rise to rejoicing toward those who possess four specific qualities and regard them as their own kind. Thus, whether in the human realm or in the heavenly realms, people who can draw near to good friends, hear the Dhamma and cultivate the path, avoid heedlessness, and possess the corresponding virtues are met with respect and rejoicing.

In summary, good friends, good spiritual mentors, and the true Dhamma are the complete conditions for the pure holy life and for liberation. By drawing near to good people, respecting teachers, rightly hearing and reflecting on the true Dhamma, and adding to this the actual implementation of the teaching together with the stable attitude of self‑reliance and reliance on the Dhamma, practitioners can find a way out from birth, aging, sickness, and death and from sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress, and ultimately advance toward the supreme security of Nibbāna.
