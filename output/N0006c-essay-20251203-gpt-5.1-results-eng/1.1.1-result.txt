<article>
I. The Basic Meaning and Universal Characteristics of the Principle of Dependent Origination  
I.1 The Overall Concept of Dependent Origination  

All phenomena do not arise in isolation; they necessarily appear in dependence upon the coming together of specific conditions, and when these conditions disperse, they inevitably perish along with them. This principle of mutual dependence, “arising dependent on conditions and ceasing with the disappearance of conditions,” is the core spirit of the law of dependent origination. In its most concise form, dependent origination is the causal structure: “When this exists, that exists; when this arises, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not exist; when this ceases, that ceases.” It explains that all phenomena arise in dependence on preceding conditions; there is no dharma that stands independently of causes and conditions.

This law has the qualities of being non-deceptive, not deviating from suchness, and necessarily interdependent. “Non-deceptive” means it is not a subjective hypothesis, but an objective law that can be directly verified. “Not different from suchness” means it is always thus; it does not change according to personal likes and dislikes. “Interdependent” points out that all dharmas appear only in mutual dependence; there is no absolutely independent entity. Whether or not the Tathāgata appears in the world, this causal law of dependent origination already exists. It has definiteness, lawfulness, and establishedness. What the Tathāgata does is simply to know this dharma as it really is with the wisdom of an awakened one, and then to reveal and teach it, so that beings may understand and practice.

Therefore, the principle of dependent origination does not merely explain one particular class of phenomena, but applies universally to all dependently originated dharmas, including such key factors as aging-and-death, birth, existence (becoming), clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, formations, and ignorance. All of these operate under the same principle: when this exists, that exists; when this antecedent arises, that arises with it; when this antecedent ceases, that correspondingly ceases. The arising and cessation of all dharmas unfold without exception according to such conditional relations.

I.2 The Dependence of Suffering on Dependent Origination  

Suffering itself is also part of dependent origination. The arising and ceasing of suffering can occur only within the range of conditions that bring about the accumulation of suffering; it never exists as an independent entity apart from causes and conditions. For all the factors that constitute the experiential world, their arising, persisting, re-arising, and manifestation inevitably bring with them the arising and manifestation of suffering, illness, aging, and death. Conversely, when these constitutive factors cease, become still, and terminate, suffering, illness, aging, and death necessarily cease and terminate along with them. When the body made of the four great elements arises, persists, and re-arises, this is precisely the arising of suffering, the persisting of craving, and the manifestation of aging-and-death. When the four elements cease, grow calm, and are utterly extinguished, this is precisely the ceasing of suffering, the stilling of craving, and the utter ending of aging-and-death.

From this it is clear that the accumulation of suffering and the cessation of suffering are not accidental, but are completely integrated into the causal chain of dependent arising and dependent cessation. So long as those conditions that lead toward suffering exist, the various forms of suffering will inevitably appear. When those conditions are completely brought to an end, suffering is likewise extinguished without remainder.

II. The Twelve Links of Dependent Origination and the Causal Chain of the Aggregate of Suffering  
II.1 The Complete Sequence of Dependent Origination in Forward Order  

The accumulation of all aggregates of suffering in the world can be expressed by the twelve links of dependent origination. Their forward order of arising is as follows: With ignorance as condition, there are formations; with formations as condition, there is consciousness; with consciousness as condition, there is name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, there are the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, there is contact; with contact as condition, there is feeling; with feeling as condition, there is craving; with craving as condition, there is clinging; with clinging as condition, there is existence (becoming); with existence as condition, there is birth; with birth as condition, there are aging-and-death, and sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, despair, and all aggregates of suffering. This continuous process of arising is the accumulation of all distress and all aggregates of suffering; it is the complete structure of the arising of the world and the arising of suffering.

In some descriptions, the final resultant link is summarized simply as “suffering,” encompassing aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, despair, and related phenomena; the meaning is the same, namely the totality of all suffering. Regardless of how it is phrased, this causal chain that begins with ignorance and culminates in aging-and-death and all sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair is the standard model of the forward-flowing dependent origination.

II.2 The Reverse Order of Dependent Cessation  

The same causal chain can also be observed from the perspective of cessation. When ignorance is completely eradicated, the formations as fabrications cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; with the cessation of consciousness, name-and-form ceases; with the cessation of name-and-form, the six sense bases cease; with the cessation of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases; with the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair—all aggregates of suffering—are brought to an end. This is the complete process by which all aggregates of suffering are extinguished.

Thus, from the standpoint of forward flow, it is: “With ignorance as condition there are formations; with formations as condition there is consciousness … up to with birth as condition there are aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair,” thereby achieving the accumulation of all aggregates of suffering. From the standpoint of reverse cessation, it is: “With the cessation of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases … up to with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease,” thereby achieving the cessation of all aggregates of suffering. Forward flow and reverse cessation are just two modes of manifestation of the same principle of dependent origination.

II.3 The Universality and Two-Way Structure of the Dependent Chain  

Within the relations of dependent origination, as soon as any link arises, the subsequent links will occur in sequence, leading to the accumulation of the aggregates of suffering. Likewise, as soon as any link is completely brought to cessation, the subsequent links will cease in sequence, ultimately reaching the cessation of all aggregates of suffering. This temporally ordered causal sequence runs through the entire chain from ignorance to aging-and-death.

The order of dependent origination is clearly two-directional. On the one hand, one can observe its generation in forward sequence: ignorance leads to formations; formations lead to consciousness; consciousness leads to name-and-form; name-and-form leads to the six sense bases; the six sense bases lead to contact; contact leads to feeling; feeling leads to craving; craving leads to clinging; clinging leads to existence; existence leads to birth; birth leads to the arising of aging-and-death and all aggregates of suffering. On the other hand, one can also observe its cessation in reverse sequence: with the cessation of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; with the cessation of consciousness, name-and-form ceases; with the cessation of name-and-form, the six sense bases cease; with the cessation of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases; with the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death and all aggregates of suffering cease. The causal sequence remains exactly the same in both forward flow and reverse cessation; only the direction differs.

II.4 Fundamental Links and Functional Classification  

When the entire causal chain is summarized, its fundamental components are the twelve links: ignorance, formations, consciousness, name-and-form, the six sense bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, and aging-and-death. Among these, ignorance belongs to the root factor; it is the original fundamental cause. From formations to existence belong to the process factors; they are the intermediate conditions by which the aggregates of suffering are formed. Birth, aging-and-death, and all sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair belong to the resultant factors; they are the manifested fruits of the entire causal chain.

The reason worldly beings are trapped in suffering such as birth, aging, and death, unable to escape, is precisely that they are bound by this causal chain without realizing it. Only by using right reflection and wisdom to investigate carefully the causes and conditions of the arising of suffering, and to understand each link from ignorance to aging-and-death, can one truly comprehend the overall structure of the accumulation and cessation of the aggregates of suffering.

III. The Concrete Definitions of Each Link and Their Not-Self Characteristic  
III.1 The Content and Definitions of the Twelve Links  

Among the twelve links of dependent origination, formations are the three kinds of fabrication—bodily formations, verbal formations, and mental formations—that arise dependent on ignorance; they are the actual initiation of all karmic activities. Consciousness is the function of discernment and cognition, arising dependent on formations. Name-and-form is a collective term for the mental and material aspects. “Name” includes mental factors such as feeling, perception, and volition; “form” refers to material form. Name-and-form arises dependent on consciousness. When name-and-form matures, it gives rise to the six kinds of cognitive faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind; these are the six sense bases. When the six sense bases encounter their corresponding external objects, and consciousness is also involved, there is the coming together of sense faculty, object, and consciousness; this coming together is called contact. Contact is the direct precondition for the arising of feeling.

Feeling is the experiential tone evoked by contact, including pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling. When craving and thirst arise in the mind toward these feelings, that is craving. Craving clings tenaciously to objects and feelings, further developing into grasping and pursuit; this is clinging. The power of attachment formed by clinging creates the karmic conditions for continued existence in saṃsāra; this is existence (becoming). Existence provides the basis for the arising of a new life, therefore from existence there is birth. Birth is the process by which beings are reborn into various forms of existence. Once there is birth, aging and death inevitably accompany it. Aging refers to the decline and deterioration of bodily functions; death is the ending of life and the disintegration of the aggregates. Accompanying aging-and-death are sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, despair, and various other mental and physical afflictions; together these are called the totality of the aggregate of suffering or the totality of suffering.

III.2 The Not-Self Character of Each Link and the Impossibility of Clinging  

In contemplating the twelve links, one should not cling to any link as an independently self-existing entity, still less regard it as “self” or “mine.” When aging-and-death arise, one should not further inquire, “To whom does aging-and-death belong?” The phenomenon of birth should not be grasped as inherently existing in itself. Likewise, existence, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, and the six sense bases should not be regarded as independent and unchanging entities. Name-and-form, as the coming together of mentality and materiality, is itself dependently arisen and dependently ceased; it cannot be grasped as a self-substance. The discriminative function of consciousness is the same—merely a function arising from conditions. Formations, as activities of fabrication, likewise should not be grasped with the notion “to whom do these formations belong?” Among all of these, the imagination of self and what belongs to self is merely a mistaken superimposition.

Further, all elements that constitute the world—be they body and mind, the six sense bases, name-and-form, the five aggregates, or various mental activities—have no substantial “self” or “what belongs to self” in their nature. The proper way to contemplate is not to think: “This itself truly exists,” not to think: “Its existence is truly established,” not to rely on it in one’s thinking, and not to think: “This is mine.” Only thus does one avoid constructing views of self and grasps of possession upon dependently arisen dharmas.

III.3 The Dependent Origination and Impermanence of the Five Aggregates and the Four Great Elements  

The five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—also follow the law of dependent origination. The form aggregate arises with the four great elements as its cause and condition. The feeling aggregate, the perception aggregate, and the formations aggregate arise with contact as their cause and condition. The consciousness aggregate arises with name-and-form as its cause and condition. Because these causes and conditions themselves are impermanent, the five aggregates are necessarily impermanent. Form arises from impermanent causes and conditions; therefore form is impermanent. Feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are likewise so: all are based on impermanent causes and conditions, and thus are themselves impermanent.

The arising, persisting, re-arising, and manifestation of the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—constitute the arising of suffering, the persisting of craving, and the manifestation of aging-and-death. The ceasing, stilling, and complete extinction of the four great elements constitute the ceasing of suffering, the stilling of craving, and the complete extinction of aging-and-death. Because all constitutive factors are inseparable from the fundamental pains of birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, they are called “blind darkness,” for within the range constituted by them, beings are never able to escape the bondage of fundamental suffering.

IV. The Nature of Ignorance, Unwholesome States, and Wrong Views  
IV.1 The Definition and Function of Ignorance  

Ignorance is the initiating key of this chain of dependent origination and the common root and hub of all unwholesome states. Ignorance, first of all, is the lack of correct understanding of the Four Noble Truths: not understanding the true nature of suffering, not understanding the origin of suffering, not understanding the cessation of suffering, and not understanding the path leading to the cessation of suffering. In terms of dependent origination itself, ignorance is specifically unknowing with respect to suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering—these four truths. This state of not knowing exists in ordinary people who have not heard the true Dharma; one who dwells in ignorance is living in such a condition of utter unawareness of reality.

When ignorance is present as a forerunner, various unwholesome states arise along with it, and they manifest accompanied by lack of conscience and lack of shame. When knowledge (clarity) is present as a forerunner, wholesome states arise dependent on knowledge and are strengthened by conscience and shame. Thus it is evident that ignorance is not merely a blind spot in cognition, but directly affects behavior and mental activity, such that all fabrications and cognitions are defiled by it.

IV.2 The Relationship Between Ignorance and Formations, and Karmic Formations  

Formations take ignorance as their fundamental cause, source, origin, and starting point. All one’s own karmic formations and those of others arise dependent on ignorance; ignorance thus becomes the root of all karmic activities. From the perspective of dependent origination, because of ignorance there are formations; because of formations there is consciousness; and so on, extending step by step until the entire aggregate of suffering is accumulated. If ignorance is completely abandoned and eradicated, together with the cessation of craving, formations accordingly cease. With the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; in this way, link after link ceases in turn, ultimately bringing about the cessation of all aggregates of suffering.

IV.3 Wrong Views and the Prejudice of Denying Conditions  

Ignorance also manifests in wrong views. Some views deny conditions, claiming that beings’ defilement and purity are without cause and without condition, or asserting that everything is predetermined, that experiences of pleasure and pain are all determined by some fixed nature. These are all wrong views of non-causality. Other faulty theories of the cause of suffering claim that suffering is produced solely by oneself, solely by others, jointly by oneself and others, or that suffering arises naturally without a cause. From the standpoint of dependent origination, if one departs from “contact” as a necessary condition, suffering cannot arise at all; thus suffering is neither purely produced by oneself, nor purely by others, nor jointly by self and others, nor does it arise without cause. Any view that denies causes and conditions, or denies conditional arising, is contrary to the correct principle of dependent origination.

The law of dependent origination also points out that lack of wisdom and lack of right view themselves have their causes and conditions; they do not arise without cause or condition. Conversely, wisdom and right view also have their causes and conditions; they do not arise by accident or without reason. When beings have not yet realized these causal structures and relations of dependence, they are like people entangled in knots, trapped within suffering and unable to escape from the evil destinies of saṃsāra.

V. The Arising and Ceasing of Suffering, Contact, Feeling, and Craving  
V.1 Contact as the Direct Condition for Suffering and Feeling  

Suffering is a phenomenon that arises dependent upon causes and conditions; its direct condition is contact. All experiences of suffering must rely on the presence of contact; without contact, suffering cannot arise. The root of the arising of suffering lies in the sense faculties, their corresponding external objects, and the consciousness that arises from their interaction. When these three meet, there is contact; from contact, feeling arises; from feeling, craving arises. This craving is the fundamental reason why suffering can accumulate and arise. Thus suffering does not arise independently of contact, nor is it solely given by others, nor jointly produced by self and others, nor produced without cause; it necessarily depends upon contact as its condition.

In more general terms, all kinds of feeling—pleasant, painful, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful—arise from the combination of causes and conditions, among which contact is an indispensable necessary condition. Without relying on contact, there can be no experience of pleasure or pain. All feelings, whatever their nature, arise without exception dependent on specific causes and conditions.

V.2 The Six Sense Faculties and Six Sense Objects in the Process of Generating the Aggregate of Suffering  

The generation of the aggregates of suffering in the world must begin from the interaction of the six sense faculties and their six corresponding objects. When the six faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—encounter the corresponding external objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—and when consciousness is also present, the three of faculty, object, and consciousness together form contact. From contact, feeling arises. When feeling appears, the mind reacts in various ways to pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling. If, from this, craving and thirst arise, this is craving. As craving further intensifies, it becomes grasping; from grasping arise the karmic conditions for existence, which is existence (becoming). Existence brings about the arising of a new life, and thus birth occurs. With birth comes aging-and-death, along with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, despair, and hopelessness; together these constitute the arising of the world and of the aggregate of suffering.

The same principle applies universally to all six sensory avenues. For every sense door, the generation of the aggregates of suffering begins with a chain reaction initiated by contact: the coming together of faculty, object, and consciousness yields contact; from contact comes feeling; from feeling comes craving; from craving comes clinging; from clinging comes existence; from existence comes birth; from birth come aging-and-death and the various forms of suffering. When cessation occurs, it begins with the extinction of craving: with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death and all sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are brought to an end.

V.3 Craving and Clinging, Existence and Birth-and-Death  

Within the entire structure of dependent origination, craving is one of the key hubs. When beings dwell in the “pleasure-aspect observation” of objects and feelings—that is, they observe only what is lovable, enjoyable, and worthy of craving—their craving increases. With the increase of craving, clinging arises; with the arising of clinging, existence arises; from existence arises a life that subsequently leads to the appearance of aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. Thus the entire aggregate of suffering is accumulated. Conversely, if one does not dwell in the pleasure-aspect observation of objects and the five aggregates, but contemplates their drawbacks, craving gradually ceases. With the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death and all sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease, and the entire aggregate of suffering is likewise extinguished.

In some summaries, the generative sequence of the aggregate of suffering can be condensed into four stages: craving, clinging, existence, and the aggregate of suffering. If one does not investigate craving, clinging arises; where there is clinging, existence is formed; where there is existence, future birth and the aggregate of suffering are incurred. Conversely, if one does not give rise to joy and attachment toward the five aggregates subject to clinging, there will be no delight; without delight there will be no clinging; without clinging there will be no existence; without existence there will be no new birth; without birth there will be no aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. Thus the aggregate of suffering is brought to cessation.

V.4 Thought and the Abiding of Consciousness in Driving the Aggregate of Suffering  

Thought and the abiding of consciousness have a decisive impact on the forward flow of dependent origination. When consciousness abides and grows, name-and-form manifests along with it. When name-and-form manifests, the six sense bases arise. When the six sense bases arise, contact arises. When contact arises, feeling arises. After feeling, craving, clinging, existence, and birth arise in sequence, ultimately leading to birth, aging, death, and sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, thereby constituting the accumulation of the entire aggregate of suffering. The aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair brought about by future rebirth are precisely the consequences of the abiding and growth of consciousness; they are the concrete manifestation of the accumulation of the aggregate of suffering.

Conversely, if consciousness cannot abide and does not grow, name-and-form will not manifest. When name-and-form does not manifest, the subsequent six sense bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, and birth will not arise in succession; thus the accumulation of the aggregate of suffering is cut off. Because consciousness is completely extinguished, name-and-form also ceases; in this way, there is the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering. This shows that the manifestation and extinction of consciousness have a direct and decisive effect on the arising and ceasing of the aggregate of suffering.

V.5 Food and Craving in Driving Future Suffering in Rebirth  

The law of the forward flow of dependent origination can also be observed from the relationship between “food” and craving. When beings give rise to greed, delight, and craving toward any of the four kinds of nutriment—solid food, contact as nutriment, mental volition as nutriment, or consciousness as nutriment—consciousness is thereby able to abide and grow. When consciousness abides and grows, name-and-form manifests along with it. When name-and-form manifests, formations become intensified. When formations are intensified, the future rebirth of the next existence is formed. Once future rebirth is formed, it leads to future birth and aging-and-death. As long as there will be future birth and aging-and-death, sorrow, pain, and distress will inevitably accompany them. This law of forward flow applies generally to craving for any of the four kinds of nutriment; regardless of which form of nutriment one craves, the causal chain will follow the same pattern and ultimately lead to the accumulation of the aggregate of suffering.

V.6 Observation and Investigation of the Roots of Suffering  

In the practice of contemplation, one should carefully investigate from where sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise and from where they become manifest. From the perspective of dependent origination, aging-and-death and the various sufferings take birth as their fundamental cause; where there is birth, there must be aging-and-death; where there is no birth, there is no aging-and-death. Birth takes existence as its cause; existence takes clinging as its cause; clinging takes craving as its cause; craving takes feeling as its cause; feeling takes contact as its cause; contact takes the six sense bases as its cause; the six sense bases take name-and-form as their cause; name-and-form takes consciousness as its cause; consciousness takes formations as its cause; formations take ignorance as their fundamental cause. Where there is ignorance, there are formations; where there is no ignorance, there are no formations. By tracing back in this way, one can see how the remote and proximate causes of suffering are mutually dependent layer by layer.

VI. The Mutual Dependence of Name-and-Form, Consciousness, and Formations  
VI.1 The Interdependence of Name-and-Form and Consciousness  

Among the twelve links, there is an especially close mutual dependence between name-and-form and consciousness. Sometimes we say “dependent on consciousness there is name-and-form,” because without the cognitive function of consciousness, “name” and “form” cannot appear as the psychophysical structure of a sentient being. At the same time, we can also say “dependent on name-and-form there is consciousness,” because without the mental and material basis, consciousness has nowhere to abide or function. Name-and-form and consciousness support each other, like two bundles of reeds leaning against one another: if one is removed, the other cannot stand alone. From this perspective, the manifestation of consciousness brings about the arising of name-and-form, and the extinction of consciousness leads to the cessation of name-and-form; this mutual dependence itself is inseparable from the overall chain of dependent origination.

VI.2 Formations Taking Ignorance as Their Root  

As the second link, formations take ignorance entirely as their fundamental cause and starting point. All activities of bodily, verbal, and mental fabrication that take ignorance as their forerunner become karmic conditions capable of driving consciousness, name-and-form, the six sense bases, and eventually aging, death, and suffering. If worldly formations are not guided by knowledge (clarity), there is not a single one that is not tainted by ignorance. Because of ignorance there are formations; because of formations there is consciousness … all the way up to the accumulation of aging-and-death and all sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. This whole process is driven by a causal chain that begins with ignorance.

VI.3 The One-Way Law Within Cognitive Activity  

In the cognitive process, the law of dependent origination also displays a one-way directionality. From the sensory elements, contact can arise, but from contact the sensory elements themselves cannot be produced in reverse. From contact, feeling can arise, but feeling cannot in turn produce contact. From feeling, subsequent mental activities—such as desire, heat (agitation), seeking, and obtaining—can arise, but these later mental activities cannot produce their preceding stages, such as feeling, contact, thinking, and perception. This one-way law applies universally across all six spheres of cognition. For example, dependent on a visual object, a visual perception can arise, but dependent on a visual perception, the visual object itself cannot be produced. Dependent on the desire for a dhamma, the obtaining of that dhamma can arise, but dependent on obtaining the dhamma, the desire for it cannot be produced again. This shows that dependent origination is not arbitrarily reversible, but has a definite causal direction.

VII. Understanding Dependent Origination, Right Knowledge, and the Path to Liberation  
VII.1 The Fourfold Knowledge of Each Link of Dependent Origination  

To be a genuine practitioner, one must possess the complete fourfold knowledge regarding the twelve links of dependent origination. These twelve links include aging-and-death, birth, existence, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, and formations. For each link, one needs to know as it really is its nature, the cause of its arising, the state of its cessation, and the practical path leading to its cessation. These four kinds of knowledge form a complete cognitive system of dependent origination and are regarded as the core content among the forty-four knowledge topics: each link of dependent origination encompasses four wisdoms, which respectively understand its nature, its accumulation, its cessation, and the path that leads toward its cessation.

Only those who are endowed with these four types of understanding can truly be called genuine practitioners, capable of realizing the truth of practice in this very life. Those who lack any one of these are not genuine practitioners and cannot realize the truth in this present life. Therefore, any ascetic or brahmin who cannot thoroughly understand the nature, causes of arising, methods of cessation, and path leading to the cessation of the twelve links of dependent origination from aging-and-death back to formations is only nominally an ascetic or brahmin; in reality they do not qualify as such and cannot in this life personally realize and abide in the true meaning of being an ascetic or brahmin. Conversely, if they can completely understand these twelve links and fully master the fourfold knowledge just described, then name and reality coincide: they are true ascetics and brahmins, capable of realizing and abiding in their true meaning in this very life.

VII.2 The Basic Pattern of Contemplating Dependent Origination and Its Extension Across the Three Times  

When contemplating dependent origination, one needs to establish a complete and systematic mode of observation. First is the present-time observation of cause and effect: the wisdom that sees “when this condition is present, that dharma is present” and “when this condition is absent, that dharma is absent,” understanding that when a given condition exists, a corresponding dharma must exist; when that condition does not exist, that dharma must also not exist. Further, one must extend this understanding to past and future: contemplating in past lives that “when this condition was present, that dharma was present” and “when this condition was absent, that dharma was absent”; and likewise contemplating for future lives that “when this condition will be present, that dharma will be present” and “when this condition will be absent, that dharma will be absent.” Only by thus extending through the three times can one truly realize the inherent lawfulness of all dependently arisen dharmas and their susceptibility to cessation.

In the concrete application to the twelve links, one can observe in sequence: with ignorance as condition, formations arise; with formations as condition, consciousness arises; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form arises; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases arise; with the six sense bases as condition, contact arises; with contact as condition, feeling arises; with feeling as condition, craving arises; with craving as condition, clinging arises; with clinging as condition, existence arises; with existence as condition, birth arises; with birth as condition, aging-and-death arises. At the same time, one also observes that with the cessation of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; and so on up to with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death ceases. This dual perspective of contemplating dependent origination in forward and reverse order enables the practitioner to fully understand the entire process of the arising and cessation of the world.

VII.3 The Distinction Between Right Knowledge and Not-Right Knowledge, and the Qualification for Practice  

One who possesses right knowledge knows as it really is the nature of aging-and-death, birth, existence, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, and formations; knows the causes of their arising; knows their cessation; and knows the practical path leading to their cessation. Those who lack this fourfold knowledge cannot be called true practitioners and cannot realize the truth in this very life. Therefore, anyone who cannot yet see the twelve links of dependent origination as they really are must seek correct guidance and methods of practice in order gradually to establish this complete wisdom of dependent origination.

In the sequence of liberative wisdom, first comes the “knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma” (dhammathitā-ñāṇa), and only then the knowledge of nibbāna. The knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma is the direct seeing of the law of dependent origination: clearly seeing that because of ignorance there are formations, and so on up to because of birth there is aging-and-death; and also seeing that with the cessation of ignorance, formations cease, and so on up to with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death ceases. When this direct seeing matures, the knowledge of nibbāna can then appear, realizing the actual state of the cessation of the aggregate of suffering.

VII.4 Reflection on Dependent Origination and the Middle Way Beyond the Two Extremes  

In properly reflecting on dependent origination, one should not cling merely to linear verbal formulations such as “because there is X, therefore there is Y” or “because there is no X, therefore there is no Y,” ignoring the actual mutual dependence. Nor should one insistently inquire “exactly when does what arise or cease so that something else arises or ceases?” or cling to the specific detail of “due to what does each link exist or not exist?” A noble disciple does not need to rely on any external conditions, but can directly generate wisdom from this Dhamma itself, knowing as it really is the relations “when this exists, that exists; when this arises, that arises” and “when this does not exist, that does not exist; when this ceases, that ceases,” and thus fully understanding the entire process of the world’s forward flow and reverse cessation.

Right view as the Middle Way is established precisely by going beyond the two extremes of eternalism and annihilationism, relying instead on dependent origination. It observes as it really is: dependent on ignorance there are formations; dependent on formations there is consciousness, and so on, link after link, forming the accumulation of all aggregates of suffering. Likewise, with the cessation of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases, and so on, link after link, achieving the cessation of all aggregates of suffering. This mode of observation does not fall into the extreme of “everything is governed solely by oneself” nor into the extreme of “everything is governed solely by others,” nor does it sink into the view that “all is without cause and effect.” Rather, it grasps the law as it really is within the interdependence of conditions.

VII.5 The Three Stages of the Path to Liberation and the Sole Criterion  

Whether in teaching the Dhamma, in the practice of cultivation, or in the realization of liberation, all must take disenchantment, dispassion, and the eradication of the twelve factors of dependent origination as the single core criterion. These twelve factors are ignorance, formations, consciousness, name-and-form, the six sense bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, and aging-and-death. Regarding any one of these links, if a practitioner possesses right knowledge of its nature, its accumulation, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, they can, by applying the same principle, extend this understanding to the liberation of the entire causal chain. The key to liberation lies in comprehensive knowledge of dependent origination and in applying this knowledge universally to every link. As soon as one possesses these four right views regarding any one factor of dependent origination, one has already entered the right path leading to liberation.

VIII. The Universal Application of the Law of Dependent Origination to the World, the Five Aggregates, and the Aggregate of Suffering  
VIII.1 The Scope of Dependently Arisen Dharmas and the Accumulation and Cessation of the Five Aggregates  

The scope of dependently arisen dharmas encompasses such phenomena as aging-and-death, birth, existence, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, formations, and ignorance. The accumulation and cessation of all these dharmas follow the same principle of conditions. Taking the five aggregates as an example: when one rejoices in, acclaims, and remains attached to the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, delight arises; once delight has arisen, clinging to the five aggregates arises; when clinging arises, existence arises; when existence arises, life—birth—arises; when life arises, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. Thus the entire aggregate of suffering is accumulated. If, however, one does not rejoice in, does not acclaim, and does not remain attached to the five aggregates, delight ceases; with the cessation of delight, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, life ceases; with the cessation of life, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease. In this way the entire aggregate of suffering is extinguished.

In observing the five aggregates, one must also know as it really is that they all arise from impermanent causes and conditions, and therefore each is impermanent. Form arises from impermanent causes and conditions, so form is impermanent; feeling arises from impermanent causes and conditions, so feeling is impermanent; perception, formations, and consciousness are likewise so. Since all dependently arisen dharmas are impermanent, conditioned, and arise from dependent origination, there is no dharma that can serve as an eternal, unchanging refuge. This is an important basis for the development of disenchantment and dispassion.

VIII.2 The Arising and Cessation of the World and of Suffering  

The arising of the world and the arising of suffering are two aspects of the same causal chain. Dependent on the contact between the six sense faculties and their corresponding six sense objects, consciousness arises; from the combination of faculty, object, and consciousness comes contact; with contact as condition, feeling arises; with feeling as condition, craving arises; with craving as condition, clinging arises; with clinging as condition, existence arises; with existence as condition, birth arises; with birth as condition, aging-and-death and phenomena such as sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair appear. This process is both “the arising of suffering” and “the arising of the world.” When it operates in reverse, it is the cessation of suffering and the cessation of the world: if one develops disenchantment toward the six sense faculties, the six sense objects, and the cognitive process between them, then because of disenchantment there is dispassion; because of dispassion, there is liberation; and in liberation one naturally knows that “clinging” has been completely understood.

VIII.3 Experiential Factors and Their Correspondence to the Arising and Ceasing of Suffering  

Whatever factors constitute experience—their arising, persisting, manifestation, and development—directly bring about the arising and development of suffering, illness, aging, and death. Conversely, whenever any factor that constitutes experience is extinguished and brought to cessation, this directly brings about the extinguishing and cessation of suffering, illness, aging, and death. All experiential factors enumerated above—including the five aggregates, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, formations, and even the four great elements—follow the core principle that “when they arise, suffering arises; when they cease, suffering ceases.” The arising and ceasing of any such factor directly relates to and determines the arising and ceasing of suffering. Therefore, to contemplate the impermanence and dependent origination of these factors is precisely to contemplate how the aggregate of suffering is accumulated and brought to cessation.

IX. The Roots of Suffering, False Theories of Cause, and Modes of Observation  
IX.1 The Roots of Suffering and Clinging (Upadhi)  

In analyzing the various sufferings of the world, one can see that the pains of birth, aging, death, and so on take upadhi (clinging, acquisition, or basis of attachment) as their fundamental cause; and this upadhi itself takes craving as its fundamental cause. Where there is craving, there is upadhi; where there is upadhi, there will inevitably be suffering such as aging-and-death. Thus craving and clinging are key links among the roots of suffering. If craving and clinging are cut off, then future birth and aging-and-death are simultaneously cut off, thereby undermining the very basis of the aggregate of suffering.

IX.2 Refutation of False Theories of the Cause of Suffering  

As mentioned earlier, suffering is neither produced solely by oneself nor solely by others, nor jointly by self and others, nor does it arise without cause. All phenomena of suffering exist according to the law of dependent origination, with contact as the necessary condition for the arising of suffering. If one departs from contact, suffering cannot exist at all. Therefore, views that deny causes and conditions or assert causelessness are all wrong views. Doctrines that claim everything is predetermined by fate, or that all experiences of pleasure and pain are determined by some fixed nature, likewise deviate from the correct principle of dependent origination. The correct stance is to acknowledge that all dharmas arise dependent on preceding conditions—“when this exists, that exists; when this arises, that arises”—and not from no cause, nor from fate.

IX.3 How Modes of Observation Affect the Dependent Chain  

The way in which we observe the phenomena in which we are bound directly determines the direction in which the subsequent dependent chain develops. If we observe with “pleasure-aspect contemplation,” focusing only on what is lovable and desirable in phenomena, craving will increase; when craving increases, clinging, existence, life, and aging-and-death arise in succession, producing the accumulation of the aggregate of suffering. If we observe with contemplation of drawbacks, seeing the impermanence, suffering, and not-self of phenomena and the five aggregates, then craving will tend toward cessation. When craving ceases, clinging, existence, life, and aging-and-death do not arise further, and the aggregate of suffering is extinguished. Thus, the mode of observation itself can serve as an initial cause in this dependent chain, through its influence on the state of craving, and by a chain reaction determines whether all subsequent links of dependent origination arise or cease.

X. Cognitive Processes, Feeling, and the Dependent Origination of Defilements  
X.1 The Cognitive Chain and the Arising of Feeling  

In the cognitive process, the coming together of sense faculty, sense object, and consciousness produces contact; with contact as condition, feeling arises, including pleasant, painful, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling. All feelings arise dependent on specific causes and conditions. Whether wrong view or right view, wrong concentration or right concentration, discursive thought or perception—all of these can serve as conditions for the arising of feeling. The ordinary uninstructed worldling, touched by ignorance, gives rise to feeling; from feeling, craving arises; from craving, further actions and wrong views arise. These actions, cravings, feelings, contacts, and ignorances are all impermanent, conditioned, and dependently arisen; none has any permanent self-nature.

If one develops disenchantment toward each link in the cognitive process—from sense faculty and object to consciousness, contact, and feeling—then because of disenchantment, there is dispassion; because of dispassion, there is liberation. In that very liberation, one naturally knows that “clinging” has been fully understood. This process applies equally to the entire cognitive system of the six sense faculties.

X.2 The Relationship Between Worry and Distress and the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging  

In contemplating the arising of worry and distress, one should carefully investigate from where sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress arise and become manifest. The law of dependent origination points out that the five aggregates subject to clinging are the basis upon which suffering depends. When one gives rise to joy toward the five aggregates subject to clinging, clinging follows; clinging brings future birth; with birth there are aging-and-death and sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress. Conversely, if one does not give rise to joy toward the five aggregates subject to clinging, clinging will not arise; without clinging, there will be no future birth; without birth, aging-and-death and sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress cannot arise. This mode of observation is directly related to how, in practical cultivation, one can end worry, distress, and the aggregate of suffering.

X.3 The Simile of Fire and Fuel  

The law of the life process is like the relationship between a flame and its fuel. For a flame to continue burning, it must rely on fuel; once the fuel is exhausted, the flame naturally goes out. Similarly, the aggregate of suffering and the cycle of birth-and-death must rely on craving, clinging, ignorance, and various karmic formations as their fuel. When these conditions are completely brought to cessation, the aggregate of suffering and the cycle of birth-and-death no longer continue. This simile illustrates the immediacy and inevitability of dependent origination and dependent cessation.

XI. The Noble Disciple’s Penetration, the Wisdom of Dependent Origination, and the Principle of Non-Conceiving  
XI.1 Wisdom-Contemplation of the Noble Principle and Knowledge of the Regularity of the Dhamma  

A noble disciple, using wisdom, correctly contemplates and penetrates the principles understood by the noble ones; one of the core principles is the contemplation of dependent origination. Regarding the arising aspect of dependent origination, one observes: “when that exists, this exists; when that arises, this arises”: dependent on ignorance, formations arise; dependent on formations, consciousness arises; dependent on consciousness, name-and-form arises; dependent on name-and-form, the six sense bases arise; dependent on the six sense bases, contact arises; dependent on contact, feeling arises; dependent on feeling, craving arises; dependent on craving, clinging arises; dependent on clinging, existence arises; dependent on existence, birth arises; dependent on birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. This is the accumulation of all aggregates of suffering. Regarding the aspect of dependent cessation, one observes: “when that does not exist, this does not exist; when that ceases, this ceases”: with the complete and remainderless fading away of ignorance, formations cease; with the cessation of formations, consciousness ceases; with the cessation of consciousness, name-and-form ceases; with the cessation of name-and-form, the six sense bases cease; with the cessation of the six sense bases, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases; with the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease. This is the cessation of all aggregates of suffering.

In the sequence of wisdom, a noble disciple first attains “knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma,” that is, the direct seeing of this entire set of arising and ceasing in dependent origination: knowing and seeing that because of dependent origination there is aging-and-death, and so on back to because of dependent origination there are formations; and likewise knowing and seeing that because of the cessation of dependent origination, aging-and-death cease, and so on back to because of the cessation of dependent origination, formations cease. Only thereafter can one realize the knowledge of nibbāna and personally attain the ultimate liberation in which the aggregate of suffering is exhausted.

XI.2 The Principle of Non-Conceiving and the Empty World  

In realizing dependent origination, the noble disciple also comprehends the principle of the empty world: all the elements that constitute the world, in their very nature, have no “self” or “what belongs to self” as a substantial reality. To avoid once again superimposing views of self upon all dharmas, one must practice the “principle of non-conceiving,” that is, regarding all phenomena, not conceiving them as truly existing in themselves, not conceiving their existence as having inherent nature, not relying on them in one’s conceiving, and not conceiving them as “mine.” Only in this way can one avoid once more establishing grasping and false identification upon dependently arisen dharmas.

XI.3 Ignorance as the Root of Blind Darkness and the Non-Knowledge of the Four Noble Truths  

All the various constitutive elements mentioned above are called “blind darkness” because they cannot be separated from the fundamental pains of birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. Ignorance is precisely the root of this blind darkness; it is the state of lacking correct understanding of the Four Noble Truths: not knowing suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. This not-knowing causes all behavior and cognition to operate accompanied by ignorance, keeping beings in constant forward movement along the chain of dependent origination. Only when such ignorance is thoroughly eradicated, and right knowledge arises with respect to the Four Noble Truths and the twelve links of dependent origination, does one truly set foot on the path to liberation.

XII. Conclusion: The Single Core of the Law of Dependent Origination and the Arising and Ceasing of the Aggregate of Suffering  

In summary, the law of dependent origination explains the universal principle that dharmas arise dependent on specific preceding conditions and cease dependent on specific preceding conditions. Its core sequence of factors is: ignorance, formations, consciousness, name-and-form, the six sense bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, and aging-and-death (or suffering). Each link is both the result of the preceding link and the condition for the subsequent link. Any increase or decrease in one link necessarily brings about a corresponding increase or decrease in the next link. The entire causal chain is constantly governed by the causal law “when this exists, that exists; when this does not exist, that does not exist.” Every link from ignorance to aging-and-death flows and ceases under this very same principle.

The production of suffering is rooted in the chain reaction of contact, feeling, and craving; its cessation is rooted in the complete cutting off and extinguishing of craving. With the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair—all sufferings—cease. In this way, the complete cessation of the aggregate of suffering is realized. The key to liberation lies precisely in directly understanding this causal chain, possessing complete fourfold knowledge of the twelve links of dependent origination, and taking disenchantment, dispassion, and eradication as the core of practice, thereby transforming dependent origination from forward flow to reverse cessation, and ultimately realizing the total extinguishing of the aggregate of suffering.
