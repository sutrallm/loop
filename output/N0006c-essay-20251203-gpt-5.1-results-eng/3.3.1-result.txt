I. Types of Meditators and Basic Evaluation

I.1 Four Types of Meditators

In the practice of samādhi, meditators can be classified according to their degree of mastery over different abilities. If we take two opposing or contrasting abilities as the standard, every meditator can be placed into one of four types: some are skilled only in the first ability but not in the second; some are skilled only in the second but not in the first; some are unskilled in both abilities; and some are able to use both abilities with great skill. Among these four types, those who can skillfully employ both abilities are regarded as the most honored, the supreme, the foremost, the highest, and the most excellent—those who are the most outstanding and most complete achievers in this field.

II. Pairing of Samādhi Abilities and Their Varied Combinations

II.1 Overall Structure of Ability Pairings

In the course of cultivating samādhi, in addition to observing a meditator’s mastery of any single ability on its own, different abilities are also paired two by two, and the differences among meditators within the above four types are observed under each combination of abilities. Based on the different ways of pairing eight samādhi abilities, many sets of ability-combinations are formed. Within each paired set of abilities, four situations can again be distinguished: one type of meditator is skilled in the former ability but not in the latter; a second type is skilled in the latter but not in the former; a third type is unskilled in both; and a fourth type is skillful in both abilities. These four situations occur in the same way within every paired set of abilities.

II.2 Various Pairings Involving “Even-Attainment”

Among all the ability pairings, we first see a whole series of combinations with “Even-Attainment” as one end of the pair. When “Even-Attainment” is paired with “Staying,” four possibilities appear: some are skilled in Even-Attainment but not in Staying; some are skilled in Staying but not in Even-Attainment; some are unskilled in both Even-Attainment and Staying; and some are very skillful in both Even-Attainment and Staying. Likewise, when “Even-Attainment” is paired with “Emergence,” the same four situations exist: skilled in Even-Attainment but not in Emergence; skilled in Emergence but not in Even-Attainment; unskilled in both; and skilled in both.

When “Even-Attainment” is paired with “Pleasure,” it can likewise be observed that some are skilled in Even-Attainment but not in Pleasure; some are skilled in Pleasure but not in Even-Attainment; some are unskilled in both; and some are at ease and proficient in both Even-Attainment and Pleasure. In the same way, when “Even-Attainment” and “Meditation Object” are examined together, the same four situations are seen: skilled in Even-Attainment but not in the Meditation Object; skilled in the Meditation Object but not in Even-Attainment; unskilled in both Even-Attainment and the Meditation Object; and proficient in the use of both.

Further, when “Even-Attainment” is paired with “Field of Activity,” there is again a distinction among: skilled in Even-Attainment but not in the Field of Activity; skilled in the Field of Activity but not in Even-Attainment; unskilled in both; and skilled in both. When “Even-Attainment” is paired with “Arousal,” it is the same: some lean toward strength in Even-Attainment, some toward strength in Arousal, some are weak in both, and some are strong in both. When “Even-Attainment” and “Reverence” are observed together, meditators again display four situations: some emphasize Even-Attainment but are not skilled in Reverence; some are skilled in Reverence but not in Even-Attainment; some are unskilled in both; and some possess skill in both.

Similarly, when “Even-Attainment” is paired with “Constant Practice,” there are again four situations: skilled in Even-Attainment but not in Constant Practice; skilled in Constant Practice but not in Even-Attainment; unskilled in both abilities; and skilled in both. Finally, when “Even-Attainment” is paired with “Accordant Application,” we again see these four different levels of mastery: skilled specifically in Even-Attainment but not in Accordant Application; skilled in Accordant Application but not in Even-Attainment; lacking in both; or complete in both.

II.3 Various Pairings Involving “Staying”

Apart from the many combinations in which it is paired with Even-Attainment, “Staying” itself is also paired with other abilities. When “Staying” and “Emergence” are considered together, a meditator may be skilled in Staying but not in Emergence; skilled in Emergence but not in Staying; unskilled in both; or skillful in both alike. When the pair is changed to “Staying” and “Pleasure,” there again appear cases of being skilled in Staying but not in Pleasure; skilled in Pleasure but not in Staying; unskilled in both; and skilled in both.

If we observe “Staying” in combination with “Meditation Object,” the same four differences are found: some meditators have better mastery of Staying than of the Meditation Object; for some it is the reverse; for some both ends are weak; and for some both ends are strong. When “Staying” is paired with “Field of Activity,” there must again appear the four patterns of being skilled in Staying but not in the Field of Activity; skilled in the Field of Activity but not in Staying; unskilled in both; and skilled in both. Looking at the combination of “Staying” and “Arousal,” meditators may lean toward Staying and not be skilled in Arousal; be skilled in Arousal but not in Staying; find both Staying and Arousal hard to apply; or be well trained in both.

In the pairing of “Staying” and “Reverence,” we likewise see that some practitioners may be rather skilled in Staying yet somewhat deficient in Reverence; some are the opposite, placing emphasis on Reverence while neglecting Staying; some have not achieved either; and some have become skillful in both Staying and Reverence. As for the relationship between “Staying” and “Constant Practice,” it is the same: the four different levels of mastery appear one by one—skilled in Staying but not in Constant Practice; skilled in Constant Practice but not in Staying; unaccomplished at both ends; or complete at both ends. And when “Staying” and “Accordant Application” form a pair, meditators again fall into the same four types: some emphasize Staying but are not skilled in Accordant Application; some emphasize Accordant Application but are not skilled in Staying; some are unskilled in both; and some are skilled in both.

II.4 Various Pairings Involving “Emergence”

Within the system of ability pairings, “Emergence” is also examined in combination with many abilities. When “Emergence” is paired with “Pleasure,” some meditators are skilled in Emergence but not in Pleasure; some are skilled in Pleasure but not in Emergence; some are unskilled in both Emergence and Pleasure; and some are able to master both Emergence and Pleasure fully. When the pairing becomes “Emergence” and “Meditation Object,” the situation is the same: some excel in Emergence but not in the Meditation Object; some excel in the Meditation Object but not in Emergence; some are weak in both; and some are mature in both.

In the pairing of “Emergence” and “Field of Activity,” the same four differences can be observed: skilled in Emergence but not in the Field of Activity; skilled in the Field of Activity but not in Emergence; unskilled in both; and skilled in both. When “Emergence” is combined with “Arousal,” there are meditators who are skilled in Emergence but not in Arousal, and others who are skilled in Arousal but not in Emergence. There are also those who find both Emergence and Arousal hard to apply, and those who have mastered both. When we observe the relationship between “Emergence” and “Reverence,” we again discover that some practitioners are skilled in Emergence but not in Reverence; others are exactly the opposite; some are unskilled at both ends; and some have already attained skill in both Emergence and Reverence.

Looking further at the pairing of “Emergence” and “Constant Practice,” there are again four possible situations: some meditators are relatively superior in Emergence yet weaker in Constant Practice; some are outstanding in Constant Practice but lacking in Emergence; some are unskilled in both; and some are proficient in both. Finally, when “Emergence” is paired with “Accordant Application,” there likewise exist the four levels of mastery: skilled in Emergence but not in Accordant Application; skilled in Accordant Application but not in Emergence; unskilled in both; and skilled in both. Through such multi-layered and multi-combinational ability pairings, the differences in meditators’ abilities in various aspects of samādhi can be presented in a more refined way. In any given pairing, those who are skillful in both abilities are always regarded as the most honored, the supreme, the foremost, the highest, and the most excellent achievers.

III. Higher Pleasures That Surpass Worldly Sensual Enjoyments

III.1 The Pleasure of the Sphere of Infinite Space

Within the sequence of pleasures that surpass worldly sensual enjoyments, there is a state known as “the pleasure of the sphere of infinite space.” To attain this pleasant state, the practitioner must first transcend all perceptions of form—that is, transcend all ideas and images related to the physical body and visible forms. At the same time, he causes perceptions of ill will to cease, no longer allowing any thoughts associated with ill will to remain in his mind, and he ceases thinking many kinds of miscellaneous thoughts, bringing that manifold, scattered mental activity to a stop. Then the mind abides in the state of boundless space and experiences the pleasure of the sphere of infinite space.

III.2 The Pleasure of the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness

With further practice, the practitioner transcends the entire sphere of infinite space, no longer remaining merely in the state of abiding in boundless space, but instead turns toward a deeper experience. After such transcendence, he abides in the sphere of boundless consciousness, dwelling in the sphere of infinite consciousness. In this way there arises the pleasure of the sphere of infinite consciousness, a special ease and joy brought about by experiencing consciousness as measureless and boundless.

III.3 The Pleasure of the Sphere of Nothingness

When the practitioner no longer clings to the pleasure of boundless consciousness manifested in the sphere of infinite consciousness, he further transcends the entire sphere of infinite consciousness. Having transcended all this, the state in which he abides is no longer one of boundless consciousness; instead he dwells in “nothingness,” entering the sphere of nothingness. In this state, the practitioner experiences the pleasure of the sphere of nothingness—the joy of abiding in this mode of “nothing there.”

III.4 The Pleasure of the Sphere of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception

After transcending the sphere of nothingness, the practitioner’s mental processes become even subtler. He transcends the entire sphere of nothingness, no longer stopping at the mere abiding in “nothingness,” but further moves toward an even more subtle state. Having truly gone beyond every sphere of nothingness, he can dwell in the state of “neither-perception-nor-non-perception,” that is, in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Here he receives the pleasure of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a pleasure with extremely subtle and complex characteristics.

III.5 The Pleasure of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling

With renewed effort and refinement, the practitioner further transcends all spheres of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, no longer remaining in the pleasure of that state. When he truly transcends all realms of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he can dwell in “the cessation of perception and feeling,” that is, in a state in which both perception and feeling have ceased. The ease and joy brought about by this state is called the pleasure of the cessation of perception and feeling; within the sequence of pleasures that surpass worldly sensual enjoyment, it is an extremely outstanding and sublime stage.

IV. The State of the Sphere of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception and the Steps of Its Realization

IV.1 The Meaning of the Concentration-State of the Sphere of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception

Among the various pleasant states that transcend worldly sensual pleasures discussed above, the “sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception” is a very crucial concentration-state. This particular state of concentration is reached after the practitioner has transcended the entire sphere of nothingness and, because of its characteristics, it is called “the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.” That is to say, only by truly going beyond all levels of the sphere of nothingness does one enter this special concentration-state.

IV.2 The Process of Realizing the Sphere of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception

In the actual process of realization, the practitioner must at the outset transcend the entire sphere of nothingness. When he truly crosses beyond all the realm of nothingness, he can reach and abide in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Next, if he is able to follow the principle of focused abiding and continue to cultivate in a steady and stable way, he will again transcend all spheres of nothingness. Through this repeated process of transcendence, he can once more reach and abide in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. In this way, the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is not attained only once; rather, on the basis of repeatedly going beyond the sphere of nothingness, it is reached and abided in many times, showing the repetition and deepening inherent in the stages of realization.

IV.3 The Existence of Subtle Mental Activities Within the Concentration-State

Even when the practitioner has already settled in this very subtle concentration-state of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, there may still be certain extremely subtle mental activities present. In particular, there can still be very fine activities connected with “perception” and with the “sphere of nothingness,” which allow mental attention to arise and become manifest. In other words, even in this extremely refined concentration, traces of perception and the subtle influence of the sphere of nothingness may still faintly exist, and through these ultra-subtle activities the functioning of attention appears.

V. The System of Methods for Deep Contemplation in Samādhi

V.1 The Various Gateways of Deep Contemplation in Samādhi

Within the overall system of methods of practice, there is a section specifically devoted to the “gateways of deep contemplation in samādhi.” In this gateway are included many different kinds of samādhi, each serving as a basis for the practitioner’s deep observation and direct cultivation. Among them is the “samādhi with both initial and sustained application of thought,” in which, within samādhi, the activities of both initial application (vitarka) and sustained examination (vicāra) are still present; there is also the “samādhi without initial but with sustained application of thought,” in which the activity of initial application is no longer present, and only the subtler activity of sustained examination remains. Going further, there is the “samādhi without initial or sustained application of thought,” in which both initial and sustained application no longer manifest, and the state of concentration is even more tranquil.

Aside from this classification by the presence or absence of initial and sustained application of thought, the gateways of deep contemplation in samādhi also list the “emptiness samādhi,” the “signless samādhi,” and the “wishless samādhi.” The emptiness samādhi is the samādhi corresponding to “emptiness,” the signless samādhi corresponds to “signlessness,” and the wishless samādhi corresponds to “wishlessness.” Each of these samādhis forms an independent pathway of deep contemplation, enabling practitioners to, through different styles of samādhi, deeply experience and examine the distinctions among mental activities and meditative states.

VI. Fundamental Principles and Illustrations of Accomplishment in Practice

VI.1 Explaining the Sequence of Practice with the Image of a Snow Mountain and an Elephant

Within the fundamental principles of accomplishment in practice, there is a vivid illustration that helps in understanding the sequence and relationships of reliance in the process of cultivation. Just as a snow mountain can nourish elephants, causing their bodies and strength to gradually grow until they are eventually able to adapt to the environment of the vast ocean, in the same way the elephants’ ability to adapt to that great ocean must first rely on the long-term nourishment and fostering provided by the snow mountain. For practitioners, the principle is the same: they too must rely on a solid foundation, allowing their basic conditions to grow and become firm step by step. Only with the support of such a stable foundation can practitioners cultivate gradually, one step at a time, and in the end accomplish vast merits, rather than attempting to complete everything in one single effort. This illustration reminds us that practice must be carried out in a gradual sequence, relying on a solid basis, in order to truly reach perfect accomplishment and great virtue.
