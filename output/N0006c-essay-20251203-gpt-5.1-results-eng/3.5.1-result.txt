<title> Stream-entry and the Noble Disciples’ Path of Liberation </title>
<article>
I. Perfect Right View and the Gate of Liberation

When a practitioner arrives at complete knowing, they are said to be endowed with right view and to have penetrated the True Dhamma; they are one who has truly entered the stream of the Dhamma. Possessing noble and lucid wisdom, they symbolize the ripening of inner awareness and have opened for themselves the gate of liberation. This state is not merely an intellectual grasp of doctrine, but the whole orientation of their life has come into accord with liberation.

In their practice, if a noble disciple possesses three specific conditions, they can clearly know for themselves that they have realized the fruit of stream-entry. Although these three conditions are not set out one by one here, as long as they are truly and fully present, the practitioner can confirm that they have escaped the suffering of the hell, animal, and hungry-ghost realms, are no longer drawn into these woeful destinies, and, in the long flow of life, have decisively set out toward final awakening. When such attainment appears, the noble disciple has not only entered the stream of the Dhamma but is already standing at the threshold of the Deathless, that is, at the great gate leading to the unborn, unceasing state.

II. Direct Knowledge and the Achievement of Stream-entry

The attainment of stream-entry is founded upon seeing things as they really are. Because a noble disciple directly knows the arising of the five aggregates subject to clinging, their cessation, the gratification within them, the danger hidden in them, and the way of transcendence and escape from them, they gain the assurance of non-retrogression in practice. This direct knowledge prevents them from falling away from the noble path; they will inevitably move toward awakening and will no longer be lost in the speculations and grasping bound up with the aggregates.

Likewise, it is the same with the five spiritual faculties. When a noble disciple directly knows the arising of these five faculties, their cessation, the gratification they bring, the danger within them, and the method of escape, they are called a stream-enterer. Such a noble disciple is said to possess the quality of “non-fallenness,” meaning they will no longer fall into woeful destinies or into corrupt states, and are decisively headed toward equal awakening—moving toward an enlightenment equal to that of the Fully Awakened Ones.

III. Cutting Off Doubt, Stream-entry, and Non-fall into Lower Realms

On the path leading to stream-entry, “cutting off doubt” is an extremely crucial core element. A noble disciple first utterly eliminates doubt concerning the six bases—that is, the five aggregates and their objects of cognition; they no longer harbor uncertainty about the nature, function, or reality of these six bases. At the same time, they completely cut off doubt regarding suffering as a fact, the arising of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path that leads in accordance with the cessation of suffering—that is, the way that leads to the ending of suffering.

When a noble disciple can cut off doubt with respect to these six bases, and also with respect to the truth of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path that leads to its cessation, they are called a noble one who has obtained the fruit of stream-entry. From another angle, regarding all phenomena that arise through the six sense bases, regarding the nature of suffering, the causes for its arising, the state of its cessation, and the path of practice leading to that cessation, they are no longer shaken or confused. Such a noble disciple who has cut off doubt is not only nominally a stream-enterer; they have actually obtained the Dhamma of non-retrogression and are decisively bound for right awakening.

Such attainment means they have completely escaped the law by which one falls into lower realms; they are no longer drawn into the hell, animal, hungry-ghost, or any woeful destinies, and there is no longer any possibility of falling into the lower realms. What they possess is a clear, firm, and irreversible orientation; thus they are said to possess the Dhamma of non-fall, decisively headed toward unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment, progressing toward the ultimate awakening of complete Buddhahood.

IV. Followers-by-Faith, Followers-by-Dhamma, and Entering Stream-entry

Prior to realizing the fruit of stream-entry there is a crucial stage of practice, namely the attainment of the “follower-by-faith” and the “follower-by-Dhamma.” When a practitioner, regarding the law of impermanence explained earlier, either develops conviction and understanding through faith, or arrives at appreciation through careful, wise reflection and observation, they gradually establish the foundation of their practice. As long as they give rise to genuine confidence and understanding in these laws of impermanence, or arrive at firm comprehension through the wisdom of investigation, they are said to have entered the “fixed rightness” and the “plane of the noble ones,” having gone beyond the ordinary worldling’s plane.

At this stage, although the karmic forces they have created still continue to operate, these will no longer lead to rebirth in the three lower destinies of hell, animals, or hungry ghosts. In other words, although they have not yet personally realized the fruit of stream-entry, as long as they maintain such fixed rightness and remain on the noble plane, they will not pass away before attaining stream-entry; the course of their life will certainly lead to deeper realization.

When a practitioner no longer relates to the above laws of impermanence merely through faith and reflection but gains direct seeing and realization, then the noble fruit of stream-entry appears. That is, when they develop experiential realization of the principle that all conditioned formations are impermanent, they fulfill the conditions for attaining the fruit of stream-entry. At that point they are truly called a stream-enterer, possessing the Dhamma of non-retrogression and definitely heading toward right awakening.

V. The Four Dhammas, the Four Factors of Stream-entry, and Their Relation to the Noble Eightfold Path

The realization of stream-entry is often established through four specific Dhammas and the four factors of stream-entry. When a noble disciple fulfills these four Dhammas, they are called a noble stream-enterer, having escaped the lower realms and decisively moving toward final awakening. These four Dhammas do not concern merely one aspect such as faith or moral discipline; rather, they serve as the fundamental basis of overall practice. As long as one possesses these four Dhammas and practices in accordance with them, one can receive the Blessed One’s confirmation and be acknowledged as one who has entered the stream of the noble ones.

Elsewhere it is taught that if a noble disciple perfectly accomplishes four essential Dhammas, they thereby realize the fruit of stream-entry. This fruit means that they have transcended the lower realms; the direction of their life is no longer vague, but has turned decisively toward awakening. Once they possess these four Dhammas, they are immediately designated as a noble one at the fruit of stream-entry; they will never again fall into the lower realms and are certainly bound for right awakening.

At the same time, another teaching states that, by abandoning four faults and accomplishing four virtues, a practitioner is recognized as one who has attained the fruit of stream-entry. When they have completely eliminated these four faults and fully realized these four virtues, they truly obtain the fruit of stream-entry. Such beings have already escaped all downfall; they have left behind the lower realms and unwholesome states, and are decisively headed toward final awakening, inevitably progressing to complete enlightenment.

Emphasized alongside these four Dhammas are the four factors of stream-entry. These four factors are regarded as the foundational conditions for realizing the fruit of stream-entry and as the starting point of the entire system of the noble path. Basing themselves on these four factors of stream-entry, practitioners should then further cultivate the six Dhammas that are in accordance with true knowledge. When these methods are all fully cultivated, they can cut off the five lower fetters, be spontaneously reborn, realize Nibbāna there, and attain the fruit of non-return.

In the inner structure of the path of practice, the factors of stream-entry are regarded as the basic conditions for realizing the noble path, while the Noble Eightfold Path is its concrete content of practice. When a practitioner fully implements the Noble Eightfold Path, taking the four factors of stream-entry as their preliminary supports, they can truly realize the fruit of stream-entry. Thus some discourses state explicitly: one who accomplishes the Noble Eightfold Path is a stream-enterer; and there is also another group of practitioners, identified by specific names and lineages, who are likewise recognized as stream-enterers.

Because the four factors of stream-entry are so vital, a noble disciple should not only practice them personally but also actively encourage their relatives and friends for whom they care to cultivate these four factors. For such relatives and friends, by practicing in accordance with these factors, they too have the opportunity to step onto the path of stream-entry and walk the road to liberation. When a noble disciple has fulfilled these four Dhammas, they realize the fruit of stream-entry, have escaped unwholesome and degenerating states, and are decisively heading toward final awakening.

VI. Purifying Faith, Noble Virtue, and the Meaning of Stream-entry

In the causal conditions for realizing the fruit of stream-entry, purified faith in the Triple Gem and the moral discipline loved by the noble ones occupy a central place. There is a class of beings who realize the fruit of stream-entry by accomplishing “three kinds of purified faith,” namely unwavering and pure confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Through such purified faith they reach the extinction of the factors leading to downfall; all states that cause degeneration are eliminated, and their mind establishes a firm resolution to move toward equal awakening, advancing toward an enlightenment equal to that of the Great Awakened One.

There is another class of beings who realize the fruit of stream-entry through accomplishing noble moral discipline. Such noble virtue consists of precepts cherished by the noble ones, characterized by flawless purity of conduct—unbroken, untorn, unspotted, unblemished; free from defilement and liberating; praised by the wise; and not clung to. This type of moral discipline can give rise to samādhi and bring the mind to settled concentration. On the basis of realizing such noble virtue, they likewise bring about the extinction of the factors leading to downfall and obtain a firm resolve toward equal awakening.

In more detailed explanations, the fruit of stream-entry is defined as having entered the stream of the noble path, destined to reach Nibbāna, no longer subject to falling back into woeful destinies. To attain this fruit, one must possess purified faith in the Triple Gem and the moral discipline cherished by the noble ones. Purified faith in the Buddha means being convinced that the Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One. Purified faith in the true Dhamma means deep confidence that the teaching expounded by the Blessed One is genuine and infallible and can lead to liberation. Purified faith in the Saṅgha means being convinced that the community of noble disciples is composed of those who practice well, practice straight, practice methodically, and practice properly; that it is the community of noble ones comprising the four pairs, the eight kinds of individuals, worthy of offerings, hospitality, gifts, and reverential salutation—the unsurpassed field of merit in the world.

When a noble disciple has fully accomplished purified faith in these three aspects and has also realized the moral discipline cherished by the noble ones—precepts that are pure and flawless, unbroken, untorn, unspotted, unblemished, liberating, praised by the wise, and not clung to, and that can give rise to samādhi—then they have fulfilled the core conditions for realizing the fruit of stream-entry. In the progressive order of the path to liberation, if a noble disciple has firm faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha but has not yet attained “quick wisdom” or “swift wisdom,” the two types of rapid, incisive discernment, as long as they have already completely cut off the three fetters, they can likewise attain the fruit of stream-entry and are decisively bound for equal awakening.

VII. The Cessation of Fear, Self-confirmation, and the Ending of Woeful Destinies

As the noble disciple continues to exert themselves in practice, with the fulfillment of the four factors of stream-entry together with purified faith and noble virtue, they also gain liberation from inner fear. Such a noble disciple has brought to an end five kinds of fear and enmity; they are no longer dominated by internal or external foes and terrors. At the same time, they have completed the four factors of stream-entry and, by wisdom, contemplate the noble truths and truly penetrate them, thereby gaining a thorough insight into the reality of liberation.

On this basis, the noble disciple can make a self-confirmation through the “Dhamma-mirror” teaching. When they wish to examine themselves, they will observe and confirm in accordance with reality that the hell realm, the animal realm, and the hungry-ghost realm have come to an end, and that all evil births, woeful destinies, and places of downfall have been cut off. Thus they can clearly declare that they have attained the fruit of stream-entry, are decisively moving toward right awakening, will never retreat, have already departed from all downfall, and have reached a firm resolution toward equal awakening.

When a lay follower (upāsaka) passes away, if they have already attained the first fruit—that is, the fruit of stream-entry—their attainment becomes manifest in a clear way. Such a lay follower, at the time of death, has cut off the three fetters and has become a true stream-enterer. Thereafter, they will definitely not turn back; they are assuredly bound for right awakening, and the direction of their life is irreversibly set toward enlightenment.

To sum up, a noble disciple who has realized the fruit of stream-entry does so by perfecting right understanding; by directly contemplating the five aggregates subject to clinging and the five spiritual faculties; by cutting off all doubt about the six bases and the Four Noble Truths; and by steadily establishing a firm foundation of non-retrogression and freedom from the lower realms through the four Dhammas, the four factors of stream-entry, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the practice of purified faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha together with the moral discipline cherished by the noble ones. When they have brought fear and enmity to an end, contemplate and penetrate the noble truths with wisdom, and can, through the Dhamma-mirror teaching, confirm for themselves the ending of woeful destinies, then they truly become a noble stream-enterer—one who has entered the stream of the noble path, destined to reach Nibbāna and final, complete awakening.
