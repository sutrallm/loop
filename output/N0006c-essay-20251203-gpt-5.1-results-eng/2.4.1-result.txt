<article>
I. The Status of the Concentration of Mindfulness of Breathing and Its Overall Benefits  

I.1 The Excellent Path Abided in by the Noble Ones  
Mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and the concentration of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing are a fundamental path of practice that takes the breath as its core. This concentration is honorably described as the domain in which the noble ones, the brahma-farers, and the Tathāgata abide. It is the excellent concentration in which the noble ones dwell, and the stable realm on which brahma-farers rely to live a pure life.  

If a practitioner can focus and continuously cultivate mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and the corresponding concentration, one is not merely training an ordinary skill of attention, but is in fact drawing near to the path trodden by the noble ones and abiding in the stillness realized by the Tathāgata.  

I.2 Great Results and Great Merit  
The scriptures repeatedly emphasize that, so long as one practices and practices much this path of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, and continually puts it into practice, it will bring great results and great merit. Through repeated cultivation and frequent practice of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, one can obtain vast and excellent fruits and merits.  

By focusing on and continuously cultivating the concentration of mindfulness of breathing, the body will no longer sway, and the mind will no longer waver; body and mind both become stable and unmoving. Because body and mind tend toward stability, the practitioner can obtain concentration at will, without feeling difficulty or obstruction, and can naturally enter a state that is peaceful, sublime, undefiled, and pleasant to abide in.  

When unwholesome and unskillful states arise in the mind, because of such concentration and right mindfulness, they can be quickly eliminated and thus the defilements are unable to grow.  

I.3 Four Fundamental Benefits and Seven Types of Results  
The cultivation of the concentration of mindfulness of breathing can bring four fundamental benefits. Through correct method and sustained practice, it can help the practitioner cut off defilements, eradicate latent tendencies once and for all, thoroughly understand the course of life, and ultimately exhaust all the taints.  

To accomplish these four fundamental benefits, the practitioner should follow the sequential methods of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and its concentration, and make this an ongoing practice. As long as one can practice according to the teaching, and through sustained cultivation and implementation of the methods described above, these four fundamental benefits will gradually manifest.  

In addition to these four fundamental benefits, correct cultivation of mindfulness of breathing also brings seven foreseeable results and merits. Among them are attainment in this very life: awakening and realization in one’s present existence; and attainment at the time of death: if awakening has not occurred during life, one may attain realization at life’s end.  

Furthermore, if at the time of death one has still not awakened but has completely cut off the five lower fetters, one can realize Nibbāna of the complete destruction of the five fetters and the higher fruits, that is, possibly attain Nibbāna in-between (antarā-parinibbāna), Nibbāna upon landing (upahacca-parinibbāna), Nibbāna without exertion (asaṅkhāra-parinibbāna), Nibbāna with exertion (sasaṅkhāra-parinibbāna), or be reborn and rise to the Highest Form Realm (the Peak of the Form Realm).  

From this it is clear that as long as one continuously practices and repeatedly cultivates mindfulness of breathing, one can obtain extremely excellent benefits—whether in the present life, at the time of death, or in one’s future destination.  

II. Attitude, Purpose of Practice, and Day-and-Night Mindfulness  

II.1 Fundamental Motivation and Resolution for Practice  
Before actual practice, the practitioner should first adjust attitude and establish the right intention. One should withdraw to a secluded and quiet place, far from noise and disturbances, sit upright with the body straight and stable.  

On this basis, one arouses a clear and firm resolution for practice, understanding that one is cultivating in order to subdue craving and distress regarding the world, and that the purpose is to cut off defilements, not to chase after new pleasures.  

In practice one should possess ardor, clear comprehension, and right mindfulness. Ardor means being unremitting and not negligent; clear comprehension means maintaining a lucid understanding of one’s present bodily and mental state; right mindfulness means not letting the mind lose its object, but continually remembering what one is doing right now.  

The practitioner should also deliberately calm the mental activities of initial and sustained application of thought—namely, cease scattered discrimination and stray imagination—allowing the mind to gradually leave coarse thinking and turn toward focusing on a single object. When the mind is focused on one object, inner stillness is established, laying a stable foundation for the arising of the concentration of mindfulness of breathing.  

II.2 Daily and Nightly Practice Schedule  
For the sake of present ease and happiness and ultimate liberation, the practitioner should also establish a clear schedule of practice throughout the day and night. During the daytime, as well as during the first and last watches of the night, one should practice through walking meditation and sitting meditation, using walking and sitting to continually contemplate the breath, purifying the mind of obstructive qualities and thereby reducing and eliminating various unwholesome and unskillful states.  

In the middle watch of the night, the practitioner may temporarily stop walking and sitting meditation and lie down to rest on the right side in the “lion’s posture.” Even before sleep, one should maintain right mindfulness and clear comprehension, clearly setting the intention to rise at a certain time when lying down, not allowing sleep to become negligence, but making sleep itself part of the practice.  

In this way, throughout a twenty-four-hour day—from daytime through the three watches of the night—there is appropriate practice and mindfulness in place, and cultivation can proceed steadily and without interruption.  

III. Practice Environment and Preparation of Body and Mind  

III.1 Choosing a Quiet Place  
The cultivation of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and its concentration requires a suitable environment for support. The practitioner should go to a quiet place, away from crowds and noise. For example, one may choose a remote and secluded forest dwelling (ārañña), that is, a lonely and quiet mountain grove; or enter mountainous areas, forests, groves, woodlands, and find a quiet corner in nature; or abide under a tree, at a tree root, in an empty building, or a vacant dwelling.  

Whether it is a mountain forest, forest, grove, woodland, secluded place, under a tree, or in an empty or unused dwelling, their common feature is quietness and lack of disturbance, suitable for gathering body and mind.  

When the practitioner withdraws to such a secluded place, external visual and auditory stimulation decreases, and the mind is more easily collected. Such a silent environment both fulfills the requirement of “withdrawing to a secluded place” and allows the practitioner to focus more fully on the breath, gradually leaving off clinging and grasping to the various worldly objects, and truly bringing the mind back to inner contemplation.  

III.2 Adjusting the Posture and Establishing Mindfulness  
After selecting a suitable quiet place, the practitioner should sit upright and adjust body and mind. As to posture, one may sit cross-legged or in full lotus, placing the legs in a stable position, allowing the body to settle naturally and unmoving. Whether one “sits upright cross-legged” or “sits in full lotus,” the key is to keep the body straight—neither leaning nor slanting—neither stiff and tense, nor slack and hunched, but “sitting upright at ease,” stable and comfortable.  

After adjusting the posture, one should “establish awareness in the present moment,” that is, place the mind in the present, not allowing it to fall into memories of the past or imaginations of the future. The practitioner should establish mindfulness here-and-now, or “establish mindfulness in front,” so that the mind clearly knows that one is sitting here, ready to take the breath as the meditation object.  

At the same time, one should possess clear awareness and clear comprehension, maintaining lucid knowing of inhalation, exhalation, bodily sensations, and changes in the mind. In this way, with the body upright and stable and the mind settled in the present, the basic conditions for cultivating mindfulness of breathing and its concentration are fulfilled.  

IV. Core Method of the Concentration of Mindfulness of Breathing and the Sixteen-Step Practice  

IV.1 Mindful Breathing and Knowing Long and Short Breaths  
The core of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and its concentration is to take the breath as the object of contemplation. After sitting upright, the practitioner first uses continuous right mindfulness to know the inhalation and exhalation of the breath. Whenever inhaling, one clearly knows that one is inhaling; whenever exhaling, one clearly knows that one is exhaling.  

This “mindfully breathing in, mindfully breathing out,” or “maintaining mindfulness of the sensation of air entering and leaving,” “maintaining awareness while breathing in and out,” is the foundation of the entire practice.  

On this basis, the practitioner further knows the length of the breath. When breathing in long, one clearly knows that one is breathing in long; when breathing out long, one clearly knows that one is breathing out long. When breathing in short, one clearly knows that one is breathing in short; when breathing out short, one clearly knows that one is breathing out short.  

In other words, when the inhalation is long, one knows it is long; when the exhalation is long, one knows it is long; when the inhalation is short, one knows it is short; when the exhalation is short, one knows it is short. Through such awareness, the practitioner no longer treats the breath as a vague background, but can accurately know the difference between “long inhalation, long exhalation, short inhalation, short exhalation,” maintaining clear awareness of the subtle changes of the breath.  

This awareness of the breath’s length constitutes the first four of the sixteen steps, and is the basis for deeper contemplation to follow. At this stage, the practitioner is still only knowing the state of the breath as it is, without deliberately manipulating it, simply “attentively observing the process of breathing—inhalation, exhalation, long breaths, short breaths and their details”—allowing mindfulness to follow the breath naturally.  

IV.2 Knowing the Whole Body and Calming the Bodily Formation  
When the breath’s length is clearly known, the practitioner proceeds to the next level: knowing the whole body while breathing. One trains to know the whole body when breathing in, and to know the whole body when breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body’; ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.’”  

Here “the whole body” can refer to the entire process of the breath’s activity throughout the body, or to the whole-body sensation experienced during breathing. As one breathes in and out, one experiences bodily sensations in the whole body, knowing the entire bodily process of breathing—not only paying attention to a small area such as the nostrils or chest or abdomen, but allowing awareness to pervade the whole body.  

After this, the practitioner further trains to calm the bodily formation while breathing in, and to calm the bodily formation while breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in calming the bodily formation’; ‘I shall breathe out calming the bodily formation.’”  

During inhalation and exhalation, one deliberately allows the various bodily activities to grow quiet, making the breath gentle, the body stable, and the entire breathing process increasingly calm. This practice can calm the body, so that the body no longer sways, and thereby achieve the stability of both body and mind.  

When the practitioner “experiences the whole breathing process” and “calms the whole breathing process,” the bodily formation gradually settles, the breath becomes subtle and no longer coarse. In this way, the concentration of mindfulness of breathing gradually becomes established, and the body naturally takes on the characteristic of not swaying, the sitting posture stable like a mountain. This completes the fifth and sixth of the sixteen steps and provides a stable physical and mental basis for the subtler contemplation of the mind.  

IV.3 Experiencing Rapture and Happiness  
After the bodily formation has been calmed, practice gradually shifts from body to feeling—that is, from bodily tranquility to the arising of mental rapture and happiness. The practitioner trains to experience rapture while breathing in and to experience rapture while breathing out; likewise, to experience happiness while breathing in and to experience happiness while breathing out.  

That is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing rapture’; ‘I shall breathe out experiencing rapture’”; and “I shall breathe in experiencing happiness; I shall breathe out experiencing happiness.”  

In actual fact, as concentration gradually becomes established, the practitioner will experience the rapture and happiness brought about by concentration in the midst of inhalation and exhalation. One experiences rapture while inhaling and also while exhaling; one experiences happiness while inhaling and also while exhaling.  

This rapture and happiness are inner experiences within concentration, not the result of external stimulation, but the pure enjoyment that naturally arises from the stillness of body and mind and the settling of right mindfulness.  

At this stage, the practitioner also trains to allow the mind to feel rapture and peace while breathing, and to be free from bondage to that rapture and happiness, not being tied by pleasant feeling. In other words, although one indeed experiences rapture and happiness in concentration, one does not give rise to new attachment to these feelings, but instead clearly knows their arising and passing away and contemplates them as they are, without being drawn along.  

Such practice completes the seventh and eighth of the sixteen steps, purifying the realm of feeling and opening the way to contemplation of the mental formations.  

IV.4 Knowing the Mental Formation and Calming the Mental Formation  
After experiencing and knowing rapture and happiness, the practice goes deeper into the “mental formation,” that is, the various activities of the mind. The practitioner trains to know the mental formation while breathing in and to know the mental formation while breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation’; ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation.’”  

While inhaling and exhaling, one is aware of mental activity, knowing whether the mind is scattered or collected, dull or clear, joyful or neutral, maintaining right understanding and right mindfulness of all mental states.  

When the practitioner already has clear awareness of the mental formation, one then trains to calm the mental formation while breathing in, and to calm the mental formation while breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in calming the mental formation’; ‘I shall breathe out calming the mental formation.’”  

While breathing in and out, the practitioner strives to let the various mental activities gradually grow quiet, allowing the restless and anxious mental formations to settle, so that the mind no longer rises and falls with external conditions, but tends toward peace and stability.  

In this process, the practitioner simultaneously experiences the calm of the mental formation and, throughout breathing, experiences and knows how the mind moves from restlessness to stillness. In this way, mental formations are no longer agitated; the inner mind becomes composed and stable. This completes the ninth through twelfth steps and prepares for a more direct “knowing of the mind.”  

IV.5 Knowing the Mind, Gladdening the Mind, Concentrating and Liberating the Mind  
After the mental formation has been calmed, the practice turns to directly contemplating “the mind” itself. The practitioner trains to know the mind while breathing in and to know the mind while breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the mind’; ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the mind.’”  

While inhaling and exhaling, one knows the mind’s feelings and states: whether the mind is collected or scattered, clear or murky, soft or rigid, increasing in faith or weakening in faith, and so on. Throughout the breathing process, one also experiences and knows the mind’s tranquil and liberated states—knowing how the mind abides and opens in concentration.  

On this basis, the practitioner further trains to gladden the mind while breathing in and to gladden the mind while breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in gladdening the mind’; ‘I shall breathe out gladdening the mind.’”  

In inhalation and exhalation, one allows the state of mind to be joyful, making the mind happy, filling it with pure joy and peace. Moreover, as one experiences joy and peace, one is free from bondage to these states and is no longer constrained by joy itself. Here “joy” is not worldly merriment, but the mental happiness that arises from purity in concentration.  

Next, the practitioner trains to concentrate the mind while breathing in and to concentrate the mind while breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in concentrating the mind’; ‘I shall breathe out concentrating the mind.’”  

“Concentrating” (establishing “evenness of mind”) means letting the mind settle on a single object, focused and not scattered. While breathing in and out, the mind no longer drifts with external conditions, but is steadily established on the breath and the meditation object. Through such practice, mental focus and concentration grow continuously.  

Finally, the practitioner trains to liberate the mind while breathing in and to liberate the mind while breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in liberating the mind’; ‘I shall breathe out liberating the mind.’”  

This liberation is manifested in not being bound by greed, hatred, and delusion in the present moment, and also in not being entangled in various mental states. While breathing in and out, one allows the mind to be joyful and concentrated, and yet liberated from these very states; throughout the breathing process, one experiences and knows the mind’s liberated condition, seeing how it gradually loosens from former habits and defilements.  

Such practice completes the thirteenth and fourteenth steps, allowing the mind to be gradually perfected in joy, concentration, and liberation.  

IV.6 Contemplating Impermanence, Dispassion, Cessation, and Letting Go  
When the mind is already joyful, concentrated, and has tasted liberation, the practitioner enters the final four and most wisdom-oriented steps of the sixteen.  

First, one contemplates impermanence while breathing in and while breathing out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating impermanence’; ‘I shall breathe out contemplating impermanence.’”  

While inhaling and exhaling, one observes the nature of all bodily and mental phenomena as flowing and changing, contemplates the nature of impermanence, and understands that the breath itself is also arising and ceasing, not abiding.  

Next, one contemplates dispassion while breathing in and out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating dispassion (fading of desire)’; ‘I shall breathe out contemplating dispassion.’”  

While breathing in and out, one observes the process of dispassion, understanding how attachment and craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are gradually weakened and abandoned under the power of right mindfulness and wisdom. At this time, one is not only subduing gross desires, but truly experiencing, between breaths, the coolness of being far removed from sense craving.  

Then, one contemplates cessation while breathing in and out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating cessation’; ‘I shall breathe out contemplating cessation.’”  

While inhaling and exhaling, one observes the process of quiescence and cessation—understanding the decline and ceasing of conditioned phenomena, and experiencing the stopping of defilements and suffering. Here “cessation” and “quiescence” refer to the stopping of defilements and clinging, not mere blankness, but a wise awareness of how blazing defilements are extinguished.  

Finally, one contemplates relinquishment and letting go while breathing in and out; that is, “one trains oneself: ‘I shall breathe in contemplating relinquishment’; ‘I shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment.’”  

While inhaling and exhaling, one observes the process of letting go—learning to imaginatively see and actually observe relinquishment, observe discarding, up to letting go even of attachment to the breath itself. This is not only relinquishing attachment to the breath, but using contemplation of the breath as a means to further relinquish all clinging to body, mind, and phenomena.  

During breathing, one observes and knows the impermanent nature of all phenomena and the relinquishment of all attachment, truly experiencing the coolness and freedom that letting go brings.  

Taken together, these sixteen steps proceed from knowing the length of the breath, to knowing the whole body and calming the bodily formation, then to experiencing rapture and happiness, further to knowing and calming the mental formation, then to knowing the mind, gladdening it, concentrating it, and liberating it, and finally to contemplating impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment.  

This is the sixteen-step practice of the concentration of mindfulness of breathing, encompassing contemplation of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena, and uniting the fullness of concentration and wisdom.  

V. Extensive and Complete Practice of the Concentration of Mindfulness of Breathing and Its Progressive Stages  

V.1 The Extensive and Complete Sixteen-Step Contemplation  
When the sixteen steps described above can be practiced in sequence, one accomplishes the extensive and complete method of mindfulness of breathing. This extensive and complete practice unfolds fully as a sixteen-step contemplation.  

On the basis of mindful inhalation and mindful exhalation, the practitioner knows long inhalation and long exhalation, and knows short inhalation and short exhalation; then trains to breathe in experiencing the whole body and to breathe out experiencing the whole body; and further, to breathe in calming the bodily formation and to breathe out calming the bodily formation.  

Subsequently, one trains to breathe in experiencing rapture and to breathe out experiencing rapture; to breathe in experiencing happiness and to breathe out experiencing happiness.  

After that, the practitioner trains to breathe in experiencing the mental formation and to breathe out experiencing the mental formation; to breathe in calming the mental formation and to breathe out calming the mental formation; then to breathe in experiencing the mind and to breathe out experiencing the mind; and further, to breathe in gladdening the mind and to breathe out gladdening the mind; to breathe in concentrating the mind and to breathe out concentrating the mind; to breathe in liberating the mind and to breathe out liberating the mind.  

Finally, one trains to breathe in contemplating impermanence and to breathe out contemplating impermanence; to breathe in contemplating dispassion and to breathe out contemplating dispassion; to breathe in contemplating cessation and to breathe out contemplating cessation; and to breathe in contemplating relinquishment and to breathe out contemplating relinquishment.  

The entire sixteen-step contemplation connects step by step, proceeds in proper sequence, and completely presents the entire content from body to wisdom and from concentration to liberation.  

V.2 Continuous and Deepening Practice: From One Dharma to Four Dharmas  
To truly accomplish the four fundamental benefits mentioned earlier, the practitioner must “practice and practice much” mindfulness of breathing and its concentration, rather than engaging in it only occasionally. That is, one must focus and continuously cultivate, through repeated implementation and frequent training, so that the sixteen steps become increasingly familiar and natural in daily life.  

When one practices and practices much this concentration, not only does the body not sway and the mind not waver, but any unwholesome and unskillful states that arise can be quickly eliminated by the power of concentration and wisdom. Through such long-term cultivation, one can truly realize the benefits of peace, sublimity, purity, and pleasant abiding that the concentration of mindfulness of breathing brings.  

In the progressive stages of realization, the concentration of mindfulness of breathing is regarded as a fundamental path of practice, focusing on the in-and-out breath. Through continuous cultivation and deepening practice, this method can lay the foundation for the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.  

That is, in the complete sequence of realization, in the first stage, the single method practiced is precisely the concentration of mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, and from this one method, the four methods—the Four Establishments of Mindfulness—are fulfilled. From one method, four methods are perfected, so that mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena are all established on the basis of the concentration of mindfulness of breathing.  

Therefore, the concentration of mindfulness of breathing is both an independent and complete method of concentration and an important bridge leading to the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and ultimately to liberation.  

To achieve the four fundamental benefits and the vast and excellent results mentioned above, the practitioner should follow this whole system of the concentration of mindfulness of breathing—from mindful breathing and knowing long and short breaths, all the way to contemplating impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment—cultivating step by step. When these methods are cultivated for a long time, the practitioner can experience the cutting off of defilements, the eradication of latent tendencies, the thorough understanding of the life process, and the exhaustion of all taints.  

VI. Attainments of Different Practitioners in the Concentration of Mindfulness of Breathing  

VI.1 Orientation for Learners (Those Still in Training)  
For learners—those who have not yet realized ultimate liberation—the concentration of mindfulness of breathing is a reliable and gradual path. Through the environmental choices, bodily and mental preparations, sixteen-step practice, and day-and-night mindfulness described above, a learner can gradually subdue craving and distress regarding the world.  

By continually cultivating this concentration, not only can unwholesome and unskillful states be quickly eliminated as soon as they arise, but through the training of wisdom in contemplating impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment, all defilements gradually weaken and are finally utterly extinguished.  

Such practice allows learners to draw ever nearer to Nibbāna, to the point that they may, among the seven types of results, either awaken in this life or at the time of death, or, having already cut off the five lower fetters, realize Nibbāna in-between, upon landing, without exertion, with exertion, or be reborn and ascend to the Highest Form Realm.  

VI.2 The Peace of the Arahants (Those Beyond Training)  
For those who have realized arahantship and are beyond training, the concentration of mindfulness of breathing also has great significance. Although they have already utterly extinguished defilements, by continually cultivating this concentration they can still obtain a peaceful life in their remaining existence.  

The concentration of mindfulness of breathing allows them to maintain clear right mindfulness and awareness in daily walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, so that body and mind abide constantly in a state of peace, sublimity, purity, and pleasant abiding.  

Even though they no longer need to practice for the sake of liberation, since this concentration is the domain in which the noble ones, brahma-farers, and the Tathāgata abide, the arahants still delight in dwelling in this concentration, taking it as the support for a present life of peace and clarity.  

VI.3 Integration of Present-Life Happiness and Ultimate Liberation  
Mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and its concentration not only bring present-life happiness but also lead to ultimate liberation. Through walking and sitting practice during the day and the first and last watches of the night, the practitioner purifies the mind of obstructive qualities so that defilements decrease day by day.  

At the middle watch of the night, when lying down to rest in the lion’s posture, one still maintains right mindfulness, clear comprehension, and the intention to rise, allowing the three watches of the night and the daytime all to become arenas of practice.  

Through such a life arrangement and the joint cultivation of concentration and wisdom, the practitioner can not only attain in this life a state of peace, sublimity, purity, and pleasant abiding, but also immediately eliminate unwholesome and unskillful states when they arise.  

Through long-term cultivation and repeated practice, mindfulness of in-and-out breathing and its concentration not only bring great results and great merit—vast and excellent fruits and merits—but also allow practitioners to tread the path of awakening with stability in both this life and at death.  

Ultimately, through cutting off defilements, eradicating latent tendencies, thoroughly understanding the course of life, and exhausting all taints, the practitioner can proceed completely toward Nibbāna, realizing the ultimate peace in which the noble ones abide.
