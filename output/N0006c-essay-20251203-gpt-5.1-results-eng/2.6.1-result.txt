I. Fundamental Principles for Settling the Mind

The primary key to settling the mind lies in clearly recognizing the nature of life and the reality of death. When a practitioner truly confronts the terror of death, they realize that all forms of pursuit are merely temporary and unreliable. Thus they understand the need to contemplate the fear of death, so that insight may arise, leading them to relinquish the chase after desires and no longer waste their mental energy on endless craving and grasping. As the mind gradually lets go of its attachment to the pursuit of desires, the practitioner turns instead to seek inner stillness, longing for an inner stability free from affliction and turmoil. This is precisely the essential principle and direction for the settling of the mind.

I.I Contemplating the Terror of Death and the Aspiration to the Path

When facing death, a practitioner does not merely feel fear, but through observing the terror of death, gives rise to a profound understanding of the true nature of life. When they clearly see that death will inevitably come, and that it is by nature unavoidable and beyond control, a sense of disenchantment with all worldly pursuits of desire naturally arises in the heart. Thus the practitioner understands that they should abandon the pursuit of desires, lest their limited life continue to be consumed by futile craving and attachment. Such realization turns them toward seeking inner stillness, wishing to free the mind from turmoil and fear, to abide in a state of clarity and serenity, and to take this as the fundamental basis for both practice and daily living.

II. A Practitioner’s Mental Attitude and View of Life

A practitioner’s attitude toward life must be grounded in a deep realization of impermanence and limitation. First, one needs to recognize that human life is short and impermanent: no one can guarantee how long they will live, nor can anyone make any firm assurance about the future. Precisely because of this, a practitioner should not allow time to slip away in negligence and heedlessness, but should instead seize the opportunity to do good, and within this limited span of time, actually live out a pure holy life, purifying and elevating body, speech, and mind. This attitude toward life does not arise from panic, but from a lucid understanding of reality.

II.I Attitude Toward Life

Within this understanding, a practitioner must also realize that all living beings will eventually die, without exception. Regardless of status or wealth, all beings are subject to the same law of birth and death; no one can escape this outcome. Such recognition allows the practitioner to see more deeply that clinging to fleeting pleasures and superficial achievements has no true meaning. They then become all the more able to cherish the present opportunities to learn, to do good, and to practice the pure holy life. They no longer delay, nor place the important work of cultivation and virtue in some distant future, but instead begin to put it into practice here and now. Through such an attitude, the practitioner’s mind becomes more resolute and less easily swayed by external changes.

III. Key Points of Practical Cultivation

After establishing a correct view of life and a proper attitude toward practice, one must still implement this in actual conduct for the mind to truly settle. A practitioner should choose environments conducive to calm and introspection—such as beneath a tree, in an empty dwelling, or other quiet places—far from noise and disturbance, so the mind can peacefully observe itself. Being in such an environment is not merely a matter of outward solitude; rather, in every moment one must be wholeheartedly engaged in practice, with both body and mind devoted to cultivation.

III.I The Spirit of Diligent, Unremitting Practice

When a practitioner dwells beneath a tree, in an empty dwelling, or in other quiet places, they should all the more remind themselves not to be heedless in practice. They must not relax simply because the environment is quiet, nor allow the mind to drift merely because time is passing. In every moment, they should guard the mind with lucid awareness, not letting it be led by greed, anger, or delusion. Practice should be vigorous and unremitting, with continuous effort, giving no opportunity for laziness or procrastination to arise. Only in this way can one avoid future regret and not, when life is drawing to its close, lament that one never truly made use of the opportunity to practice. Through the actual cultivation of heedfulness and unceasing effort, a practitioner can transform the contemplation of the terror of death, the understanding of life’s impermanence, and the pursuit of the pure holy life into a genuinely stable and lucid state in which the mind is well settled.
