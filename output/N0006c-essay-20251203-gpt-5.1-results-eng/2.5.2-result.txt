I. The Fundamental Motivation for Guiding Others and the Cultivation of Compassion

When guiding and teaching others, the true and fundamental starting point must arise purely from deep inner sympathy and genuine loving care. Such a motivation for teaching is not for the sake of catering to any particular considerations of social interaction, nor for conforming to any fixed patterns of behavior. It is only because one sincerely cannot bear the suffering of beings and truly feels compassion for them that one is willing to reach out, offer help, and provide guidance. Only with such a pure motivation will one’s teaching not be tainted by selfishness or driven by calculations of gain and benefit.

On the basis of this fundamental motivation, the cultivation of compassion becomes especially important. Day and night the mind should delight in non‑harming; at all times and in all places one should hold compassion for all sentient beings, never giving rise to thoughts of harming others, and certainly never taking pleasure in their suffering. Through long‑term habituation and practice, this compassionate mind gradually becomes firm, so that one ultimately arrives at a state entirely free of anger, where the heart is no longer disturbed by resentment, and toward all beings there remains only pity and forbearance.

II. Rejoicing Equally and Mental Harmony in Lay Life

When entering into lay life and facing all kinds of people, events, and things, one of the principles of conduct is to cultivate an attitude of rejoicing equally. Rejoicing equally means being able to feel joy and contentment with everything that one has, without greedily and endlessly seeking more; at the same time, when seeing others attain achievements or gain benefits, one is likewise able to feel joy and satisfaction for them, without giving rise to jealousy or a sense of unfairness. This attitude of rejoicing equally in regard to both oneself and others helps to harmonize the tension between self and others, so that one is no longer trapped in comparison and competition. In this way it echoes the earlier cultivation of compassion, together forming a sound foundation for mental well‑being.

III. The Protective Power of Liberation through Loving‑Kindness and Its Actual Practice

On the path of inner cultivation, liberation through loving‑kindness has a protective function; thus whether or not one practices liberation through loving‑kindness leads to very different results. If a person neither cultivates liberation through loving‑kindness nor repeatedly puts this liberation into practice, they will easily be disturbed by non‑human beings; both inner and outer circumstances may become unstable due to the lack of the protection provided by loving‑kindness. Conversely, if one truly cultivates liberation through loving‑kindness and continues to practice it without interruption, then those non‑human beings will have no way to disturb or harm such a person, because loving‑kindness itself becomes a firm protection.

Therefore, practitioners should learn and cultivate liberation through loving‑kindness, and not merely on occasion, but through repeated and unceasing practice, allowing the power of loving‑kindness to grow increasingly stable. The method and process of cultivation should be like repeatedly transporting earth and stones with a vehicle in order to gradually build a high platform. Through continual piling up and construction, liberation through loving‑kindness becomes firmly established and stable, not collapsing at the slightest touch. At the same time, for loving‑kindness to continue accumulating and increasing, its cultivation must be well‑planned and diligently carried out, not slack or careless. This attitude of learning, cultivating, and repeatedly putting it into practice must combine continuity with repeated application, so that loving‑kindness can truly become firmly established, and through constant accumulation and good planning grow day by day.

As for the results of karma, the cultivation of loving‑kindness has its own special excellence. Suppose someone in the morning, at midday, and at dusk, in each of these three periods, performs a hundred acts of large‑scale material giving. Although such giving certainly has considerable merit, if during these same three times of day—morning, noon, and evening—one instead spends just a brief period single‑mindedly cultivating loving‑kindness, the resulting fruit will be far greater and more excellent than that obtained from a hundred great material donations made three times daily. From this we can see that the inner cultivation of loving‑kindness brings merit far surpassing that of outward material giving.

When liberation through loving‑kindness has, through repeated cultivation, become firmly established, the mind becomes unwavering, like a high platform built on a solid foundation, not easily shaken. A mind dwelling in such stability allows all malicious intrusions to fail. Those who intend to cause disturbance will instead only bring fatigue, exhaustion, and suffering upon themselves, without being able to shake the already stable mind. Liberation through loving‑kindness is therefore not only a meditative attainment, but also a firm power that protects oneself and prevents one from being moved by malice.

IV. The Overall Framework of Immeasurable Loving‑Kindness and the Cultivation of Wholesome States of Mind

Within the broader methods of liberation of mind, there is a group known as the liberations of mind by the immeasurable states. These liberations of mind by the immeasurable states take as their basis four mental states—loving‑kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity—and cause these four states to pervade all directions and all worlds. When these four states are truly unfolded, the heart naturally becomes vast and able to go far, transcending narrow self‑clinging, displaying the quality of immeasurability and containing no resentment or ill will. Such a state of mind is both the definition of liberation of mind by the immeasurable states and the key way in which it clearly differs from other mental attitudes.

In the course of practice, one must deliberately cultivate a series of wholesome mental states as the foundation for moving toward liberation of mind by the immeasurable states. These wholesome states to be cultivated include: being inwardly free from greed, not being bound by desire; not losing the mind, that is, not being dominated by anger, but able to maintain inward clarity and stability; possessing right view, having correct understanding and judgment of principles and phenomena; and at the same time cultivating loving‑kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity, so that these four mental qualities can be repeatedly exercised and grow in everyday life. When one is able to abandon unwholesome actions and firmly cultivate the wholesome states mentioned above, the mind gradually becomes distant from greed, ill will, and delusion, and is no longer easily stirred by afflictions.

On this basis, practitioners should, with clear comprehension and right mindfulness, cultivate the four states of loving‑kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity, so that these wholesome states do not merely arise briefly but can fill all directions and all worlds, manifesting their vast and immeasurable character and remaining far from resentment and ill will. When focusing specifically on the cultivation of loving‑kindness, one should all the more deliberately distance oneself from greed, anger, and deluded attachment, maintaining clear awareness and right mindfulness, allowing the loving heart to pervade all directions and all worlds, abiding in a state free from resentment and hatred.

Furthermore, when the practitioner advances to a higher stage of cultivation, they will no longer cultivate loving‑kindness alone, but practice the four immeasurable states of loving‑kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity together, allowing all four immeasurable states to pervade all directions and all beings equally. In this process, one should also reflect on the guarantee of ease and happiness brought by pure conduct—that is, contemplate and experience the truth that pure conduct itself ensures the ease and happiness of body and mind. Through such reflection, inner joy, delight, and lightness arise, ultimately leading the mind to a state of deep stability and peace.

V. The Purpose and Basic Method of Practicing the Four Immeasurable States

From the perspective of the four immeasurable states, their cultivation has clear central aims. First, it is to cut off the habitual tendencies of the secondary afflictions that follow the main defilements, so that those subtle afflictions that constantly cling to the mind no longer continue to act. Second, it is to eliminate all factors that weaken wisdom, so that the mind is no longer deprived of insight due to various impurities and confusion. Furthermore, the practice of the four immeasurable states is also for the sake of cutting off the five hindrances, so that these five obstacles, which cover the mind and hinder the development of meditation and wisdom, can dissolve, allowing the mind to return to a clear and lucid state.

As for the concrete basic method of practice, the four immeasurable states share a common foundation of implementation. The practitioner should allow a specific mental attitude—that is, one of loving‑kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, or equanimity—to be conjoined with the mind, rather than merely being contemplated at the level of words or concepts. Once one of these attitudes has been selected, one must first let this state of mind pervade one direction, then extend it to two directions, three directions, and four directions, gradually expanding its scope. Next, one lets this mind pervade above, below, and all around the entire world, so that inwardly one truly encompasses all space in a vast manner. Throughout the entire process of cultivation, one must maintain a mind that is expansive, immeasurable, free from resentment, and free from anger, not allowing hatred and ill will to seep in.

On this basis, each of the four immeasurable states has its own specific mental characteristics. A mind conjoined with loving‑kindness takes kindness as its root, wishing that beings obtain happiness and be freed from the causes of suffering. A mind conjoined with compassion takes empathy and pity as its basis, giving rise to deep concern for the suffering of beings and wishing that they be freed from suffering. A mind conjoined with empathetic joy is grounded in joy for the happiness and wholesome deeds of beings, sincerely praising and rejoicing in the good fortune and merit of others. A mind conjoined with equanimity is grounded in impartial letting‑go, relating to all beings without bias, not being swayed by liking and disliking, or by closeness and distance, but maintaining an attitude of equality and clarity. Through the differentiated cultivation of these four attitudes and their extension to all directions, the fundamental functions of the four immeasurable states are gradually brought to full manifestation.

VI. The Sequence, Attainments, and Wisdom‑Characteristics of the Four Liberations of Mind

At a deeper level of progressive practice, the four immeasurable states correspond respectively to four paths of cultivation and ultimate attainments called liberations of mind. The first is the cultivation of liberation of mind through loving‑kindness. When cultivating loving‑kindness, the practitioner must rely on seclusion—that is, maintain distance from various defilements and impurities; at the same time rely on freedom from greed, so that the heart is no longer entangled by attachment; and further rely on extinction, so that defilements are gradually extinguished, and in the end direct all merits toward equanimity, allowing the mind to abide in a state free from clinging. In this process, one cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment conjoined with loving‑kindness, namely: mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy, joy, lightness of body and mind, concentration, and equanimity. When liberation of mind through loving‑kindness is perfectly accomplished, the attainment reached is called pure liberation; along this path of practice, purity is regarded as the supreme, highest attainment.

Next is the cultivation of liberation of mind through compassion. In the same way, when cultivating compassion one must proceed by relying on seclusion, on freedom from greed, and on extinction, ultimately directing all merits toward equanimity, so that the mind is not stained by attachment. One also cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment conjoined with compassion, allowing the mind, while filled with compassion, still to possess mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy, joy, lightness, concentration, and equanimity as seven aids to awakening. When liberation of mind through compassion is accomplished, the corresponding attainment is the sphere of infinite space, which, along this path of practice, is regarded as the supreme, highest attainment.

The third is the cultivation of liberation of mind through empathetic joy. Here too one must rely on seclusion, on freedom from greed, and on extinction, and finally direct all cultivation toward equanimity, avoiding attachment even to joy itself. Likewise, one cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment conjoined with empathetic joy, so that in the midst of joy the mind still possesses mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy, joy, lightness, concentration, and equanimity as seven supports on the path. When liberation of mind through empathetic joy is perfected, the attainment reached is the sphere of infinite consciousness, which, along this route of practice, is the supreme, highest attainment.

Lastly, there is the cultivation of liberation of mind through equanimity. In cultivating equanimity, one still purifies the mind following the principles of relying on seclusion, on freedom from greed, and on extinction, and directs the entire practice toward equanimity, allowing the mind to maintain clear impartiality and non‑attachment. At this time one cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment conjoined with equanimity—likewise consisting of mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy, joy, lightness, concentration, and equanimity—only now operating in alignment with the state of equanimity. When liberation of mind through equanimity is brought to completion, the attainment reached is the sphere of nothingness, which, along this path of cultivation, is regarded as the supreme, highest attainment.

Taken together, each liberation of mind has its own specific highest attainment: liberation of mind through loving‑kindness takes purity as supreme; liberation of mind through compassion takes the sphere of infinite space as supreme; liberation of mind through empathetic joy takes the sphere of infinite consciousness as supreme; and liberation of mind through equanimity takes the sphere of nothingness as supreme. Before a practitioner has realized higher levels of liberation, they will, in the particular liberation of mind they are currently cultivating, possess the corresponding level of wisdom. In other words, each level of liberation has its own specific kind of insight associated with it, and the manifestation and depth of this wisdom depend on the degree to which the practitioner has accomplished that level of liberation. Through such step‑by‑step cultivation—from nurturing a pure motivation for teaching, to cultivating loving‑kindness, compassion, and rejoicing, then stabilizing liberation through loving‑kindness, and finally perfecting the four immeasurable states and the four liberations of mind—the heart ultimately attains purified liberation, becomes free from secondary afflictions and the five hindrances, and realizes the distinctive wisdom corresponding to each level of attainment.
