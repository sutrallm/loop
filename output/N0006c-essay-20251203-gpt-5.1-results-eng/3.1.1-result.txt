I. The Disturbances Encountered in Practice and Their Nature

I.1 Concrete Manifestations of Disturbance

In the course of practice, practitioners often encounter disturbances in a variety of forms. Sometimes these disturbances present themselves as terrifying scenes that arouse fear; sometimes they appear as various pure and impure forms, as if displaying luminous or defiled realms that tempt the practitioner to give rise to discriminative thoughts about them. 

At the same time, disturbance may also manifest as doubts about the practitioner’s daily routine—for example, arousing all kinds of misgivings about whether one’s sleep and rest accord with the requirements of practice, making one suspect that one is regressing on the path because of taking rest. In addition, erroneous views about the length of life may arise—either clinging to long life or fearing short life—so that one is drawn by concepts regarding lifespan and thereby deviates from the central focus of practice. 

Further, the disturbing forces may encourage attachment to relatives, possessions, and other worldly matters, using the bonds of emotion and ownership to re‑entangle the practitioner in family, affection, and wealth, making it difficult to remain at peace on the path of practice.

I.2 The Root of Disturbance and the True Nature of External Phenomena

All of these disturbances fundamentally arise from attachment to the various appearances of purity and impurity. When practitioners become attached to all the forms, realms, feelings, and thoughts that they experience—whether they regard them as pure and delightful or impure and repulsive—such attachment itself becomes a condition for long‑enduring saṃsāra. Those who disturb the practice intentionally make use of this, seeking to shake the practitioner’s resolve through fear and temptation. By means of horrifying scenes, seductive visions, wrong views, and emotional entanglements, they cause practitioners either to shrink back in panic or to linger in greed and attachment.

From the standpoint of the true nature of external phenomena, however, these disturbances do not represent any real destruction or rupture of reality. It is not that the world itself has undergone genuine collapse or transformation, but merely that malicious forces seek to obscure the practitioner’s vision, and the resulting appearances are what we see. The intention of these forces is simply to arouse terror, to make practitioners feel uneasy about what they see and encounter, thereby shaking their resolve and causing them to stray from the right path. 

If one does not understand this point, it is easy to take these illusory appearances as real changes, and thus to sink ever deeper into them.

I.3 The Attitude of the Accomplished Practitioner Toward Disturbance and Its Outcome

When practitioners gradually mature and achieve a certain level of accomplishment, they are able to clearly see through the source and nature of such disturbances, realizing that they are nothing but unreal manifestations, fabricated illusory realms produced by malicious intent. Because they can see their roots and purposes as they really are, their minds no longer turn in response to external conditions: they are not shaken by what is fearful, nor are they deluded by seductive scenes.

When the mind thus no longer turns with conditions, it naturally becomes free from fear and is no longer ruled by dread. As the mind ceases to respond to the temptations and threats of disturbance, those disturbing forces gradually fade away and can no longer exert any real influence on the practitioner. The path of practice then becomes steady and can proceed forward.

II. The Course of Energetic Practice and Liberation of Mind

II.1 Repeated Experiences of Temporary Liberation of Mind

When practice has reached a certain depth, if practitioners remain unremitting, devout, and diligent in right cultivation, they may, at a certain stage, attain a temporary liberation of mind. “Temporary liberation of mind” means that for a certain period the mind is freed from various bonds, afflictions, and delusions, and abides in a higher and purer state.

However, in actual experience this liberation of mind is often not permanent: later, regression may occur. That is, although liberation has been attained, certain fetters appear again, and the previously gained liberated state is temporarily lost.

This does not occur only once, but repeats many times. Practitioners repeatedly cultivate with an attitude that is unremitting, devout, and diligent; they repeatedly attain temporary liberation of mind, and then repeatedly undergo regression. In this way, the experience of gaining and then losing liberation appears six times in succession. Each instance of liberation is a real though temporary transcendence, and each regression serves as a reminder that certain inner factors have not yet been thoroughly eradicated. This series of repeated gain and loss forms scene after tense scene on the practitioner’s path to liberation of mind.

II.2 The Final Effort and Resolute Decision

When this process reaches the seventh time, practitioners still remain unremitting, devout, and diligent, continuing to abide in practice and once again attaining temporary liberation of mind. Yet, since the memory of the six regressions is still vivid, they have a very deep impression of having repeatedly gained and then lost liberation. Thus, a certain resolute thought arises in their hearts, like taking up a sword.

This “thought of taking up a sword” does not mean actually taking a weapon in hand, but symbolizes a determination that is extremely firm, sharp, and unwilling to retreat—a resolve to cut off completely the very roots that lead to regression and to end this repeated pattern of gain and loss. Because of this decisive mind, the seventh round of practice takes on the special significance of a watershed, laying a crucial step toward a more ultimate state of liberation.

II.3 The Perfection of Concentration and Wisdom and the Requirement of Secluded Life

Amid such repetition and resolve, practitioners also gradually move toward the accomplishment of concentration and wisdom. When the mind can immerse single‑pointedly in meditative contemplation and truly attain one‑pointed focus, then all the afflictions that drive saṃsāra can be completely stilled and cease to arise. At that point, the roots of affliction are extinguished, the driving force of saṃsāra disappears, and the mind is no longer pushed about within the stream of birth and death.

To attain such a state, practitioners often need to live in seclusion and practice alone, in an environment far removed from disturbance, facing their own body‑mind and afflictions by themselves, practicing the teaching in an unremitting, devout, and diligent manner. Through long periods of such secluded practice, they can, within this very life, accomplish the unsurpassed holy life—that is, the highest, purest mode of practice—so that practice does not remain only at the level of theory or fleeting experience, but is perfectly fulfilled in this present lifetime.

III. Attitudes of Mind in Practice and the Correspondence of Sense Bases and Objects

III.1 Three Orientations Toward Thoughts

In the interaction between the sense bases and their objects, a practitioner’s attitude toward arising thoughts is an important indicator of the level of practice. When a thought arises, if the practitioner approves of it and is unwilling to abandon it, clinging to it and following it, this is regarded as falling away from wholesome dharmas and is called regression in dharma. In other words, wholesome qualities that have already been established will gradually deteriorate because of accepting thoughts that ought not to be clung to, and the direction of practice becomes skewed.

If, when a thought arises, the practitioner does not approve of it but instead clearly recognizes it and then abandons and excludes it, not allowing it to remain in the mind, then the previously established wholesome dharmas can be maintained without regression; this is non‑regression in dharma. This means that although thoughts still appear, the practitioner is not led by them and can protect the wholesome dharmas already attained, keeping practice firm and unshaken.

A more sublime state is one in which the binding factors no longer arise at their root—that is, those fetters that lead to attachment and saṃsāra no longer appear even in the form of thoughts. In this state, the practitioner no longer needs to counteract them by way of rejection, because the corresponding thoughts and fetters simply do not arise. This state is the most excellent locus and abiding, called the “supreme place” (or “excellent state”), and is a very important hallmark in practice.

III.2 Comprehending Feelings and Abiding in Realization in This Very Life

When practitioners have gained thorough understanding of the arising, change, and cessation of feelings, and truly penetrate the nature of feeling, they attain realization in this very life. In such attainment, they abide in self‑knowing—that is, personally knowing the state of the mind and the true nature of phenomena, rather than relying on others’ explanations or mere faith. They also abide in direct realization, actually experiencing and confirming the truth of the teaching, not merely understanding it theoretically. Furthermore, they abide in attainment, genuinely acquiring and dwelling within the states they have realized, so that these realizations are no longer fleeting, momentary experiences, but accomplishments in which they can abide for long periods.

IV. Difficulties on the Path of Practice

IV.1 The Difficulty of Going Forth and Abandoning Attachment

Within this teaching, truly abandoning lay life and going forth into homelessness (ordaining) is in itself an extremely difficult matter. For most people, leaving behind familiar family, occupation, and social status, and relinquishing their previous interpersonal and material supports, is a threshold very hard to cross. Thus, on this path, simply being willing to go forth has already taken a precious step that is hard to take.

Yet for those who have already gone forth, an even greater difficulty lies in relinquishing attachment and delight in the world. Even if they have outwardly left family and social roles, their hearts may still be deeply bound to reputation, status, emotional ties, sense pleasures, and even to various subtle likes and preferences. Truly letting go of these delights in the context of monastic life is another extremely arduous level of practice.

For practitioners who have already striven to abandon delight in the world, among all these difficulties, the hardest of all is to practice in accordance with the teaching in a direct and genuine way—that is, what is called “practicing with the dharma as standard for the dharma.” This means not only understanding the teaching, but also gradually embodying it in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, constantly taking the dharma as the criterion, and adjusting body and mind, changing habits, and countering afflictions in accordance with it. Such implementation of “acting in line with the dharma” is, beyond going forth and beyond giving up attachment, an even more advanced and demanding task.

IV.2 Practicing with the Dharma as Standard and the Obstacles in Initial States of Concentration

In the process of gradually embodying the teaching, when practitioners begin to undertake the path of realization—especially in the initial stages of realization—they often encounter the problem that states of concentration are not easily stabilized. Even when they have entered certain states of meditative absorption or realization, perceptions of material form—that is, sensations related to the physical body and external environment—still arise from time to time; mental activity also continues to appear, becoming a major factor disturbing the stability of concentration. These perceptions and thoughts make it difficult for the mind to abide for long in a pure and stable state of concentration, so that repeated subduing and counteracting are required in order gradually to calm the mind, making it quiet, clear, and not easily disturbed.

V. Deep Meditative States and the Sequence of Realization

V.1 From the Sphere of Infinite Space to the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness

As practitioners progress deeper in concentration, going beyond coarse states of absorption, they may enter more subtle immaterial attainments. One stage is to transcend all the sphere of infinite space—that is, no longer merely remain within the attainment called the sphere of infinite space. Having gone beyond it, practitioners can realize and abide in the sphere of infinite consciousness, in which they rely on boundless and vast consciousness as their object and experience consciousness as immeasurable and limitless, free from narrow boundaries.

V.2 The Nature of the Sphere of Nothingness and Its Initial Instability

Above the sphere of infinite consciousness is an even more refined state, namely, the sphere of nothingness. The nature of this state lies in transcending all of the sphere of infinite consciousness; that is, even the manifestations of boundless consciousness no longer serve as the object, and thus what is called “nothingness” appears. When practitioners go beyond all states related to the sphere of infinite consciousness and realize and abide in this “nothingness,” they are said to abide in the sphere of nothingness.

However, upon first entering the sphere of nothingness, practitioners may still experience concepts and directed attention related to the sphere of infinite consciousness—that is, they may occasionally give rise to notions and attentiveness corresponding to the previous state. These residual signs and directed thoughts show that they have not yet attained completely stable abiding in the sphere of nothingness; the influence of the previous state has not been entirely eliminated. Therefore, at this point the attainment is still in an unstable phase, requiring further adjustment and deepening.

V.3 Complete Fulfillment of the Sphere of Nothingness and the Kindness of the Teacher

When practitioners are able to cultivate again in accordance with the correct key of the mind—that is, when they grasp the proper essentials and direction of mental cultivation and repeatedly develop and strengthen their experience of the sphere of nothingness—they can truly go beyond all of the sphere of infinite consciousness and fully attain and abide in the sphere of nothingness. In this state, they are no longer pulled by previous attainments; the sphere of nothingness becomes a state in which they can genuinely abide for long periods, and thus it can be said that this attainment has been perfectly fulfilled.

Such perfect fulfillment is at the same time a clear example of a disciple’s gaining great all‑pervading wisdom through the gracious guidance of a teacher. Because the teacher skillfully explains the correct essentials of the mind and leads the practitioner step by step beyond various states, the disciple does not become lost in them and ultimately achieves this broad and all‑encompassing wisdom. This can be regarded as the fruit born of both the teacher’s kindness and the practitioner’s own cultivation acting together.

V.4 The Definition of the Signless Concentration of Mind and the Keys to Its Practice

Among the many states of meditative absorption, the signless concentration of mind is a particularly special attainment. “Signless concentration of mind” refers to a state in which a bhikṣu, in practice, does not contemplate any external or internal “signs” (marks, forms, or distinguishing characteristics) at all, but reaches and abides in this signless concentration of mind. In such samādhi, the mind does not stand relying on any sign; hence it is called “signless.” Attaining such an accomplishment likewise stems from the teaching and kindness of the teacher, who helps the practitioner understand how to let go of attachment to all signs and thus enter this state.

In practicing the signless concentration of mind, there are several key principles that must be observed. First, practitioners must not be heedless; they must constantly maintain mindfulness and alertness, not allowing distraction, laziness, or indulgence to enter the mind. Second, they should establish the mind firmly in the signless concentration of mind—that is, take this state as their object and repeatedly familiarize and consolidate themselves in it. Third, they must make the mind unified, not letting it scatter among many objects, but continually sustaining it within this signless samādhi. Only when non‑heedlessness, stable abiding, and one‑pointedness are all present can the signless concentration of mind become truly stable and accomplished.

VI. Types of Practitioners and Evaluation of Their Results

VI.1 Those Who Only Practice Austerities but Gain Neither Wholesome Dharma nor Realization

Among practitioners, one can distinguish and assess them according to whether they have gained wholesome dharmas and whether they have, in this very life, realized superhuman noble knowledge and vision. 

The first type are those who abuse themselves with austerities yet do not gain understanding of wholesome dharmas and do not, in this life, realize any superhuman noble knowledge and vision. Although such practitioners are outwardly extremely austere, even deliberately subjecting body and mind to severe hardship, because they lack true insight into wholesome dharmas and have not directly realized any superhuman noble knowledge and vision, they should be censured on three counts: they abuse themselves with austerities, they have not gained wholesome dharmas, and they have not attained noble knowledge and vision.

VI.2 Those Who Gain Wholesome Dharma but Do Not Attain Realization

The second type of practitioner also abuses himself with austerities, but differs in that he has already gained understanding of wholesome dharmas, though he still has not realized, in this life, any superhuman noble knowledge and vision. For this type of person, because he still torments himself with austerities and has not actually attained noble knowledge and vision, he should be censured on these two counts: for his austerities and for his lack of realization. 

On the other hand, since he truly has come to understand wholesome dharmas and grasped the principles of the true teaching, he is worthy of praise on this point. Thus, such a practitioner has both aspects that deserve criticism and aspects that merit approval.

VI.3 Those Who Gain Wholesome Dharma and Have Attained Realization

The third type of practitioner likewise abuses himself with austerities, but he not only has understood wholesome dharmas; he has also, in this life, realized superhuman noble knowledge and vision. Such a practitioner still has the fault of self‑torment through austerities, and therefore should still be censured on the single count of his austerities. However, because he has truly understood wholesome dharmas and directly realized superhuman noble knowledge and vision, he should be praised on these two counts: for his understanding of wholesome dharmas and for his present realization of noble knowledge and vision. 

Thus, the evaluation of this type of practitioner includes both criticism of his austere method and high commendation of his wisdom and realized attainment.

VII. Perfect Fulfillment, Orientation Toward Nirvāṇa, and Care at the Time of Death

VII.1 Vast Attainment in All Dharmas and the Ultimate Holy Life

When the course of practice gradually reaches fulfillment, the final fruit of practice is vast attainment in all dharmas. Such attainment is not confined to a single aspect, but is extensive and complete in all relevant dharmas—including morality, concentration, and wisdom, as well as various contemplations and realizations. For such a practitioner, in this life he has fully completed the unsurpassed holy life—that is, he has brought to completion the highest, purest, and most perfect mode of practice. 

Moreover, he accomplishes this state by dwelling in self‑realization, direct realization, and completeness: he realizes it personally, experiences it directly in the present, and abides in it with all associated qualities perfected, rather than relying merely on hearsay or conjecture.

VII.2 Self‑Realization, Direct Realization, and Orientation of the Mind Toward Nirvāṇa

On the basis of such perfect fulfillment, the practitioner also clearly understands the cessation of the five sense faculties. When he knows the point at which each faculty ceases, it can be said that he has truly realized the cessation of that faculty—that is, he has direct knowledge of the extinction of each sense base. Through this insight into the cessation of the faculties, he can, on this basis, guide his mind to incline toward nirvāṇa, freeing it from attachment to the faculties and their objects and directing it toward the goal of ultimate quiescence. Thus, self‑realization and direct realization are not only experiences of the present state, but also the key grounds for leading the mind toward nirvāṇa.

VII.3 The Gradual Elevation of Mind at the Time of Death

In the concrete implementation of end‑of‑life care, how to guide the thoughts of the dying is also an important aspect that corresponds to the fruits of practice. In this regard there is an ordered progression by which the mind can be elevated.

First, the caregiver guides the dying person’s thoughts away from entanglement with human desires and gradually toward higher heavenly realms, so that he may temporarily let go of attachment to human sensual pleasures. Then, one proceeds further, leading his mind step by step upward toward higher heavens, enabling it to leave lower‑level attachments and gradually incline toward purer and more subtle realms.

On this basis, the ultimate aim is to direct the dying person’s thoughts toward a quiescent state that transcends all formed existence, so that he no longer remains at any concrete or even subtle form of existence, but inclines instead toward true quiescence. Through such gradual guidance—from human desires, to pure heavenly realms, and finally to a quiescent domain beyond all formed existence—end‑of‑life care thus echoes the overarching direction of the path of practice, so that even at the last moment of life, the movement of the mind can be oriented toward ultimate liberation.
