I. The Fundamental Meaning of Liberation and Its Ultimate State  

I.1 The Definition of Liberation and the Ultimate Aim of Life  
What is called “liberation” refers to a state in which the mind attains complete and thorough release. It is the final fulfillment of all practice, the utmost perfection of absolute safety and purity, and also the ultimate goal toward which life can be directed. One who has reached such a state is regarded as the most excellent among humans and heavenly beings.

The fundamental content of liberation lies in the destruction of greed, the destruction of hatred, and the destruction of delusion. This destruction itself is called nirvāṇa, and is also called the fruition of arahantship. When craving is completely extinguished, that is nirvāṇa. When the mind is freed from all grasping and attains liberation, this is equivalent to having laid down the entire burden of body, mind, and saṃsāra, thereby truly attaining one’s own ultimate welfare.

In this state, consciousness has no basis on which to depend, it no longer grows, and it no longer fabricates; therefore it is called “liberated.” Once consciousness is liberated, it can dwell securely; from secure dwelling comes contentment; from contentment, fear is no more; and from the absence of fear one reaches final nirvāṇa. This ultimately stable dwelling signifies that all defilements have been extinguished, the spirit is completely free, consciousness is tranquil, wisdom appears, and truth is directly realized as it really is. By right reflection and right effort, a practitioner can actually realize this unsurpassed liberation. This liberation is both “liberation of mind” and “liberation by wisdom”; the two correspond and together form a state free of all outflows (āsavas).

In the complete sequence of practice, the Seven Factors of Awakening are the seven kinds of qualities to be cultivated, while “knowledge (illumination)” and “liberation” are the two final, perfected results. “Knowledge” means the full unfolding of wisdom; “liberation” means freedom from every form of bondage. Only through skillful cultivation in accordance with the aforementioned sequence can one finally bring these two aims to perfection, reach the state of nirvāṇa, know and realize it for oneself, and directly see the pure Dharma.

I.2 The Ending of Birth-and-Death and the Cessation of Future Rebirth  
The liberated one is therefore called “one whose taints are destroyed” because, by means of liberating knowledge, he knows as it really is that: the arising of life has ended; the pure holy life has been established; all that ought to be done has been fully accomplished; henceforth there will be no further state of existence, no further round of birth and death. This liberating knowledge is often expressed as a direct realization of “birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.” It is also phrased as: “The stream of birth-and-death has been exhausted; the pure practice has been firmly established; what ought to be done has been completed; there will be no future cycle of birth and death.” Sometimes, in the mind, this wisdom appears as the distinct awareness: “I am liberated.”

This awareness does not arise relying on any particular spoken phrase or written formula; it is founded upon a direct and realistic observation of the law of cause and effect and of all phenomena. When a practitioner truly contemplates the arising and cessation of dependent origination, when all grasping is extinguished and he abides in right mindfulness, this liberating knowledge naturally arises, without needing any further external condition.

Because of this realization, death and the end of this life are no longer regarded by the liberated one as something unwholesome; hence there is nothing fearful about them. Although the physical body must in the end decay and be relinquished, in the eyes of the liberated one this is merely the cessation and subsiding of the impermanent and suffering components of the five aggregates; the root of saṃsāra has already been completely severed.

When one whose taints are utterly destroyed lays down the human body, he is no longer reborn in heavenly realms or in any other planes of existence. He no longer enters into the “number of embodied beings,” and is no longer drawn by the bonds of any world—whether of gods or of humans. The liberated one knows that he has put down the heavy burden of body, mind, and saṃsāra, has obtained his own ultimate welfare, has nothing further that remains to be done, and has no need to augment what has already been achieved. Regarding the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—he also knows as it really is that these bases will completely cease without remainder and will not arise again elsewhere. Concerning this very body he now has, he likewise knows its impermanence as it really is, and thereby transcends attachment to “having a body,” attaining liberation.

I.3 The Content of the Destruction of the Taints, Liberation of Mind, and Liberation by Wisdom  
In the accomplishment of liberation, the “destruction of the taints” is the crucial hallmark. The taints (āsavas) are the flowing defilements born of sensual desire, existence, and ignorance, comprising the taint of sensuality, the taint of existence, and the taint of ignorance. When the taints of sensuality, existence, and ignorance are completely brought to a halt, this is called the total destruction of the taints or the complete exhaustion of the taints, indicating that all defilements have been utterly cut off and the round of birth and death is altogether ended. This condition is called “without taints,” meaning that there is no longer any new defilement that can give rise to saṃsāra.

“Liberation of mind” means that the inner mind is freed from all clinging and bondage, especially the complete cessation of delight-and-greed. When delight-and-greed has entirely ceased, this is called liberation of mind, also called “good (or well-attained) liberation.” The state of good liberation is established on the basis of thorough disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. Based on no longer grasping them, liberation is attained. When the five aggregates are no longer appropriated, one reaches a state of utter purity with no admixture; in this pure state there is no longer any rotation or change that can be designated. It is called the ultimate, unalterable establishment.

“Liberation by wisdom” means liberation attained through wisdom. When a practitioner realistically observes the causal relations of phenomena, and their impermanence, suffering, and non-self, wisdom fully develops, enabling him to know the characteristics of all phenomena correctly and to be utterly free of doubt concerning the sequence of arising and cessation. In this way, by means of wisdom, liberation is attained, and this is called “liberation by wisdom.”

Liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom are often simultaneously present, forming the complete state of “taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom.” At that time, the practitioner, in this very life, knows and realizes for himself, directly verifies the truth, and abides in full completion.

Within the system of the nine successive liberations, there is also an explanation of the different depths and levels of liberation. What is called “liberation that has enjoyment as its food” is liberation connected with form; “liberation that has no enjoyment as its food” is connected with the formless; and “liberation that has no enjoyment whatsoever as its food” arises through contemplating the mind that is already liberated from greed, hatred, and delusion, and from this contemplation a still higher level of liberation is born. When a practitioner continually observes the mind freed from sensual desire, the mind freed from hatred, and the mind freed from delusion, and abides therein, what then arises is the ultimate liberation based upon a mind whose taints are completely exhausted.

II. The Inner Mental State and Wisdom-Characteristics of the Liberated One  

II.1 Purity Free of Stain and the Mind’s Easeful Abiding  
The mental state of the liberated one is first manifested as complete purity. One who is pure has no evil or defilement whatsoever; the mind is pure and unstained. Such a consciousness is tranquil and gentle, not shaken by anger, far from vexation and craving. One whose practice is fulfilled has cut off all defilements; thus his mind attains ultimate peace, constantly maintaining stillness and happiness, with body and mind upright and well established. In this tranquil mental state, there is an abundance of the joy of meditation; right mindfulness is ever present, enabling the abandonment of all sorrow.

One who is pure and undefiled is not affected by external contacts; incoming contact and stimulation cannot arouse defiled waves in his mind. If someone directs evil thoughts toward him, such evil thoughts merely rebound upon the foolish person himself and cannot stain the inner mind of the pure one. Regarding all feelings, one whose practice is complete understands them thoroughly. Because the wise one fully knows all feelings, he has, in this very life, no further taint whatsoever. He can abandon all underlying tendencies (latent dispositions) of sensual desire, of ill will, and of ignorance.

In this state, the mind of the liberated one is completely free and at ease. Internally there is no longer any attachment or clinging, nor is his mind moved by external conditions. Even when facing thousands of intrusions and external changes, his mind remains calm and steady, giving rise to not even the slightest fear. Because he is free from craving, the mind is naturally at peace, transcending all bonds and fetters, with neither regret nor suffering, abiding day and night in tranquility. Concerning all sentient bodies and all external forms, he has already gone beyond the conceit “I am” and the attachment “what I am.”

Some practitioners keep their hearts tranquil through day and night, harboring no deceit or hypocrisy and no desires, abiding in such a pure state. They follow the path of quietude walked by the noble and wise, relying on the power of nirvāṇa to extinguish all defilements, and serenely await the moment of final nirvāṇa (parinirvāṇa). For such a one, this very life is his “last body.” He no longer chases after any wishes in this life, but simply and firmly devotes himself, day and night, to the path of practice.

II.2 Transcending Greed, Hatred, Delusion, and All Bondage and Fetters  
The reason the liberated one can abide in a mind that is pure and tranquil lies in the complete cutting off of greed, hatred, and delusion and all the bonds associated with them. The destruction of greed, the destruction of hatred, and the destruction of delusion are not only described as the content of nirvāṇa and the fruition of arahantship but are also called the complete attainment of “full understanding.” In such a state, the root defilements that give rise to saṃsāra have all been fully known and utterly extinguished. The complete cessation of craving is nirvāṇa. When the liberated one has uprooted the root of craving, he no longer fears birth and death and no longer longs for rebirth.

In actual practice, liberation often begins from “revulsion” and “disenchantment.” When a noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—and with the feelings that arise dependent on these six sense bases, then from disenchantment comes dispassion, and from dispassion comes liberation. Concerning the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness, he likewise becomes disenchanted; because of disenchantment he is dispassionate; because of dispassion he is liberated. Through this process of becoming free from desire, he no longer clings to or relies upon the five aggregates, thereby achieving lasting liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom.

In this process, the “conceit ‘I am’,” the attachment “mine,” and the latent tendency “I” associated with the five clung-to aggregates are completely extinguished and forever cut off. The latent tendency of conceit that accompanies the five clung-to aggregates ceases forever and never arises again. The practitioner no longer takes “I” as the center for measuring strength or weakness, nor does he inflict any violence upon those weaker or stronger than he is. He is able to harbor no violent thoughts toward either the weak or the strong. His morality is utterly pure, like a well-tamed great elephant—steady and never out of measure.

The liberated one possesses zeal and deep circumspection. He clearly knows that he should remain far from all bonds and actually has cut off attachment, hatred, and ignorance, reaching the state where defilements are totally extinguished. He not only externally refrains from unwholesome behavior but also eradicates, in the innermost depths of his mind, all the crooked, twisted, and unstraight tendencies of the past, leaving no gap where Māra or defilements can invade.

To be liberated from the taints of sensual desire, existence, and ignorance means that the latent dispositions of sensuality, hatred, and delusion are completely abandoned, craving is severed, fetters are destroyed, and conceit has perished, so that he arrives at the far shore of suffering and no new suffering arises.

On the inner level, this liberation is also manifested in his clear observation of the mind freed from sensual desire, freed from hatred, and freed from delusion. When the practitioner repeatedly contemplates with wisdom the mind that is already liberated from greed, hatred, and delusion, what he sees is a mind free of taints, a mind no longer bound by any defilement. Complete cognition refers precisely to the total extinction of greed, hatred, and delusion. When delight-and-greed has entirely ceased, this is called liberation of mind, or good (well-attained) liberation, indicating that the very roots of all defilements have been utterly cut off, like completely chopping through the roots of a palmyra tree so it will never again grow in the future.

II.3 Wisdom, Right Mindfulness, and Complete Awakening  
Another important characteristic of the liberated one is the full development of wisdom and right mindfulness. His consciousness is tranquil, and wisdom naturally appears, enabling him to realize truth as it really is. This wisdom does not depend on others’ words; it arises directly from his own inner contemplation. When he no longer doubts or hesitates, when he needs no other conditions but relies solely on his own realistic observation of all phenomena to directly realize the truth, wisdom arises naturally in that very moment.

On the level of wisdom, the liberated one is described as having penetrated the three supreme knowledges and possessing vast and boundless supernormal powers. He is called “one who has attained seeing,” “one who has attained the true Dharma,” and “one who has seen the true Dharma.” He is endowed with the wisdom of a learner and with the illumination of a learner, has fulfilled the holy, clear, penetrating wisdom, has entered the stream of truth, and has established the door to the deathless. Such a person has been born into the lineage of the Awakened One, has realized the unsurpassed truth, is endowed with all wisdom, can see through everything, and subdues and utterly destroys all unwholesome states.

On the level of mental functioning, he is skillful in the concentration of mind and in the application of right mindfulness. He can enter meditation with right mindfulness, apart from all disputes and defilements, and abide in concentration. As a meditator who dwells free from contention, he clearly understands the rise and fall of worldly conditions but does not cling to them. He is like one who has crossed over danger and gone beyond the torrent; he is no longer submerged in the waters of birth and death, and for this he is described as “not sunken,” no longer sinking in saṃsāra. Regarding all enjoyments and feelings, he understands them completely and thereby reaches the law-abiding state of the far shore of supreme wisdom, directly sees the truth, and attains freedom from taints, dwelling firmly on the far shore of supreme wisdom.

For the liberated one, wisdom and liberation become two mutually confirming facets of liberating knowledge. On one hand, there is “right knowledge,” that is, correct and perfect wisdom; on the other hand, there is “right liberation,” that is, correct and complete deliverance. The two support each other, enabling him, in this very life, to know fully the nature of suffering, to verify the truth personally, and to eradicate defilements completely. This perfect wisdom also appears in his thorough understanding of the five aggregates, the six sense bases, and all phenomena of dependent arising.

III. The Objective State of Liberation and Transcendence of the World  

III.1 Transcending Birth and Death, Māra’s Host, and All Realms of Existence  
The state of the liberated one is first manifested as transcendence of all bonds and fetters. He has gone beyond every form of bondage, and there is nothing left for him to cling to; in his heart there is no basis for dependence or attachment. Because all taints are exhausted, he is called a “person of the last body,” signifying that after this life there will be no more rounds of birth and death. Concerning the heavenly realms, the human realm, and any possible abode whatsoever, no matter how one searches, one cannot find his trace, for he is entirely unbound by any level of existence.

This transcendence is especially evident in his victory over death and the realm of Māra (Death/Māra). He has surpassed the domain of the Death-Māra; once he has given up the human body, he is not reborn in any heavenly realm or bound by any such existence. Through practice, he has broken the army of Death, no longer walking the road of rebirth. Having uprooted the root of craving, he has realized nirvāṇa and no longer fears the threat of birth and death. Māra’s forces cannot trace his footsteps; his conduct does not revolve according to Māra’s will. He is like the sun, whose radiance shines everywhere—bright and untouchable. Even when defilements and Māra-obstacles approach, he can scatter them so that the hosts of Māra cannot find any clue to his path to liberation.

Māra’s disturbances have become utterly ineffectual because the inner mind of the liberated one has been brought to completion. Since he has realized liberation, Māra can no longer exert any real influence over him. Māra cannot understand such a way of practice, does not know how he has been liberated, and cannot find any gap through which to enter his mind. All the crooked, twisted, and unstraight tendencies of the past have been eradicated; the roots of greed, hatred, and delusion have been cut off; the mind is without greed and without craving; thus Māra’s disturbances are quickly blown away like leaves in a gust of wind.

In some descriptions, when a practitioner, taking up a blade, ends his physical life, his consciousness has already attained final nirvāṇa, and there is no longer any abode for it. Though Māra the Evil One searches in all directions for this practitioner’s aggregate of consciousness, he ultimately cannot find any support or dwelling place for it, because this consciousness has attained final nirvāṇa without a basis of abiding. Such a practitioner’s resolve is firm; he has long abiding joy in meditative contemplation, is devoted to the path day and night, and no longer pins any hopes on this life. The root of craving has been uprooted, and the army of Death has been conquered. Since the bonds of life have come to an end, when the body decays, he no longer enters any new existence in saṃsāra.

III.2 The Transformation of the Relationship Between Body, Mind, and the World  
Although the liberated one has completely freed himself from all mental bondage, his physical body is still composed of the four great elements, born from his parents, sustained by food, subject to decay, consumption, damage, and eventual destruction. This body is sometimes likened to a vehicle made of the four great elements: the vehicle itself will grow old and break down and eventually disappear. The “vehicle” symbolizing the body is impermanent and fragile. A “spoke” of the wheel symbolizes right mindfulness, the key support for directing movement. The “turning” of the wheel signifies the changes of advance and retreat in action. The “white canopy” symbolizes the pure state of liberation; “without defect” symbolizes morality that is complete and flawless. Though the liberated one still dwells in such an impermanent, decaying body, his mind has already transcended the limitations of the body and no longer generates attachment to “I” and “mine” with respect to it.

In interacting with the world, one whose practice is complete does not engage in disputes. Having fully penetrated and understood all kinds of desires, he constantly enjoys freedom of mind. When facing all sorts of external appearances, with regard both to the sentient body within and all phenomena without, he has gone far beyond the conceit “I am” and “what is mine,” and no longer generates self-centered comparisons of higher and lower. Complete and pure morality renders his deportment pure and dignified. He knows for himself, through realization, that he has entered liberation and abides in it, clearly understanding that birth is ended, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.

Regarding changes in external circumstances—whether his form is hidden or manifest, whether he goes out or comes in, advances or withdraws, or undergoes transformation—none of this can unsettle his inner mind. Even when faced with thousands of external disturbances and physical or mental pains, he can overcome them with right mindfulness, expound the Dharma fearlessly, and not be swayed by suffering. The pure one is not influenced by contact; even when malicious contacts, words, or actions are directed toward him, the evil intention merely rebounds upon the foolish person and cannot harm the liberated one himself.

In teaching and guiding living beings, although he energetically engages in work for the welfare of others, he does not thereby lose his own state of liberation. Having gone beyond all fetters and attained complete inner freedom, his activity of teaching does not cause him to fall back into attachment; it is purely an expression of altruistic compassion. He can abide simultaneously in both guiding others and in liberation, benefiting himself and benefiting others alike.

III.3 The State and Explanation of Nirvāṇa and Parinirvāṇa  
When one asks about the state of a defilement-free, taintless liberated one after the end of his life, it should be understood as follows: the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness—are impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; and these elements of suffering, at the end of the liberated one’s life, are totally extinguished and come to rest. In other words, there is not some “consciousness” that goes somewhere else to abide; rather, consciousness itself has no basis of dependence and does not find any support, just like the complete non-abiding of final nirvāṇa (parinirvāṇa). This does not mean that consciousness transfers to another realm, but that saṃsāra itself has come to an end.

Nirvāṇa is not only the extinction of defilements but also the cessation of craving and of grasping. When the liberated one no longer clings to the aggregate of morality, the aggregate of concentration, the aggregate of wisdom, the aggregate of liberation, or the aggregate of knowledge and vision of liberation, this signifies that even attachment to the methods of practice and to liberation itself has been relinquished. The cessation of all habits of “taking up” is the ultimate aspect of nirvāṇa. “Liberation through non-grasping” means that the entire burden has been set down and one’s own welfare has been completely attained.

From the standpoint of the sequence of practice, when a practitioner, through hearing and rightly reflecting on the teaching, abandons wrong views and gains direct insight into truth, his mind can be freed from all defilements, with no attachment remaining. Once liberated from the five aggregates, he can further be liberated from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, thereby reaching ultimate liberation from suffering. Having seen this, the practitioner no longer undergoes rebirth in future lives. This is the true meaning expressed by nirvāṇa and parinirvāṇa.

IV. The Attainment, Realization, and Continuous Abiding of Liberation  

IV.1 The Fruits of Practice and Ultimate Accomplishment  
When a practitioner utterly cuts off the taints and realizes the fruition of arahantship, he is called one whose taints are destroyed, a “no-more-learner,” or one of ultimate liberation. He is born into the lineage of the Awakened One, realizes the unsurpassed truth, is endowed with all wisdom, sees through everything, and subdues and utterly destroys all unwholesome states. Because he has abandoned all attachment and dependence, he attains complete liberation, has extinguished all karmic forces, and is no longer entangled by any visible or invisible bonds.

Such a practitioner comes from a good family, leaves the household life for homelessness, carries out the unsurpassed holy life, and, in this very life, knows and realizes for himself. When he completes his practice, he deeply experiences and abides in the bliss of liberation. Since his taints are exhausted and his conduct is pure, free of all actions that could give rise to regret, his mind is tranquil, his virtues are complete, and he possesses all wholesome qualities. His heart has no fear, he attains quiet happiness, he can defeat the armies of Māra, is freed from the round of birth and death, reaches the end of suffering, and gains ultimate liberation.

Regarding the characteristics of liberation, such a practitioner “has nothing left to do” in the sense that all pursuits and fabrications of conditioned striving have ceased. Yet, on the other hand, “all that ought to be done has been accomplished”: all the required practices and tasks have been completely fulfilled. He has laid a firm foundation for liberation, reached the far shore, and is no longer shaken; he has transcended the stream of birth and death and accomplished the complete destruction of the taints. He does not attain accomplishment with a mind that chases after results; rather, in a state of non-seeking he naturally comes to fulfillment. This is the truly perfect state of “attaining without striving for attainment.”

When he reaches the fruition of arahantship, he is described as: “The holy life has been firmly established; what should be done has been done; the burden has been laid down; his own ultimate welfare has been obtained.” All bonds have been severed; he has become one of right awakening and complete liberation. Such a practitioner single-handedly accomplishes the supreme state, realizes a perfectly auspicious awakening, completes the pure holy life in this very life, utterly cuts off the round of birth and death, and attains the unsurpassed fruit of practice.

Certain sage-type (muni-type) liberated ones are further described as possessing innate endowments, keeping their hearts tranquil throughout day and night, harboring neither deceit nor desire, following the path of quietude trod by the wise, relying on nirvāṇa to extinguish all defilements, and calmly awaiting the final moment of parinirvāṇa. Even if defilements and Māra-obstacles were to arise again, they can still drive them away so that Māra’s host cannot find any path by which they attained liberation.

IV.2 The Arising of Liberating Knowledge and Ultimate Certainty  
At the moment of liberation, a special kind of wisdom necessarily arises, called “liberating knowledge.” This wisdom sometimes appears as a distinct awareness: “I am liberated.” This is not the resurgence of self-conceit, but a seeing-as-it-is that clearly knows that the round of birth and death has been completely terminated; the pure holy life has been perfectly established; what had to be cultivated has been fully completed; henceforth there will be no future round of birth and death, and he will no longer come to this world “in such a way.”

The essence of liberating knowledge lies in personally knowing that “birth is ended; the holy life has been established; what had to be done has been done; there is no more coming to any state of being.” The arising of this wisdom does not rely on any particular spoken formula or written phrase; it is based on a realistic knowledge of the law of cause and effect. When a practitioner is inwardly liberated, when all grasping has ceased, and he abides in right mindfulness, then the taints no longer continue to grow. In such a state he has transcended the self-identity view of “I,” and he no longer has any doubts about the taints, defilements, and liberation spoken of by the ascetic (the Buddha). He knows for certain that they have been totally extinguished.

This liberating knowledge often arises naturally in the midst of contemplation. When a noble disciple who has heard the teaching becomes disenchanted with eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and the feeling that arises dependent on mind-contact, all the way up to feelings that arise dependent on mind-contact; then from disenchantment comes dispassion, from dispassion comes liberation. At the very moment of liberation, liberating knowledge arises, certifying: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to this state of being.” When he becomes disenchanted with the six sense bases, then from disenchantment he becomes free from craving, from non-craving the mind is liberated; and at the moment of liberation, wisdom arises, ultimately realizing that the bonds of life have ended, the pure holy life has been completed, what ought to be done has been accomplished, and there will be no such rebirth again.

Elsewhere, this wisdom is also described as “the wisdom that accompanies the accomplishment of liberation,” “the true sphere of the knowledge that certifies liberation,” or “the ultimate verification of liberation.” Its content is nothing other than repeated confirmation that life has reached its ultimate fulfillment, that the pure practice has been completed, that all that should be done has been brought to completion, that there will be no later existence, and that one will no longer enter the round of rebirth. This wisdom cannot be granted by anyone else; it arises solely from the practitioner’s own direct experience and present-moment realization.

IV.3 The Continuity, Abiding, and Life-Mode of the Liberated State  
Liberation is not a temporary experience but a state in which one can abide for a long time. Because the mind has been liberated, the practitioner can continually abide in liberation; the heart is naturally content and free from fear. Since consciousness no longer depends on external conditions in search of pleasure, even if he obtains no material requisites, he is still happy to dwell in the present, like the luminous-beings (Abhassara devas) who feed on joy; inner joy becomes his stable nourishment. That the mind does not seek joy in external things shows that he has truly transcended the constraints of material and external conditions.

In such a state, he follows the path day and night; his resolve is firm; he constantly delights in meditative contemplation; he quietly dwells alone, not negligent, ardently persevering. Since the root of sorrow and distress has been thoroughly uprooted, his heart bears no trace of guilt or grief, and he has relinquished desire for any form of existence. In this very life, he manifests the supreme holy life to its ultimate completion, possesses for himself knowledge and direct realization, and knows that birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.

When the mind abides in right mindfulness, the taints no longer continue to grow. The heart has attained freedom and is not moved by external conditions; even when a thousand intrusions arise, he does not give rise to the slightest fear. In this day-and-night abiding there is no remorse and no affliction, only the concrete experience of quiet happiness. In daily life he personally knows and abides in the complete state of liberation, personally experiencing taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, dwelling in full perfection, and becoming one whom the gods look up to from afar and upon whom they rely.

V. The Foundations of Practice for Liberation, Its Universal Principles, and Criteria of Verification  

V.1 Right Dharma, Contemplation, and the Fundamental Principles of Liberation  
Liberation is established on the thorough understanding and practice of the right Dharma. The liberated one has cut off all bonds of existence and fully knows and practices the right Dharma. The core content of the right Dharma is the complete extinction of name-and-form without remainder—that is, all modes of existence that depend on the compounds of body, mind, and consciousness are no longer appropriated. This principle applies to all who seek liberation; anyone who practices in accordance with it can cut off the fetters of existence and finally attain ultimate liberation from further birth.

The object of liberation is the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness; and the method of liberation is to cease grasping at these five aggregates. Through disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to the five aggregates, the practitioner attains liberation. In the concrete course of practice, his attitude toward the five aggregates begins from “decreasing rather than increasing; forsaking rather than taking; retreating rather than approaching; distancing from the perfuming influence rather than being completely perfumed by it,” and gradually shifts to “neither increasing nor decreasing; neither forsaking nor taking; neither retreating nor approaching; neither distancing from the perfuming nor being fully perfumed,” until finally he abides in the state of “they have already decreased, already been forsaken, already retreated, already been freed from perfuming.” This indicates that his attachment and dependence on the five aggregates have been completely loosened and disappeared.

By means of such contemplation, the practitioner can thoroughly understand the five aggregates. Having been liberated from the five aggregates, he can further be liberated from birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, thereby reaching ultimate liberation from suffering. The contemplation of disenchantment not only brings about revulsion toward the five aggregates but also leads beyond the entire existence of “having a body.” In the end, he no longer undergoes rebirth in future lives: birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being—this becomes an actual personal experience.

When a noble disciple hears the teaching, at first he can know as it really is that this body is impermanent, and then, based on understanding impermanence, he transcends attachment to “having a body” and gains liberation. Through correctly hearing and reflecting on the teaching, he abandons wrong views and gains direct insight into truth; his heart is freed from all defilements, with no attachment remaining. This course is precisely the function of the teaching and the concrete manifestation of beings’ awakening.

V.2 The Fruits of the Systems of Faculties, Factors of Awakening, and Bases of Spiritual Power  
In the system of practice, the five spiritual faculties, the Seven Factors of Awakening, and the Four Bases of Spiritual Power are all important provisions on the path to liberation. One who cultivates the five faculties and repeatedly puts them into practice can reach the state of complete destruction of the taints and attain taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, personally knowing and realizing it in this very life, and abiding in a complete state.

When the teaching he previously heard is realized in his own experience, the practitioner directly contemplates and penetrates the truth by wisdom, thereby giving rise to firm and unshakable ultimate confidence. At that time this confidence becomes the fundamental “faculty of faith.” At the stage of no-more-learning (arahantship), the practitioner understands the five faculties and has personally touched their ultimate goal and fruit. He can contemplate and penetrate them with wisdom, and he also clearly knows that the six sense bases of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind will be utterly extinguished without remainder and will not arise elsewhere.

Among the five faculties, the faculty of wisdom holds a particularly crucial position. By cultivating and deepening the faculty of wisdom, one can accomplish taintless liberation, thereby personally knowing that life has ended, the holy life has been established, what needed to be done has been accomplished, and there will be no further round of birth and death. If he further cultivates the two (higher) faculties, his defilements can be completely extinguished, and in this very life he can realize liberation; pure practice is complete, the round of birth and death is ended, and he can personally certify the state of liberation, gaining the ultimate fruit in this life.

The cultivation of the Seven Factors of Awakening can free the mind from the three bonds of the taints of sensuality, existence, and ignorance. When the mind is liberated, there arises the wisdom “I am liberated,” along with the knowledge that the stream of birth-and-death has ended, the pure practice has been firmly established, what ought to be done has been completed, and there will be no future cycle of birth and death. Through the complete cultivation of the Seven Factors of Awakening, wisdom and liberation are both brought to perfection.

The cultivation of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power (idhipāda) can further expand into vast and great merit. When the practitioner repeatedly cultivates the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, he can bring about the complete destruction of the taints, realize taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, personally knowing and realizing them in this very life, and abiding in completeness. He can cut off all defilements, realize defilement-free liberation, and personally experience and abide in this state in his present life. As cultivation deepens, the taints are completely exhausted, and liberation is firmly established in body and mind.

In addition, in the system of the nine successive liberations, there is a specific explanation of the gradations of liberation. “Liberation that has enjoyment as its food” is related to the realm of form; “liberation that has no enjoyment as its food” is related to the formless; and “liberation that has no enjoyment whatsoever as its food” arises by contemplating the mind that is already freed from sensual desire, freed from hatred, and freed from delusion, producing a still higher liberation. When the practitioner focuses on contemplating the mind freed from sensual desire, the mind freed from hatred, and the mind freed from delusion, what he sees is a mind whose taints are exhausted; this is precisely the hallmark of ultimate liberation.

V.3 The Criteria for Examining the Liberated State and Its Noble Titles  
To examine whether a practitioner has fully attained liberation, one can observe from many aspects. The characteristic of one whose practice is complete is that the taints are exhausted, his conduct is pure, his mind is tranquil, his virtues are complete, and he possesses all wholesome qualities. His mind is free from the fetters of defilements and the piercing pain of attachment; he constantly maintains quiet happiness and keeps body and mind well settled. One who is pure has no evil or defilement; his consciousness is pure and unstained, tranquil and free from anger, with no vexation and no craving. He harbors no violence toward either the weak or the strong; his morality is perfect like a well-trained elephant; his mind has attained ultimate liberation and reached a state with no basis of attachment.

In terms of levels of practice, the one of ultimate liberation is called “one who has attained the liberation of the destruction of the taints.” The holy life has been completely accomplished; the burden has been laid down; the ultimate welfare has been attained; all bonds have been utterly severed; and he has obtained right knowledge and complete liberation. He is called “one who has attained seeing,” “one who has attained the true Dharma,” and “one who has seen the true Dharma.” He is endowed with the wisdom of a learner and the illumination of a learner, has fulfilled the holy, clear, penetrating wisdom, has entered the stream of truth, and established the door to the deathless. On a still higher level, he is called “a person of the last body,” indicating that this is his final lifetime and that there will be no future rebirth in saṃsāra.

On the level of wisdom, he possesses two kinds of liberating wisdom: first, right knowledge, representing correct and complete wisdom; second, right liberation, representing correct and complete deliverance. When greed, hatred, and delusion are utterly extinguished, this is the concrete manifestation of complete cognition. Through such perfect knowledge and practice, the practitioner finally attains liberation and will no longer undergo rebirth in future lives.

Regarding his relations with others, such a mind-liberated one is described as “one whom the gods look up to from afar and upon whom they rely,” because even beings in the heavenly realms take his liberated state as their place of refuge. As for sensory contact, although he fully possesses the sense faculties and meets their objects, his mind remains free of sensual desire. This is precisely the state of well-attained liberation of mind. He can thoroughly understand all feelings, reach the law of the far shore of supreme wisdom, know the nature of suffering, personally see the truth in this very life, and attain freedom from taints, so that after the body breaks up he no longer enters saṃsāra.

In summary, when a practitioner, through observation and practice, completely understands the nature of body, mind, and the world, his mind attains complete liberation, and this life becomes his last existence, with no further rebirth in the future. He certifies that birth is ended, the holy life has been completed, what ought to be done has been accomplished, and he will not come here again in such a way. At this point, the two qualities of “knowledge (illumination)” and “liberation” are both perfect; right knowledge and right liberation are fully possessed. He has become a true arahant and one of ultimate liberation.
