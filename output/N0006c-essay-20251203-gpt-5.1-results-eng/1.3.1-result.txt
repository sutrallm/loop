<title> Dependent Origination, the Nature of Name-and-Form and the Five Aggregates, and the Path to Liberation </title>
<article>
I. The Dependent-Origination Structure of Name-and-Form and Body-and-Mind

Name-and-form is the basic structure of bodily-and-mental existence. “Name” refers to all mental and psychological phenomena, including mental factors such as feeling, perception, volition/thinking, contact, and attention. It may be taken collectively as the various mental phenomena, or as the functions of mind, mentality, and consciousness. “Form” refers to the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and air—and all material things that arise in dependence on the combination of these four great elements. Mentality and materiality together are called name-and-form (nāma‑rūpa). Name-and-form does not exist independently with its own self-nature, but arises dependently on conditions; it must rely on consciousness in order to arise. Therefore consciousness is the fundamental cause, source, origin, and starting point of name-and-form.

The body itself likewise arises and perishes entirely in dependence on causal conditions, and is not created by some real “self” or “other person.” What is conventionally called a “sentient being” is actually just a designation imputed onto the aggregation of five types of elements, with no independently existing entity to be found. These five aggregates are form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness; when they are gathered together, ordinary people call this “I” or a “being.”

In the forward course of dependent origination, name-and-form arises conditioned by consciousness, and consciousness in turn abides dependent on name-and-form. They condition each other, driving the continuing round of birth and death. However, where the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and air—completely cease, the conditions that drive this turning likewise come to an end, name-and-form is utterly extinguished, and the round stops. If a practitioner can in actual practice bring name-and-form to an end and cut off all obstructions and delusive attachment to forms, then all fetters will be completely severed, and the practitioner will reach the state that transcends name-and-form.

II. The True State of the Body, the Sense Faculties, and Feelings

The human body, made of the four great elements, is by nature fragile and easily destroyed, inwardly and outwardly foul and impure. It is bound to grow, decline, be acquired, be abandoned, and in the end be eroded, eaten away, damaged, and destroyed. This body is fundamentally covered over by all kinds of diseases and impurities; it is impossible for it truly to be free of illness. Thus “a body without disease” is, at root, unattainable. By contrast, the mind need not fall ill in step with the suffering of the body. What a practitioner should learn is that even when the body is sick, the mind need not give rise to mental disease and suffering along with it, but can remain clear, bright, and liberated.

This present body, and the thinking and feelings occurring right now, are all produced and drawn in by past karmic actions; they are not something that anyone can truly “possess.” When faced with the physical body composed of the four great elements, ordinary people are often able to feel revulsion and disenchantment, wishing to be liberated from it, because the body is visible, grows old, deteriorates, and can be taken and discarded. However, with regard to the invisible, rapidly changing mental phenomena of mind, mentality, or consciousness, it is much more difficult for ordinary people to generate the same kind of revulsion and disenchantment, and even harder to become liberated from them. The root reason is that ordinary people have long harbored the notion of “what is mine,” clinging to “this is mine, this I am, this is my self.” Although they may sometimes see impermanence and decay in the physical body, they still cling tightly to consciousness and will not let go.

Although the physical body is fragile, it can still persist in time for a year, two years, or even a hundred years or more. Mental phenomena referred to as mind, mentality, or consciousness, however, are changing day and night without pause, arising and ceasing in various different modes, constantly flowing and transforming from instant to instant. Precisely because of this, if one only relies on surface impressions without examining with wisdom, one may instead form a deeper identification and clinging toward this ever-changing consciousness.

The body is also likened to a city: formed of the four great elements, it is an impermanent phenomenon, destined to be eaten away, worn down, damaged, and destroyed. In a broader view, all material phenomena, feelings, perceptions, volitional formations, cognitive discriminations, and everything that is seen, heard, thought, known, obtained, sought, or even inwardly investigated—all of these are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.

III. The Structure and Scope of the Five Aggregates and the Five Aggregates of Clinging

What constitutes the existence of life are five basic factors known as the five aggregates: form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. 

The aggregate of form is the domain of materiality and body—that is, all material phenomena and material forms, including all material qualities of the internal body and the external world, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: all are included within it. Form is so called because this kind of materiality can be damaged and broken by afflictive stimuli such as cold, heat, hunger, thirst, insects, and snakes; under pressure from external conditions it changes and decays.

The aggregate of feeling is the domain of feeling; that is, all functions and phenomena of feeling. It is called “feeling” because it receives and experiences painful feeling, pleasant feeling, and neutral feeling, bearing the various sensations of body and mind.

The aggregate of perception is the domain of conceptualization and recognition, that is, the recognition of various appearances and the formation of concepts. It is called “perception” because it can discriminate various appearances such as blue, yellow, red, and white, and establish memories and marks regarding the objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and ideas, thereby forming various conceptual cognitions.

The aggregate of formations is the domain of volition and activity, that is, all intentions of mind and mental activities of will. It is called “formations” because it drives all conditioned phenomena—including form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—into activity, propelling all bodily, verbal, and mental actions. It is the driving force behind behavior and karmic action.

The aggregate of consciousness is the domain of discernment and awareness, that is, the function of discriminating and cognizing. It is called “consciousness” because it can distinguish such tastes as sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, harsh, non-harsh, salty, and non-salty, as well as all other objects. It manifests concretely as six types of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness.

The scope of the five aggregates is extremely broad. All forms, feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousnesses encompass past, future, and present, and include all modes such as internal and external, coarse and subtle, inferior and superior, far and near. The five aggregates are what ought to be thoroughly known, and are the very contents that practitioners must examine. A bhikkhu should analyze the actual nature of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. By deeply observing all bodily-and-mental phenomena that he formerly clung to as “I,” “mine,” and “my self,” he can come to know them as they really are: deceptive and unreal.

When these five basic factors are combined with defilements and become objects of clinging, they are called the five aggregates of clinging. In scope, the five aggregates of clinging are completely identical to the five aggregates: form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. The term “aggregates of clinging” emphasizes that these factors have become bound up with defilements, entering a state of “with outflows, subject to grasping”—that is, they have been polluted by desire, craving, attachment, thirst, fever, and various defilements, and have become objects of attachment and bondage.

Within the five aggregates of clinging, the aggregate of clinging to form consists of material phenomena that have the nature of defilement and can be clung to. It is composed of the four great elements and the material things derived from the four great elements, comprising all internal and external forms, coarse or subtle, far or near, and it arises dependent on the gathering of “food” and ceases as that “food” ceases. The aggregate of clinging to feeling consists of experiential feelings that have the nature of defilement and can be clung to. It is composed of six kinds of feeling: painful, pleasant, and neutral feelings arising from eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact. The aggregate of clinging to perception consists of conceptual cognitions that have the nature of defilement and can be clung to, formed from all cognitions of the six sense objects—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and ideas. The aggregate of clinging to formations consists of various volitional thoughts and intentions that have the nature of defilement and can be clung to, constituted by the six types of thinking and willing directed toward forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and ideas. The aggregate of clinging to consciousness consists of discriminative operations that have the nature of defilement and can be clung to, built up from the six types of consciousness—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness. It arises dependent on the gathering of contact and ceases as contact ceases; ultimately it also altogether ceases along with the cessation of name-and-form.

Both the five aggregates and the five aggregates of clinging are the basis upon which the notions of “self” and “sentient beings” are constructed. When desire, greed, delight, and love arise toward the five aggregates, they become the five aggregates of clinging. This very clinging is the cause of suffering, and it forms the concept of “sentient beings” and the bondage “like a net of existence” that tightly binds individuals to the cycle of birth and death. An uninstructed ordinary person clings to form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as “what is mine,” “what I am,” and “my essence.” In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, all behavior proceeds in conformity with the five aggregates of clinging. This clinging and abiding is called “letting consciousness dwell in the house”: so long as consciousness is attached to the four domains of form, feeling, perception, and formations, it is as if dwelling in a house, imprisoned by the five aggregates.

IV. Multiple Properties of the Five Aggregates and Their Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-Self

The fundamental characteristic of the five aggregates is that they are all impermanent. Among all forms, feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousnesses—past, future, and present—not a single phenomenon is permanent, lasting, eternally abiding, or unchanging; within the five aggregates there is no part that is always unalterable. Therefore form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are all impermanent. This very nature of impermanence is suffering, and the nature of suffering is non-self. Whatever is impermanent and subject to decay brings pressure and unease, and is therefore suffering. Whatever belongs to the domain of suffering must in its nature be non-self. From this we know that all five aggregates are impermanent, suffering, and non-self; they are neither “I,” nor “what is mine,” nor “my essence,” and should not be regarded as a real, unchanging self.

This relationship can be understood from multiple angles. Because the five aggregates are impermanent, their nature is suffering; because they are impermanent and suffering, they cannot truly be “self.” The five aggregates are not only impermanent and suffering, but they are all phenomena of change, constantly shifting, unable to abide eternally in one state. Therefore, regarding these impermanent, suffering, and changeable five aggregates, one should not maintain any thought such as “this is what is mine,” “this I am,” or “this is my essence.” Whatever is impermanent, suffering, and subject to deterioration should never be taken as “this is what is mine,” “this I am,” or “this is my self.”

The five aggregates are also described as blazing phenomena. Form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are all like fierce flames, burning intensely and oppressing sentient beings. Thus the very nature of the five aggregates is suffering; they are accompanied by suffering and not by true happiness, and long-term observation will naturally give rise to a sense of weariness and revulsion. Furthermore, the five aggregates possess multiple attributes: they are Māra and the phenomena of Māra, capable of binding sentient beings; they are impermanent and phenomena of impermanence, changing from moment to moment; they are suffering and phenomena of suffering, bringing pressure and anxiety; they are non-self and phenomena of non-self, within which no controller can be found. The five aggregates are also “phenomena of cessation” and “phenomena of destruction,” for they ultimately come to an end and must be destroyed; they are “phenomena of accumulation,” arising from the coming together of conditions; and they are “phenomena of cessation,” bound sooner or later to die out. All of the five aggregates, without exception, share these same characteristics, and therefore no aggregate should be clung to as permanent, blissful, self, or pure.

Because the five aggregates are impermanent, suffering, changeable, and subject to destruction, they are all conditioned phenomena produced from causal conditions, and are ultimately destined to disperse and perish. Within the five aggregates there is no eternal, unchanging “self”; they themselves are conditioned phenomena, indeed phenomena due to be destroyed, and phenomena that are harmful. The wise in the world, when observing form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, do not regard them as permanent, lasting, eternally abiding, or unchanging; the Tathāgata likewise proclaims this. The wise of the world see them as impermanent, suffering, and changing phenomena; the Tathāgata also directly sees them in this way and teaches accordingly. From this perspective, form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are worldly phenomena, not entities that transcend the world.

Looking more deeply, the five aggregates are further likened to illusions. When all phenomena are examined in accordance with reality, the conclusion is that they are “without anything, without reality, without solidity”—this is true of past, future, and present, whether near or far, in all times and spaces. The aggregate of form is like a mass of foam on the Ganges: though it seems like a clump, it arises and ceases immediately, dispersing at a touch; upon examination no solid substance can be found. The aggregate of perception is like a mirage in hot weather: shifting and unreal, seemingly existent from afar but empty on close inspection, ultimately with no real content. The aggregate of formations is like the trunk of a banana tree: when peeled layer by layer, one finds no true core within, only one layer of false combination after another. From these similes we can see that the five aggregates themselves are deceptive and without any solid entity.

The five aggregates are also called “Māra” or “phenomena of Māra,” because they are the primary objects that bind and delude beings. Form is Māra and a phenomenon of Māra; feeling is Māra and a phenomenon of Māra; perception is Māra and a phenomenon of Māra; formations are Māra and phenomena of Māra; consciousness is also Māra and a phenomenon of Māra. At the same time, each aggregate is non-self and a phenomenon of non-self: form is non-self and a phenomenon of non-self; feeling is non-self and a phenomenon of non-self; perception is non-self and a phenomenon of non-self; formations are non-self and phenomena of non-self; consciousness is likewise non-self and a phenomenon of non-self. In this light, a practitioner should no longer regard these impermanent, suffering, changing, and deceptive five aggregates as “what is mine,” “what I am,” or “my essence.”

The five aggregates furthermore have multiple characteristics: Māra, impermanence, suffering, non-self, phenomena of cessation, phenomena of destruction, phenomena of accumulation, and phenomena of extinction. These features apply universally to each aggregate. Whoever can directly observe these true features of the five aggregates, and no longer clings to any aggregate as permanent, blissful, self, or pure, will gradually distance themselves from bondage and move toward liberation.

The relationship between the five aggregates and the Tathāgata is also clearly stated: form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are not the Tathāgata; the Tathāgata is not in form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness; nor is the Tathāgata found apart from form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. This shows that the Tathāgata’s realization has gone beyond any grasping and identification with the five aggregates, and is no longer limited by them.

The five aggregates are at once “phenomena of accumulation” and “phenomena of cessation”: they come together through conditions, and inevitably cease as conditions cease. From the perspective of “arising and ceasing,” each aggregate has these two sides—accumulation and cessation. From the perspective of “suffering,” the five aggregates themselves are suffering, and whatever belongs to the domain of suffering is by nature non-self and must be approached with the attitude: “This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.”

The same holds for the five aggregates of clinging. Form as an aggregate of clinging, feeling as an aggregate of clinging, perception as an aggregate of clinging, formations as an aggregate of clinging, and consciousness as an aggregate of clinging—together called the five aggregates of clinging—are the very root of suffering. Unless one fully and directly knows the nature of each aggregate of clinging, the cause of its arising, the state of its cessation, and the path of practice leading to its cessation, one cannot attain unsurpassed perfect awakening.

V. Wrong Clinging to the Five Aggregates and the Ignorance of Ordinary People

The fundamental predicament of ordinary people lies in their ignorance and distortion regarding the true nature of the five aggregates. Ignorance first manifests as a lack of accurate knowledge about the five aggregates: not knowing their nature, not knowing the cause of their arising, not knowing their cessation, and not knowing the path that leads to their cessation. In addition, ignorance shows itself in an inability to see truthfully the arising of the five aggregates, their cessation, and the overall relationship between arising and ceasing; such a person cannot clearly see how the five aggregates arise, how they are extinguished, and what their “nature of arising, of ceasing, and of arising-and-ceasing” is.

Because an uninstructed ordinary person does not associate with noble ones and does not learn and practice the noble ones’ true teaching, he develops an entire system of erroneous cognition concerning the five aggregates. He is ignorant of the five aggregates’ nature, of the cause of their arising, of the methods for their elimination, and of the path leading to that elimination. He is also ignorant of their arising, their ceasing, their temporary pleasures, their latent dangers, and their complete escape. This ignorance is concretely expressed in many ways: he is unknowing and unseeing, unable to directly experience, unable to thoroughly understand, unable to fully penetrate, unable to view evenly, unable to continuously observe and closely attend, and incapable of even-handed and close investigation; consequently, he naturally fails to directly see reality. These various cognitive defects are present in every domain of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—and they directly lead to all sorts of extreme views and wrong views in the world.

In concrete forms of clinging, the uninstructed ordinary person generates four types of erroneous views about the five aggregates: that the five aggregates are the “self”; that the “self” possesses the five aggregates; that the “self” is within the five aggregates; and that the five aggregates are within the “self.” If these four erroneous views are applied separately to each aggregate, yet more fine-grained clinging arises: with regard to the aggregate of form, one believes that form is the self, that “I have form,” that “I am in form,” and that “form is in me.” With regard to feeling, one believes that feeling is the self, that “I have feeling,” that “I am in feeling,” and that “feeling is in me.” With regard to perception, one believes that perception is the self, that “I have perception,” that “I am in perception,” and that “perception is in me.” With regard to formations, one believes that formations are the self, that “I have formations,” that “I am in formations,” and that “formations are in me.” With regard to consciousness, one believes that consciousness is the self, that “I have consciousness,” that “I am in consciousness,” and that “consciousness is in me.” These mistaken cognitions prevent ordinary people from generating disenchantment and liberation with respect to mind, mentality, and consciousness, and instead make their clinging even deeper.

On another level, ordinary people also use the five aggregates to compare superiority and inferiority. If one takes these impermanent, suffering, and changeable aggregates as “I am superior,” “I am equal,” or “I am inferior,” this likewise shows a failure to see reality. Only when a person no longer uses these impermanent, suffering, changing five aggregates as the basis for views of “I am superior,” “I am equal,” or “I am inferior” can it be said that he sees as it really is.

There is also a concrete description of abiding in the aggregates: if a person abides in form, abides in feeling, abides in perception, abides in formations, or abides in consciousness, this means that he has generated clinging and dependence upon these five aggregates. Especially when he takes form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as objects of pleasure, joy, and happiness, and cannot know as it really is the ending of consciousness, then he easily gives rise to all kinds of wrong views concerning the “post-mortem state.”

These clingings directly give rise to fear and wrong views. Because there is the existence of form, and because one clings to and loves form, various strange wrong views arise—for example, believing that “the wind does not blow, rivers do not flow, pregnancy does not lead to birth, the sun and moon neither rise nor set, but stand still like pillars,” or believing that “after death, there is a self that is neither suffering nor happiness, a self without illness.” Likewise, because feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness exist and are clung to and loved, the same types of wrong views arise.

In the question of death and the Tathāgata’s state after death, this ignorance and clinging concerning the five aggregates is also the root cause. A person who cannot see form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as they really are, and who does not know as it really is the arising and ending of the five aggregates or the path that leads to their ending, will generate four fixed views about the Tathāgata’s state after death: that the Tathāgata exists after death; that he does not exist after death; that he both exists and does not exist after death; or that he neither exists nor does not exist after death. Conversely, if one can know as it really is form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, and know as it really is the arising and ending of the five aggregates and the path toward their ending, then one will not generate these four attachments. Therefore the reason the Tathāgata does not declare how the Tathāgata ultimately is after death is precisely that whether these views arise depends on whether one has accurate knowledge of the five aggregates.

VI. The Noble Disciple’s Right Knowledge, Clear Seeing, and Comprehensive Insight into the Five Aggregates

In contrast to the ignorance of ordinary people, the instructed noble disciple represents “clear knowing.” Clear knowing means having accurate understanding of the true nature of the five aggregates. When a person associates with noble ones and good spiritual friends, and learns and practices the noble ones’ teaching, he can then see as it really is the various laws governing the five aggregates. This includes knowing the nature of the five aggregates, the causes of their arising, the methods of their cessation, and the path that leads to their cessation, as well as knowing the phenomena of their arising, their cessation, and the overall relationship between arising and ceasing.

More concretely, an instructed noble disciple can accurately know the truth of the five aggregates in “five core aspects”: he knows how the five aggregates arise, how they cease, where their allure lies, where their danger lies, and how to escape from them. These five aspects apply universally to each aggregate—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. The uninstructed ordinary person cannot accurately know any of these five aspects, whereas the instructed noble disciple can see each one of them accurately in every aggregate.

Therefore the instructed noble disciple does not cling to the five aggregates as “self,” nor does he think that the “self” possesses the five aggregates, or that the “self” is in the five aggregates, or that the five aggregates are in the “self.” He does not generate, with regard to the aggregate of form, the views “form is my self, I possess form, I am in form, form is in me”; likewise, with regard to feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, he does not generate views such as “feeling is my self, I possess feeling, I am in feeling, feeling is in me,” and so forth. The instructed noble disciple no longer uses the five aggregates as the basis of self-identity, but rather knows as it really is that the five aggregates are impermanent, suffering, and non-self, are conditioned phenomena, and are harmful. He knows that the five aggregates are only conditionally arisen phenomena destined to be destroyed, and therefore, regarding these changing phenomena, he no longer hesitates or doubts, and no longer has any desire, greed, or attachment toward their changing nature.

On this foundation, the instructed noble disciple further learns and follows the Tathāgata’s teaching, understanding the full meaning of “clear knowing”: clear knowing is comprehensive insight into the five aggregates, which are form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. With correct wisdom, he observes the five aggregates as impermanent, suffering, non-self, conditioned, and destined to break up, and he can see as it really is the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates. He sees the temporary pleasures and allure that the aggregates present, penetrates the latent dangers and harms within them, and grasps the means by which to completely escape from them.

Accordingly, regarding the five aggregates of clinging, the instructed noble disciple fully knows them in four crucial aspects: first, he knows the nature of each aggregate of clinging; second, he knows the cause for the arising of each aggregate of clinging; third, he knows the state of cessation of each aggregate of clinging; and fourth, he knows the path of practice leading to the cessation of each aggregate of clinging. He clearly knows that, apart from the aggregate of clinging to form—arising dependent on the gathering of food and ceasing as food ceases—the other four aggregates of clinging—feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—arise dependent on the gathering of contact and cease as contact ceases. Among them, the aggregate of clinging to consciousness is utterly extinguished when name-and-form ceases. And the path leading to the cessation of all five aggregates of clinging is the Noble Eightfold Path.

The basic criterion of accomplished practice is possession of “four kinds of knowledge” concerning the five aggregates and the five aggregates of clinging: knowing their nature, knowing the causes of their arising, knowing how they cease, and knowing the practical path that leads to their cessation. When these four types of knowledge are complete, one can attain unsurpassed perfect awakening.

VII. Taming Craving, Right Contemplation of the Five Aggregates, and the Three Marks

The core doctrinal thrust of the Tathāgata’s teaching is to tame desire and craving toward the five aggregates. The five aggregates are form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. So long as there remains attachment, desire, love, thirst, fever, and craving toward any one aggregate, when that aggregate alters and changes, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair will arise. Conversely, if one can be free of attachment, desire, love, and craving toward any aggregate, then when that aggregate changes, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair will not arise. Therefore one must tame craving for the five aggregates in order to prevent suffering at its root.

In actual practice, one should first understand the nature of the five aggregates: the aggregate of form is the domain of material shape and material phenomena; the aggregate of feeling is the domain of experiential sensation and the operation of feeling; the aggregate of perception is the domain of conceptual cognition and the formation of concepts; the aggregate of formations is the domain of volitional activity and intention; the aggregate of consciousness is the domain of discriminative awareness and cognitive recognition. Further, one must understand that each of the five aggregates bears the three marks: form is impermanent, suffering, and non-self; feeling is impermanent, suffering, and non-self; perception is impermanent, suffering, and non-self; formations are impermanent, suffering, and non-self; consciousness is likewise impermanent, suffering, and non-self.

In contemplative practice, one should observe the five aggregates with right wisdom as they really are: with right wisdom see form as impermanent, suffering, and non-self; with right wisdom see feeling as impermanent, suffering, and non-self; with right wisdom see perception as impermanent, suffering, and non-self; with right wisdom see formations as impermanent, suffering, and non-self; with right wisdom see consciousness as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. When such impermanent and suffering phenomena are clearly seen, one should no longer regard them as “self,” nor cling to them as “this is mine,” “this I am,” or “this is my self.” For whatever is impermanent and suffering should not be taken as “self.”

This contemplation is not limited to any one time or place, but extends to all forms, feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousnesses, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near. Toward them all, one should see with right wisdom that “this is not mine, this I am not, this is not my essence.” Only by universally applying such contemplative wisdom to the five aggregates can one genuinely establish right view of non-self.

VIII. Right View of Non-Self and “This Is Not Mine, This I Am Not, This Is Not My Self”

Within the correct contemplation of non-self, there is a central formula that should be repeatedly applied: “This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.” Regarding all five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—one should contemplate with right wisdom: this is not what I own, this is not what I am, this is not my essence. Likewise, all phenomena should be recognized as “not self, not what is mine, not my self”; one should no longer consider any impermanent, suffering, and decaying phenomenon as “my possession,” “me,” or “my self.”

This principle applies not only to the five aggregates but extends to all internal and external six sense bases and related phenomena. Regarding the internal six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—one should see that they are all non-self; and regarding the external six sense fields—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and ideas—one should likewise see them as non-self. Going further, for the six sense faculties, six sense objects, six consciousnesses, six contacts, and all feelings arising from them, one should also contemplate them as non-self. This contemplation of non-self ought to be applied universally to all elements that constitute experience, including all form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, together with their associated sense faculties and objects.

On the basis of not believing that “I am the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind,” and not believing that “the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind belong to me,” the practitioner applies the right view of non-self to the six faculties, eradicating clinging to “self” and “what is mine” in connection with the six sense faculties. Then, even when the destruction of the body is faced in the future, the mind can still remain calm and liberated.

At the same time, the practitioner should also widely apply this contemplation of non-self to the six types of perception and the six types of thinking. The six types of perception are perception of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and ideas—that is, the various cognitions and appearances that arise in relation to the six objects. The six types of thinking are thinking about forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and ideas—various thoughts and volitions that arise toward these six objects. These perceptions and thoughts are likewise parts of the five aggregates. They too are impermanent, suffering, and non-self, changing phenomena; hence they should be approached with the attitude, “This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.”

When, with such correct wisdom, one observes the five aggregates and all phenomena as they really are, one can completely cut off clinging toward the future and thereby bring the flow of birth and death to rest. This observation is not merely theoretical; it must be realized through repeated direct contemplation, gradually transforming the mind’s fixation on “self” and “what is mine.”

IX. Bodily and Mental Suffering, the Three Kinds of Suffering, and the Truth of Feeling

Concerning the domain of suffering, it is necessary to distinguish between bodily illness and mental illness. The body is by its very nature covered over by diseases and impurities, and can never truly be free from illness; therefore physical pain is unavoidable. The mind, however, can remain independent of the body’s state of illness, staying free from disease. The key point in practice is that, when the body is ill, one’s mind can nonetheless remain free from mental sickness and not be dragged around by physical pain, but abide in liberation.

Our attitude toward feelings also requires a complete transformation. From the ultimate perspective, the nature of all feelings is suffering. A practitioner should first clearly understand this truth, and then, with wisdom, verify that all these feelings are decaying, deceptive, and unreal phenomena. Whether painful, pleasant, or neutral, no feeling can abide permanently. If clung to as happiness or as “what is mine,” it inevitably leads to disappointment and distress.

In this connection, one must also understand three types of suffering: the suffering of suffering, the suffering of formations, and the suffering of change. These are different ways of analyzing suffering, showing its multiple layers within all conditioned phenomena. What ought to be rightly understood in full consists of four aspects: suffering itself, the arising of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. Ignorance of these four is among the core definitions of ignorance.

X. Dependent Origination, the Cessation of Name-and-Form, and Not Dwelling in the House

In the teaching of dependent origination, name-and-form and consciousness condition one another, driving the turning of the cycle of birth and death. Name-and-form arises with consciousness as its fundamental condition, and consciousness abides dependent on name-and-form, thus forming the continuous stream of existence. This process of turning is directly connected to the practice of “transcending name-and-form”: when a practitioner can bring name-and-form to an end, cut off attachment to forms, and utterly dissolve in the mind all clinging to the four great elements, then where the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and air—cease, the turning stops, and name-and-form is extinguished without remainder.

In this process, “not dwelling in the house” is an important concept. “Dwelling in the house” means that when consciousness is attached to the four domains of form, feeling, perception, and formations, it is said to dwell in a house, being confined by the five aggregates. Only when consciousness no longer dwells in form, feeling, perception, and formations, but can function freely without constraint, can it be said to have truly left the house of the five aggregates.

At the same time, understanding the “four elements in their three aspects” is also crucial. If one can know these four elements and their threefold characteristics as they really are, one can attain unsurpassed complete awakening and achieve unshakable liberation of mind, with no further becoming. If one cannot know them as they really are, one cannot achieve unsurpassed complete awakening and cannot be freed from birth and death. One who does not know the four elements and their three aspects cannot be considered a true practitioner, and cannot personally realize the truth; only one who knows them can rightly be called a genuine practitioner and a direct witness of the truth. Moreover, full knowledge regarding each element must include four aspects: knowing its nature, knowing the cause of its arising, knowing the method of its cessation, and knowing the practical path that leads to its cessation.

XI. Methods of Observing the Five Aggregates: Arising-and-Cessation, Allure, Danger, and Escape

One of the core contents of the Tathāgata’s teaching is the explanation of the nature, origin, and cessation of the five aggregates, and the indication that the Noble Eightfold Path is the road leading to the cessation of suffering. A practitioner should cultivate concentration, and while entering concentration, should clearly know the arising and cessation of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. This is also the essential doctrine of solitary, quiet practice: to know as it really is the arising and passing away of the five aggregates, to see how the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness arise and how they cease.

There are several necessary aspects when observing the five aggregates. First, one must know their arising, that is, under what conditions they come into being. Second, one must know their cessation, understanding under what conditions they come to an end. Next, one must clearly see their allure and flavor—the temporary pleasures and seductive aspects that they bring. Then one must penetrate their danger and drawbacks, seeing the suffering and bondage they contain. Finally, one must grasp the method to escape from the five aggregates, knowing the concrete path of practice.

The uninstructed ordinary person cannot see as it really is the arising, cessation, allure, danger, or escape from the five aggregates. The instructed noble disciple, however, can see these five aspects accurately in each aggregate. The same applies to the five aggregates of clinging: one should clearly know their arising and cessation, understand the allure (pleasant feeling) and danger (painful feeling) associated with them, and master the way to escape from them.

This observation is not a one-time exercise in discursive thought; it must be developed through long-term, even-handed, and close observation and investigation, gradually forming a clear understanding. Once one can see as it really is the arising, ceasing, allure, danger, and escape regarding form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, one will no longer cling to or crave the five aggregates.

XII. Contemplating the Impermanence of the Five Aggregates and the Establishment of Right View

Contemplation of impermanence is one of the direct means to establish right view. By observing form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, and seeing that they are all impermanent, one can attain right view. Form is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is impermanent, formations are impermanent, and consciousness is impermanent; there is no form, feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness that is permanent and unchanging. Therefore, whatever is impermanent must be suffering; and since the five aggregates are impermanent and suffering, they should not be regarded as “this is mine,” “this I am,” or “this is my true self.”

From such contemplation of impermanence, disenchantment arises, leading onward to liberation. When a practitioner uses correct wisdom to observe the five aggregates as impermanent, as suffering, and as phenomena of change, disenchantment with the aggregates arises; because of disenchantment, there is dispassion; because of dispassion, there is liberation. When liberation is achieved, the knowledge of liberation arises: one knows that birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, and there is no further coming to any state of being.

This observation should not be confined to only a portion of the five aggregates; it must be applied comprehensively to all five aggregates, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near. One should evenly see with right wisdom that they are impermanent, suffering, and changing phenomena, and firmly recognize, “This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my essence.” Through such contemplation, one can truly abandon clinging to the five aggregates.

XIII. The Five Aggregates as the Root of Wrong Views

Various wrong views and extreme positions largely arise from clinging to the five aggregates. When a person clings to the five aggregates and loves them, he easily falls into wrong conceptions associated with eternalism and annihilationism. For instance, because form exists and one clings to it, one may generate wrong views such as “the wind does not blow, rivers do not flow, pregnant women do not give birth, the sun and moon neither rise nor set, but stand like pillars,” or that “after death, there is a self that is neither suffering nor happiness and is free of illness.” Likewise, due to clinging to feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, one generates similar types of wrong views. The root of these errors is a lack of correct understanding that the five aggregates are impermanent and non-self and a failure to see that they are changeable, impermanent phenomena. One mistakenly takes them as “what is mine,” as “I,” or as “my essence.”

The fundamental cause of worldly dogmatic views also lies here. When one is ignorant of the five aggregates’ nature, ignorant of the causes of their arising, ignorant of their cessation, and ignorant of the path that leads to their cessation, and when there is also lack of seeing, no direct experience, no understanding, no penetration, no even-handed observation, no continuous observation, no close observation, no balanced examination, no deep examination, and no direct seeing, then in each domain of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—one fails to establish seeing in accordance with reality, and thus strays into various extreme views.

XIV. Levels of Practitioners, Inquiry into Doctrine, and the Practice of the Three Trainings

A genuine inquirer into the Dhamma can observe as they really are the arising, dependence, and ceasing of phenomena of life. Through such observation, disenchantment and dispassion arise spontaneously, leading on to non-clinging and liberation. Such a practitioner not only understands the impermanence, suffering, and non-self of the five aggregates, but also actively contemplates their arising and cessation, perceives their allure and their danger, and learns the method for escaping from the five aggregates.

In the progress of practice, knowledge of liberation also has its stages. First there is “knowing through realization,” that is, having clear experiential insight into the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates and of all phenomena of suffering. Further on there is “comprehensive knowledge,” meaning a complete and thorough understanding and penetration of these phenomena. Such realization and understanding must be grounded in solid foundations of practice, namely the five spiritual faculties: the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. By cultivating these five faculties, a practitioner can steadily advance in right view and right practice.

At the same time, the practitioner must confront the five higher fetters: craving for form existence, craving for formless existence, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. Craving for form existence is attachment to the form realm; craving for formless existence is attachment to the formless realm; conceit is an attitude of arrogance; restlessness is inner agitation and lack of serenity; ignorance is the unknowing foolishness that fails to understand the truth. These five higher fetters bind practitioners on a subtler level and must be gradually tamed and cut off with the wisdom of impermanence, suffering, and non-self.

XV. Transcending Name-and-Form and Complete Liberation

The practice of transcending name-and-form centers on ending name-and-form, severing obstructions, and abandoning attachment to appearances of form, thus completely cutting off all bonds. Where the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and air—cease, there the conditions that drive the turning of the wheel likewise cease, and name-and-form is extinguished without remainder. The round of birth and death then comes to an end. This transcending is not merely a theoretical description but the outcome of actual practice: by accurately observing the five aggregates and name-and-form, and step by step cutting off attachment and craving, it is realized and made concrete in one’s practice.

On this path leading to Nibbāna, the key principle is to use wisdom to observe that all the elements that constitute experience are not a permanent, unchanging “self.” A practitioner must apply the contemplation of non-self to every detail: to the six sense faculties, the six sense objects, the six consciousnesses, the six contacts, and all feelings that arise from them, seeing that they are non-self. Whatever is impermanent, suffering, and subject to decay should never be taken as “this is mine,” “this I am,” or “this is my self.” When a person can observe the five aggregates and all phenomena with the insight, “This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my essence,” then consciousness will no longer be blocked and fixated, and liberation naturally arises.

Conversely, if consciousness clings to any one of the aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness—it will settle on that aggregate as its object and dwell there, expanding through its attachment to that aggregate and becoming fixated and obstructed, unable to gain liberation. Thus whether or not one can refrain from dwelling in any of the five aggregates, refrain from taking them as objects of pleasure, joy, and happiness, and know as it really is the cessation of consciousness and of the five aggregates, becomes the key to eliminating related wrong views and bonds.

When a practitioner can know as it really is the nature, arising, and ceasing of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, he thereby understands the arising and ceasing of all phenomena of suffering. Through accurate observation of the dark, delusive nature of the five aggregates and all the elements that constitute experience, the mind will naturally become disenchanted with them. This disenchantment leads to dispassion, and dispassion leads to liberation. In the end, the practitioner establishes a stable right view: that all phenomena are impermanent, suffering, and decaying, and that they are not self, not what is mine, and not my self. On this basis, the flow of birth and death is completely brought to an end, and one treads the ultimate path leading to Nibbāna.
