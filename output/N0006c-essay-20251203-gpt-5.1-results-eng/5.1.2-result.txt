<title> Good Friends, Noble Ones, and Exemplars: The Complete Path from Virtue to Liberation </title>
<article>
I. Guidance of Good Friends and the Wholesome Path  
I.1 Drawing Near to Good Friends and Moving toward Good Destinations  

On the journey of life, the greatest benefit of drawing near to genuine good friends lies in their ability to guide people toward good destinations, so that they do not fall into bad paths or go astray. Such good friends do not merely exhort others with words; rather, through their own conduct and character they practically lead those around them forward along the wholesome path. Because of associating with them, others step by step move toward a place of light, purity, and security.  

II. The Qualities of Noble Ones and the Manifestation of Virtue  
II.1 The Definition and Inner Qualities of a Noble Person  

A “noble person” is one whose reputation is without blemish and whose conduct can stand up to scrutiny. Their good name does not rest on false publicity, but is established upon actions that are genuine and pure. A noble person can see hidden truths; they penetrate with the eye of wisdom those deep laws that ordinary people find hard to perceive.  

They practice generosity with wisdom—not out of a desire for fame, profit, or emotional entanglement, but from understanding the true meaning of giving, and they give with a clear and lucid mind.  

Such people are not attached to a house of sensual desire, nor do they bind their hearts long-term to craving and to clinging to family life. Instead, they understand the nature of all worldly phenomena, are thoroughly familiar with the affairs of the world, and are not ensnared by them. Precisely because of this, they can walk the noble path, progress along the correct road, and not deviate from the way to liberation. Noble ones are themselves practitioners of the holy path, and they also serve as the standards that later practitioners can follow.  

II.2 The Fulfillment of Virtue and the Respect of the World  

Those whose virtue is fulfilled are often universally respected in the world. To have virtue fulfilled means that all aspects of their moral character have been accomplished—neither one-sided nor deficient. Whether in their observance of precepts, their wisdom, or their dealings with others, they consistently display purity and integrity.  

Because such virtue is clearly visible in daily life, they naturally receive widespread respect. Whether among laypeople or monastics, they are admired by all and become models for both worldly conduct and spiritual practice.  

II.3 The Noble One’s Practice and Praise of Heedfulness  

True noble ones not only cultivate various wholesome qualities themselves, they also place great emphasis on “heedfulness” (non-negligence). In life and practice they carefully guard body, speech, and mind, not allowing themselves to follow after distraction and laziness. Instead, with a steady, focused, and lucid mind, they continuously accumulate good deeds and merits.  

Noble ones practice heedfulness themselves and also praise heedfulness in words. They commend an attitude that does not waste time, life, or opportunities for practice, and they encourage everyone to abandon laziness and cherish every moment of diligent effort.  

III. The Merits of the True Teacher and the Chief Disciples  
III.1 The Teacher’s Own Qualities and the Turning of the Wheel of Dhamma  

A true teacher is one who knows, fully understands, and is skilled in the path to liberation. They do not merely know the principles in a superficial way; rather, they possess a complete and thorough understanding of this path. They know its whole structure and its details—how to begin, how to progress, and what its key points and difficulties are.  

The teacher not only understands this path personally, but can also skillfully convey it to others so that people of differing capacities can all understand and benefit.  

Because they are deeply familiar with the right path, such a teacher can correctly set in motion the unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma. They do not deviate from truth, nor do they mislead people with erroneous teachings. The Dhamma they proclaim can reveal the truth as it really is, guiding beings toward ultimate safety and peace. By means of the unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma, they lead countless beings forward together on the way to liberation.  

III.2 The Wisdom and Mission of the Chief Disciples  

Under such a teacher there are chief disciples who shoulder the important responsibility of carrying on the lineage of the Dhamma. These chief disciples are called noble ones, and they themselves possess firm and extensive wisdom.  

They have great wisdom, enabling them to understand deep and vast Dhamma principles;  
they have broad wisdom, enabling them to be thoroughly familiar with many aspects of the teaching and its practices;  
they have quick wisdom, enabling them to swiftly realize and flexibly apply what they have learned;  
they have sharp wisdom, enabling them to pierce directly to the crucial points;  
and they have penetrating wisdom, enabling them to integrate the teachings and practical cultivation into a unified whole.  

Precisely because they possess these kinds of wisdom, the chief disciples are able to faithfully continue the Dhamma transmitted by the teacher: without distortion, without diminution, and without imposing their own personal biases upon it. They receive the teacher’s instruction as it truly is, and then pass it on clearly and correctly to later practitioners, so that the true Dhamma may long endure and bring benefit to many.  

III.3 The Exemplary Status of the Awakened Ones and the Lineage of Transmission  

Within the lineage of practice, those who are awakened are themselves the highest exemplars. Practitioners should maintain a most sincere attitude of respect toward such awakened ones, regarding them as living examples of accomplished practice.  

This respect is not mere worship; rather, with genuine hearts they acknowledge the real attainments and pure virtues of the awakened ones, and in their own minds set a direction: to follow the path they have walked, to learn the purity of their body, speech, and mind, and to take them as exemplary figures for their own spiritual accomplishment.  

IV. Those Worthy of Respect and Offerings  
IV.1 Those Who Should Be Honored and Supported in the Worldly Sphere  

On the worldly level, there are certain people who rightly deserve respect and support. First are one’s mother and father. Because parents give birth to and raise their children, their kindness is profound, and children should repay them with respect and care.  

Next is one’s elder brother. As a senior member of the family, he bears responsibility for care and guidance, and therefore should receive appropriate respect.  

In addition, teachers play an extremely crucial role in education and in guiding one’s life. Thus, in the worldly sphere, teachers too are among those worthy of respect and offerings.  

IV.2 Noble Ones Who Should Be Honored Beyond the World  

On the supramundane level, the cool and peaceful arahants are among those most worthy of respect. They have extinguished the fires of defilement; their hearts are like cool earth, no longer scorched by greed, hatred, and delusion.  

Besides them, any practitioners who have completely cut off defilements—whether lay or monastic—as long as they have truly eradicated defilements and fulfilled the goal of the path, are likewise objects of reverence and offerings in the supramundane sphere.  

Reverence toward such noble ones purifies the practitioner’s own mind and serves as a reminder not to forget the pursuit of the path to liberation.  

IV.3 The Broad Principle Governing Those Worthy of Reverence  

Viewed from a more comprehensive perspective, the scope of noble and virtuous people worthy of reverence is very broad.  

Anyone who is endowed with moral discipline and whose heart is tranquil is worthy of respect. Monastics who are upright and truthful, who do not package themselves with hypocrisy and whose conduct is proper, should also be honored. Practitioners who diligently cultivate the pure holy life, carefully guarding bodily and mental behavior and focusing single-mindedly on the path of purity, likewise deserve respect.  

Laypeople who cultivate merit—even though they have not gone forth—strive to do good and accumulate wholesome karma within the family and society. Lay followers who keep the precepts purely restrain themselves with moral discipline so that their lives do not stray from the right path. Those who care for their wives and families in accordance with the Dhamma, handling family responsibilities in a rightful way—these all fall within the range of those to be honored.  

Arahants who have brought greed, hatred, and delusion to complete exhaustion have utterly cut off all root defilements and are naturally the highest objects of reverence. Yet noble disciples still in training, who have subdued greed and hatred and gone beyond much ignorance, though still on the path of learning, have already greatly subdued defilements and should likewise be respected.  

Those who strive diligently in cultivation without negligence—whether in walking pilgrimage, meditation practice, or daily observance of precepts—as long as they continuously apply themselves and are not heedless, are all worthy of praise.  

Monastics who go from village to village for alms, free of craving in their hearts, maintaining their practice through a life of simplicity and not letting material desires dominate them; those who do not hoard possessions and are content with little; people whose speech is noble and whose actions are upright, who do not harm others with their words and whose behavior is open and aboveboard; practitioners who travel quietly and mindfully, speaking little while remaining inwardly alert; those who remain peaceful amid conflicts, not carried along by disputes and able to maintain inner stillness within opposition; those who are non-attached amidst attachment, who dwell in environments full of clinging yet are not bound by external conditions—  
all such persons meet the criteria of those who should be honored and are worthy of respect and emulation in the hearts of practitioners.  

V. The Conduct and Honors of Exemplary Practitioners  
V.1 The Inner Meaning of Exemplary Conduct  

To become an exemplary practitioner, one must first maintain a correct attitude in approaching lay life. “Entering lay life with a correct mindset” does not necessarily mean one must leave the household. Rather, even while living as a layperson, one can regard wealth, family affection, and daily affairs with a lucid mind, not being dragged about by them, but skillfully using all circumstances as conditions for cultivating virtue.  

Such a person can remain calm in all situations. Whether in favorable or unfavorable conditions, they are not easily shaken by external circumstances.  

When encountering matters of giving and receiving, they do not allow their hearts to fluctuate excessively. They do not become arrogant because of receiving offerings, nor do they feel regret or become attached to fame when practicing generosity. Their minds are steady; understanding that both giving and receiving arise from conditions, they see no need to cling. Thus, in the midst of giving and receiving, they can maintain inner stability and unshakable peace.  

V.2 Learning the Essentials of Practice and Applying Them in Daily Life  

Later students should earnestly learn from the attitude of such exemplary practitioners. They should observe how these exemplars’ minds operate when facing people and situations, and take this correct attitude as their model.  

Learning should not stop at observing and praising; one must actually put into practice the correct conduct they have taught. How to speak, how to handle relationships, how to respond to difficulties—all of this should be personally carried out in accordance with the examples they have set.  

At the same time, true learning must be concretely implemented in daily life, not just temporarily applied in special circumstances. Whether at home, in the workplace, or in a monastery, the essentials of practice should be practically applied, so that one’s behavior and thoughts gradually approach the standard of the exemplary practitioners, allowing spiritual practice to become an integral part of life itself.  

V.3 The Respect and Honors Received by Exemplary Practitioners  

When a practitioner truly becomes an exemplar, they naturally receive appropriate honors within the community of practice. Senior practitioners respect them, and they are invited to sit in fitting places among the assembly. This is not out of vanity, but is a genuine recognition of their virtue and their diligent cultivation.  

At the same time, they are praised as “fortunate ones,” for they have encountered the true Dhamma and made good use of their human life to accomplish pure conduct.  

They are also acknowledged as good learners, meaning such people are diligent in studying the teaching and do not slacken in reflection and practice. Respect from elders and recognition from fellow practitioners—these honors are the natural results of their authentic conduct, not positions and reputations they have deliberately pursued.  

V.4 Exemplary Figures among Lay and Monastic Disciples  

Within the community of practitioners, there are commonly recognized exemplars among both lay and monastic disciples.  

Among laymen, Citta the householder and Hatthaka of Āḷavī are regarded as models. Despite living as householders, they were able to steadfastly practice the true Dhamma, demonstrating the heights that lay practitioners can attain.  

Among laywomen, the lay follower Khujjuttarā and the lay follower Velukandakiya, mother of Nanda, are standard exemplars. As women and lay disciples, they displayed firm faith and strong capacity for practice, becoming guiding examples for other laywomen.  

Among monastic disciples, the exemplary bhikkhus are Sāriputta and Mahā-Moggallāna. They achieved outstanding accomplishments in wisdom and spiritual powers, and took on key roles in teaching the Dhamma and instructing junior monks, thereby becoming universally acknowledged models for male monastics.  

Among bhikkhunīs, the exemplary figures are Bhikkhunī Khemā and Bhikkhunī Uppalavaṇṇā (“Lotus-hued”). In moral discipline and in the cultivation of concentration and wisdom they both displayed consummate excellence, proving that nuns can likewise reach high standards on the path to liberation, and serving as role models for female monastics.  

VI. The Traits of Teachers of Other Paths and the Need for Caution  
VI.1 Aberrant Behavior and Self-Promotion among Teachers of Other Paths  

In contrast with true teachers and noble ones, teachers of other paths often present themselves in markedly different ways. They may, for instance, go naked or engage in other extreme forms of display, using various abnormal behaviors to attract attention. In speech they may habitually resort to falsehood, uttering untrue words that mislead others.  

Such people proclaim themselves to be guides and models for the multitude, claiming that they are qualified to instruct others and asserting that they have already attained the fruits of the contemplative life, as if they had reached lofty realization.  

Yet their behavior often gives rise to doubt and unease, provoking the astonishment of the public. Observers, seeing their conduct, feel that their words and actions do not match and even suspect their authenticity.  

This phenomenon reminds people that, when choosing teachers and those from whom to learn, one should not rely merely on external poses or self-promotion. Rather, one must observe whether their character is pure, whether their words and actions are consistent, and whether they truly embody the qualities of a genuine teacher and noble one.  

VII. The Core Aim of Liberation and Worldly Exemplars  
VII.1 The Aim of Liberation and Three Types of Worldly Exemplars  

To speak of the core aim of liberation is inevitably to address the handling of greed, hatred, and delusion. From a worldly perspective, there are three types of people who can serve as exemplars related to liberation.  

First are “speakers of Dhamma.” They can expound teachings on abandoning greed, hatred, and delusion, verbally pointing out how to distance oneself from the three poisons and helping others understand, on the level of view, the importance of and methods for abandoning them.  

Second are “doers of good.” These people do not merely speak; in their own behavior they actually practice the abandoning of greed, hatred, and delusion. Their lives and spiritual practice concretize the teaching of leaving behind the three poisons. By leading through their own example, they demonstrate the power of unity between principle and practice.  

Finally there are “those who have reached the good destination.” These are people who have completely cut off greed, hatred, and delusion so that they never arise again. For such people, the three poisons no longer lurk within consciousness; they have truly attained ultimate inner purity and peace.  

From speakers of Dhamma, to doers of good, and then to those who have fully arrived, we see a complete ladder: from the proclamation of doctrine, to embodying it in deeds, and finally to its total fulfillment. This clearly presents the stages of the path to liberation and its core aim.
