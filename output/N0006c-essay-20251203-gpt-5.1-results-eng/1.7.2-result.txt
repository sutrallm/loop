<title> Dispassion and Liberation: The Complete Path from Craving for the Five Sensual Desires to Secure Nirvāṇa </title>
<article>
I. The Fundamental Meaning of Desire and Bondage

I.1 The Core of Taming Desire and Abandoning Craving

One key point of practice is to abandon attachment to all forms of desire, cut off the craving for unwholesome desires, and uproot the very root of inner thirsting. Only by staying far from craving for the five kinds of sensual desire and the desires of thought can one be liberated from them and no longer be tightly bound by the suffering and fetters they bring. Furthermore, one must relinquish attachment to family, wealth, and relatives, so that in the world one no longer gives rise to jealousy out of various comparisons of self and others and a mind of possessiveness. To tame desire itself is equivalent to taming various calamities and afflictions; only by taming desire can one gain true liberation, and once one is far from desire, all bondage can be cut off.

In this process of renunciation, one must give up those factors of bondage that are like ropes and nets, binding and entangling body and mind. These fetters do not exist in a single form, but are woven from many conditions and attitudes, so one must have the resolve to let them go one by one.

I.2 The Nature of Bondage and the True Root of Sensual Stain

The so‑called bondage and factors of bondage, though spoken of in different ways, all point to one fact: bondage is not the direct action of some single entity or isolated object. The sense faculties and their objects themselves do not mutually bind one another. True bondage arises from sensual defilement that is conditioned by contact between the six sense bases and the six sense objects. When eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind come into contact with their corresponding forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects, if craving and clinging arise in the mind, this sensual defilement is the real root that fetters beings.

Thus, the essence of bondage does not lie in external objects, but in the love, attachment, and grasping that arise within. The cessation of suffering necessarily depends on the cessation of craving; when attachment ceases, then even when facing misfortune, the mind can remain calm and no longer give rise to distress. To thoroughly understand bondage is to see that bondage and the factors of bondage are differentiated phenomena that arise dependent on various conditions, and are not some fixed, unchanging power imposed unilaterally upon people.

I.3 The Principle of Dispassion and the Direction of Liberation

The core of practice is a path of dispassion. The principle of dispassion states that only by distancing oneself from desire and attachment can one reach liberation. This principle is not confined to some partial aspect of practice; it universally applies to avoiding unwholesome thoughts, improper actions, and laziness, and also to restraining the six sense doors and to diligent cultivation. By distancing oneself from desire one can gradually proceed toward liberation, and ultimately realize a state of dispassion and non‑clinging.

What is to be abandoned is not just a few specific desires, but all craving for phenomena that are impermanent, suffering, and not‑self. The aim in giving up craving is dispassion, liberation, and the attainment of non‑clinging final nirvāṇa. From this it is clear that right from the start one must set the direction correctly: not merely applying a little restraint to desire, but fundamentally seeing the danger in desire, cultivating the principle of dispassion, regarding craving as the basic condition for suffering, and taking the cutting off of craving as the foundation for the cessation of suffering.

II. The Five Desires and Sense Objects

II.1 The Content of the Five Desires and the Five Refined Sensual Pleasures

The so‑called five desires refer to pleasure taken in five kinds of sensory objects. Form is the visible shapes and colors seen by the eye; sound is the sounds heard by the ear; smell is the fragrance perceived by the nose; taste is the flavor tasted by the tongue; tangible is the touch experienced by the body. Further, the five refined sensual pleasures are the forms cognized by the eye, the sounds cognized by the ear, the smells cognized by the nose, the tastes cognized by the tongue, and the tangibles cognized by the body. They are pleasant, lovable, agreeable, enjoyable in appearance, arousing desire, and capable of staining the mind; they easily provoke craving and defilement.

However, regarding these five kinds of sensual pleasures of form, sound, smell, taste, and touch, a practitioner should thoroughly abandon them, because these sense objects are not what a practitioner truly needs. Since they possess the qualities of being pleasant, lovable, agreeable, easily arousing desire, and easily leading to attachment, the more one indulges in chasing them, the deeper one becomes entangled in the net of saṃsāric birth and death.

II.2 The Criterion and Universality of “Supreme Sensual Craving”

Among pleasures, the state called “supreme sensual craving” means that when a person feels satisfied with a certain kind of pleasure and no longer wishes for some more superior or subtler pleasure of the same kind, then, for that person, this pleasure is regarded as the unsurpassed, most excellent pleasure. This criterion applies universally to each kind of pleasure—form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. For different individuals, the highest kind of pleasure may differ: some favor sights, others sounds or tastes, and so on. But as long as the inner state of “being already satisfied and no longer seeking something higher” is present, then for that person it becomes the supreme sensual craving.

This principle reminds us: as long as we still regard some sensory pleasure as “the highest joy of this life,” we are prone to generate a strong craving for it, and to be unconsciously led by it. Precisely for this reason, in practice we must not only recognize the various kinds of pleasure, but also examine whether we have built up a mistaken value judgment of “unsurpassed and supreme” around some particular pleasure.

II.3 Observing Grasping, Enjoyment, and Drawbacks

Whatever forms seen by the eye, sounds heard by the ear, smells sniffed by the nose, tastes sampled by the tongue, tangibles felt by the body, and mental objects known by the mind—all belong to “phenomena liable to be grasped.” Once sensual defilement arises toward these graspable phenomena, grasping is established. Our attitude toward these objects can be observed in two ways: one is to fix on their enjoyable flavor, contemplating only their pleasant and agreeable side; the other is to start from observing their drawbacks, clearly seeing the danger and suffering they bring. If, regarding all phenomena that are taken up and grasped, one can dwell in the perspective of observing their drawbacks, then the mind’s craving will come to a stop, and once craving ceases, the grasping of these phenomena will likewise be extinguished.

In other words, when facing forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects, if one merely savors their enjoyable flavor again and again, sensual defilement will grow; if one can instead turn to observing their defects and dangers, craving has a chance to cease. This shift—from savoring pleasure to contemplating danger—is a crucial key for breaking grasping and undoing bondage.

II.4 The Critical Relationship Between Sense Objects and Mental Attitude

When the objects recognized by eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind have a nature that gladdens, delights, pleases, is lovable, and arouses desire, if the mind does not rejoice in them, does not praise them, and does not cling to them, then no mind of attachment will arise; and without attachment, bondage does not form. Hence the real key does not lie in the sense objects themselves, but in whether the mind raises grasping and attachment when facing these objects.

Therefore, liberation does not consist in completely avoiding all sensory experience, but in cutting off craving for the six kinds of objects by not clinging to sensory experiences, thereby purifying the mind’s grasping of these realms. As long as one does not generate longing, attachment, and craving for sense objects, one can step by step move toward liberation. This also shows that the main effort of practice lies in taming the mind, not in simply rejecting external objects.

II.5 The Six Sense Objects, Grasping, and Nirvāṇa

If, regarding the six kinds of sense objects—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—the mind gives rise to joy, praises them, and clings to them, then consciousness will rely on and hold to these objects and dwell in them. As long as such a state of grasping remains, one cannot attain nirvāṇa in this very life. Conversely, if regarding these six kinds of sense objects one does not give rise to joy, does not praise them, and does not dwell in attachment to them, then consciousness will not rely on or grasp them, and one who lacks this state of grasping can attain nirvāṇa in this life.

Thus, the key lies in “reliance or non‑reliance”: if consciousness relies on the six sense objects, it will be constrained by them; if it does not rely on them, liberation becomes possible. This further illustrates that the senses and external objects themselves are not bondage; the true bondage lies in grasping and sensual defilement.

II.6 The Simile of Six Baits and Not Swallowing the Hook

When facing six kinds of bait‑like objects, if one does not rejoice in them, does not praise them, and does not cling to them, it is like not swallowing a fishhook and thus not being drawn into a trap. Such an attitude is as if the hook has been broken apart, thereby avoiding disaster and ruin, and keeping oneself from becoming a captive of Māra. This simile shows that as long as one does not give rise to joy and praise toward enticing realms, and does not let the mind remain and grasp there, one can avoid falling into the net of bondage to birth and death.

III. The Concrete Path of Practicing Dispassion

III.1 Right Choices of What to Take Up and Give Up in Practice

In the direction of taking up and giving up, one should abandon the craving for future pleasures that will bring suffering, and no longer project the mind into fantasies of future sensual enjoyments. Instead, one should pursue the present, directly available path of practice that truly leads to nirvāṇa. Once the causes of suffering are clearly seen, one should no longer incline the heart toward sensual craving, but recognize that sensual craving itself is the bondage of the world, and learn how to untie this bondage.

Regarding the five kinds of sensual pleasures—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles—one must thoroughly abandon them, for these are not what a practitioner truly needs. A practitioner should give up longing and attachment for household life, stay far from all the roots of desire, and choose a place of dwelling free of craving and expectation, so as not to be constantly pulled by environment and relationships.

III.2 Solitude and Letting Go of Clinging to Time

The core of dwelling in solitude lies in giving up clinging to the three times. This includes abandoning attachment to the past, no longer repeatedly recalling and cherishing past experiences; no longer craving the future, not pinning one’s hopes on yet‑to‑come pleasures; and regarding what one presently possesses, not giving rise to desire, not developing craving for current benefits and enjoyments. When one can thus abandon desire for past, future, and present acquisitions, the mind gradually approaches genuine solitude and purity.

III.3 Empty of All Desires and the Simile of a Tree with Its Root Cut

To be “already empty of all desires” means to have completely relinquished, with respect to various desires, all craving, desire, attachment, thirst, feverish agitation, and longing. Furthermore, one must cut off craving for the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, so that such craving is like a tree whose root has been severed and will never grow again. Only when craving for the five aggregates is utterly cut off—like a tree cut down at the root, never to sprout again—can it be said that the fetter of craving has truly been severed.

In the principle of liberation of consciousness, the key to liberation lies precisely in cutting off attachment. Once attachment is severed, the link between consciousness and its objects is broken. When a bhikkhu cuts off craving for the realms of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, then because craving has ceased, the link between consciousness and these objects is cut off, and consciousness loses the possibility of taking them as its support. The very basis for the activity of consciousness is thereby severed, and it loses the object and support required for its existence. This is the concrete process of liberation of consciousness.

III.4 Disenchantment, Contemplation of Impermanence, and the Arising of Dispassion

In the sequence of arising of insight, dispassion arises due to disenchantment. By contemplating impermanence, one gradually develops a sense of revulsion toward the six sense bases, the six objects, the six kinds of consciousness, the six types of contact, and all the feelings that arise therefrom. When one deeply realizes that they are ultimately changing and mutable, beyond control, one naturally gives rise to disenchantment with them, and no longer believes that they contain anything worth craving for or relying on in the long term.

When wisdom arises, attachment to feeling disappears. Once attachment disappears, one can withdraw from feelings and attain the state of dispassion. If, for all phenomena that have been grasped, one abides for a long time in the perspective of observing their drawbacks, the mind’s craving will gradually come to rest, and bondage will be loosened. Such contemplation keeps one from being lost in present pleasant feelings and from fearing painful feelings, enabling one instead to see clearly the arising and passing away that are their true nature.

III.5 Cutting Off the Secondary Defilements and Inclining the Mind to Renunciation

If, regarding the six kinds of objects mentioned above, one can cut off the secondary defilements in the mind, the mind will naturally incline toward renunciation and will be able to fully realize renunciation. This means that it is not enough merely to avoid coarse defilements; one must also observe and cut off subtle secondary defilements. When the subtle attachments and unease concerning the six sense bases, the six sense objects, and various realms gradually die out, the mind will naturally lean toward dispassion and transcendence, instead of continuing to circle around worldly sensual pleasures.

In this process, the principle of dispassion is concretely applied at every level: avoiding the arising of unwholesome thoughts, preventing improper actions, overcoming laziness in practice, and by restraining the sense doors and sustaining diligent cultivation, gradually leading the mind away from desire and grasping. In this way, renunciation is no longer just an idea but becomes a concretely workable path.

IV. The Peace and Liberation Accomplished by Dispassion

IV.1 When Craving Ceases, Suffering No Longer Arises

When a person is free from craving, desire, attachment, thirst, feverish agitation, and longing toward form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, then as these five aggregates change and mutate, they will no longer trigger sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, or despair. Conversely, if one still clings to them, then when faced with impermanence and change, one will inevitably give rise to various negative emotions. Whether suffering appears or not depends on whether craving and attachment are still present.

The fundamental condition for the cessation of suffering is the elimination of craving. When attachment disappears, then even in the face of misfortune the mind can remain calm and free from distress. With correct understanding, one no longer responds to various changing states with negative emotion; even in the face of major changes, the mind can remain steady. This steadiness is not numbness, but arises because one has clearly seen the conditions of bondage and liberation, and is no longer dragged about by love and hate.

IV.2 The Happiness of the Liberated and the Characteristics of One Who Is Secure

One who is liberated possesses a kind of happiness that transcends worldly worries. In situations such as loss of property, failure to find what one seeks, poor harvests, empty storehouses, rough bedding, infestation by insects and lice, separation from children, parting from relatives, frustration in sexual desire, bodily contact, unpaid debts, and creditors pressing for repayment—in all these, such a person does not give rise to anxiety, agitation, sorrow, panic, weariness, anger, grief, lamentation, craving, attachment, fear, or worry. This is not because that person does not encounter such situations, but because his mind is no longer disturbed by them.

One who is secure is someone who has completely abandoned all lovable, delightful, desire‑arousing objects cognized by eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. These objects have been rooted out from his heart, like a tree whose trunk has been cut off so that it will never grow again. Because he has relinquished the attraction of these objects, he is called one who is secure, no longer being pulled by craving.

IV.3 The Solitary Dweller and the State of Not Being Stained by the Six Sense Objects

A practitioner who has escaped from bondage to delight is called a solitary dweller. Even while living in the midst of people, as long as the inner craving for sense objects has been extinguished, this person is in essence a solitary dweller. He no longer relies on external relationships, sights, sounds, or reputation to confirm his existence, but abides in an independent condition that is not driven by sensual pleasure.

In more advanced practice, to remain unstained by the six sense objects is the way to approach nirvāṇa. When encountering the six sense objects, one can maintain right mindfulness; when feelings arise, one does not face them with a mind of attachment, does not keep lingering clinging in the heart, but merely knows them as they are. The feelings experienced then are like feelings on a supramundane path, no longer accumulating into new causes of suffering. Here suffering is eliminated and no longer accumulates. When a practitioner moves about the world with right mindfulness in this way, this is a state close to nirvāṇa.

IV.4 Not Being Stained by the Six Sense Objects and Not Dwelling in the Three Times

In the basic principle of abandoning suffering and gaining happiness, first, regarding six sense objects one has never encountered before, one does not produce desire, defiled mind, or emotional attachment. Facing the six sense objects currently being experienced, one simply knows them as they are without clinging, not letting greed, hatred, or delusion obscure or drive the mind. When a person is no longer burdened by greed, hatred, and delusion, he no longer clings to what he sees, hears, feels, and knows. If he does not cling to these realms, then he does not abide in this life, does not abide in a future life, and does not abide in the interval between the two; thus he attains the state where suffering and distress are entirely extinguished.

At the same time, to completely cut off the root of suffering, one must abandon thirst for the six sense bases. Only when there is no longer craving and thirst at the six sense bases will the mind not repeatedly circle within the six paths of birth and death. This is how to completely cut off the root of suffering and is the key to freeing one’s life from bondage to future existence and the intermediate states.

IV.5 Freedom from Conceptualization and Clinging, and the Liberation of Consciousness

As a fruit of the practice of non‑clinging, because one no longer uses conceptual thinking and discrimination to tightly grasp all things in the world, one no longer raises attachment to anything at all. Since there is no attachment, naturally no infatuation arises. This “non‑conceptualizing” does not mean a lack of any discernment, but that one has gone beyond the mistaken evaluation of all things as “mine,” and therefore no longer regards them through the lens of love and hate.

In the liberation of consciousness, when a bhikkhu cuts off craving for the realms of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, then because craving has been severed, the link between consciousness and these objects is cut, and consciousness loses the possibility of taking them as its support. The basis for the activity of consciousness thus collapses, and it loses the object and support required for its existence. The key to liberation lies precisely in this cutting off of attachment; once attachment has been severed, consciousness no longer relies on the five aggregates and their objects, and naturally withdraws from the fundamental support of saṃsāra.

V. Right Understanding of Desire and the Full Cessation of Suffering

V.1 Desire as a Pit of Burning Coals and the State of Being Empty of All Desires

When one has a correct understanding of desire, one sees the true nature of desires as like a deep pit filled with burning coals, capable of causing death or great suffering. Recognizing desire in this way, one naturally no longer gives rise to craving, infatuation, and agitation for all desires. This vivid simile keeps one from mistaking desire for the source of happiness and instead reveals its danger and destructive power.

On this basis, the state of “being empty of all desires” means that with regard to desires one has already abandoned all craving, desire, attachment, thirst, feverish agitation, and longing. Such emptiness of desire is not repression, but a natural letting go that comes from fully seeing the truth of desire. When there is no craving, no attachment, and no thirst for desires, the mind no longer generates heat and agitation from pursuit and loss, and can abide in stillness.

V.2 The Comprehensive Application of the Principle of Dispassion and the Cessation of Suffering

The principle of dispassion is universally applicable for avoiding various unwholesome thoughts and improper actions, and also for preventing sloth, restraining the sense doors, and strengthening diligent practice. When applying this principle in actual life, one discovers that what truly matters is not whether external objects exist, but whether the mind raises grasping and attachment. The disappearance of suffering depends on the disappearance of craving; when attachment is eliminated, then even though life still has ups and downs and changes, the mind can remain calm and no longer be driven by distress.

When, regarding all phenomena that have been grasped, one abides for a long time in the perspective of observing their drawbacks, the mind’s craving gradually ceases and grasping is extinguished. In this way, one’s attitude toward forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects shifts from defilement to clarity, from reliance to non‑reliance, and thereby one realizes dispassion, liberation, and the non‑clinging nirvāṇa.

V.3 Mindful Practice Embracing the Six Sense Bases and Six Sense Objects

When through contemplating impermanence one gives rise to disenchantment, and can see the impermanence and mutability of the six sense bases, six sense objects, six kinds of consciousness, six types of contact, and all resulting feelings, one naturally no longer seeks lasting security within them. Regarding the six sense objects, if at the moment of contact one guards right mindfulness, and when feeling arises one does not respond with a mind of attachment or accumulate traces of love and clinging in the mind, but merely knows them as they are, then suffering will gradually be extinguished and will no longer accumulate.

In such a state, one does not give rise to desire, defiled mind, or emotional attachment toward six sense objects one has never previously encountered; toward the six sense objects currently being experienced, one simply knows them as they are and does not cling; being no longer burdened by greed, hatred, and delusion, one does not cling to what is seen, heard, felt, and known. When one no longer clings to seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing, one is no longer confined to this life, does not rely on a future life, and does not linger in the in‑between state; suffering and distress are thereby extinguished.

V.4 Sensory Experience, the Five Refined Sensual Pleasures, and Final Liberation

The five refined sensual pleasures—the forms for the eye, sounds for the ear, smells for the nose, tastes for the tongue, and tangibles for the body—are dangerous because they are pleasant, lovable, agreeable, appealing in appearance, arousing desire, and capable of staining the mind, and thus easily become objects upon which consciousness relies and which it grasps. When facing these realms, if one clings to their enjoyable flavor, one continually reinforces sensual defilement; if one turns to contemplating their drawbacks, one can gradually loosen grasping.

Ultimately, when a person no longer raises craving for all phenomena that are impermanent, suffering, and not‑self; when he no longer has attachment and thirst for the six sense bases, six sense objects, six kinds of consciousness, six types of contact, and the feelings that arise therefrom; when he can remain unstained by the six sense objects, practice right mindfulness among them, and not cling to feelings or accumulate new causes of suffering—then on this basis he can approach nirvāṇa. As the root of suffering—craving—comes to rest, it comes to an end; consciousness ceases to rely on any realm at all. Thus the entire path, from knowing desire and taming desire to abandoning desire and transcending desire, is brought to completion and culminates in liberation.
