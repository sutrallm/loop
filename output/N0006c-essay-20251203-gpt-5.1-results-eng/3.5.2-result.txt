The Gradual Path of Practice and the Four Noble Fruits: A Complete System from the Cultivation of Virtue to Final Liberation  
</title>

<article>  

I. Cultivating Virtue and Initial Attainments  

A truly accomplished practitioner must first be able to shoulder all the teachings imparted by the teacher, neither shirking nor belittling them, and be willing to take responsibility for carrying them out. As study and practice deepen, his wisdom gradually becomes penetrating: he can understand what he has learned as it really is, rather than remaining at the level of mere memorization and belief. At the same time, he can prepare well for the moment of death. He does not face death with fear, but has already readied his body, mind, and view through practice, making thorough preparation for the end of this life.  

After receiving ordination, if a person can stay away from noise and disturbance, choose a secluded life, and practice diligently and energetically, then it is possible for him, in this very life, to directly realize and abide in the unsurpassed goal. He can clearly know that his life has reached its end, clearly know that the holy life has been fulfilled, that what had to be done has been done, and that he will no longer undergo any further existence—no longer continue in future rounds of saṃsāric existence. This state of practice manifests a lucid self‑knowledge regarding the whole course and the final end of his life.  

If a practitioner can follow the teachings, live alone, far from others, dwell unheedless of sense pleasures, and in daily life be diligent and vigorous, dwelling with the mind collected on one object, then he is capable, in this very life, of directly realizing and bringing to completion the supreme holy life—that is, the fruit of arahantship. He can abide right here and now in this ultimate attainment, no longer driven by defilements. If he practices the Noble Eightfold Path properly and in accordance with the Dhamma, without deviation to either side, then before long he will inevitably accomplish the fruit of arahantship. For a bhikkhu who can continuously practice according to the Dhamma, as long as he does not backslide or grow slack, it does not take very long for him to realize the fruit of arahantship and to bring both liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom to completion.  


II. Direct Realization and the Principle of Liberation  

A noble disciple who has attained direct vision is vastly different, in terms of the suffering he has eliminated, from one who has not yet attained direct vision. Because he has personally realized reality, the amount of suffering he has eradicated far exceeds that of one who has not. Compared with someone who, at most, will still roam up and down the round of rebirth at most seven more times, the benefit brought by his attainment is not merely a hundred or a thousand times greater, but can be said to excel by hundreds of thousands of times; the difference in value and merit between the two is extremely great.  

Within the inner principle of liberation there is also an ordered, conditional sequence. When the mind is no longer moved and swayed by external objects, tranquillity (lightness and ease) arises. When such tranquillity is present, the mind is no longer dominated by the emotional waves of joy and elation. When there is no arising and subsiding of that kind of joy, the mind no longer gets caught in coming and going, grasping and flowing along with conditions. Without this coming and going, there is no further continuation of birth and death. Once birth and death have ceased, there is no longer this world, the next world, or an in‑between existence connecting the two; thus the round of rebirth is cut off completely.  

On the basis of this principle, the attainment of arahantship is clearly defined. Because the practitioner can directly know and see the arising, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape with respect to the five aggregates subject to clinging, he no longer clings to these five grasped aggregates. Thus he attains liberation, fulfills the holy life, and extinguishes all defilements.  

From another angle, when a practitioner directly knows and sees the arising, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape with respect to the five spiritual faculties, and is liberated by not clinging to them, he is called an arahant. His taints are destroyed, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done. He has laid down the heavy burden, attained his own true welfare, utterly destroyed all fetters of existence, and is liberated through right knowledge.  

In the classification of stages of realization, a stream‑enterer is one who, by directly knowing the arising, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape with respect to the five grasped aggregates, has become irreversible. An arahant is one who, by directly knowing the five grasped aggregates, is liberated by non‑clinging, with the taints destroyed and the holy life fulfilled. For a true ascetic (śramaṇa) or brāhmaṇa, “the true meaning” is precisely this: to realize for oneself, in this very life, by direct knowledge and direct realization, and to abide therein, firmly established in the attained state and recognized as such by others.  


III. Fetters of Defilement and Their Sequential Abandonment  

In the course of practice, the “fetters” of defilement are objects that must be gradually cut off. There is a stage of practice characterized by the fact that the practitioner has already eliminated the five lower fetters, but has not yet cut off the conceit “I am,” the craving for “I,” and the underlying tendencies related to “I” that accompany the five grasped aggregates. That is, his attachment, desire, and deep‑lying latent tendencies concerning self still coexist with the five grasped aggregates and await further purification. Even so, the cutting off of the five lower fetters already constitutes a very important basis for liberation.  

On the other hand, there are five so‑called “higher fetters”: craving for the form realm, craving for the formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. These five higher fetters are both specific types of defilement that bind beings and objects that must be countered and eliminated in actual practice. Only by contemplating and abandoning them can one further transcend the higher planes of existence.  

Within the four stages of liberation we can also see corresponding levels of fetters. At one level, all taints have been destroyed and one realizes liberation in this very life. At another, the five lower fetters are eliminated; one is reborn spontaneously (as an apparitional being) and attains final nibbāna there, never again returning to this world. Next is the state of “once‑returning”: three fetters have been abandoned and greed, hatred, and delusion have become attenuated; such a person will come back to this world only one more time and then reach the end of suffering. Finally, there is the state of stream‑entry: three fetters have been abandoned and one has become a stream‑enterer, who is irrevocably bound for full awakening and will never again fall into the lower realms. Thus it is evident that which fetters are eliminated and to what degree greed, hatred, and delusion are weakened directly determine the level of liberation at which a practitioner stands.  


IV. The Stages of Trainee and Non‑trainee  

In distinguishing stages of practice, “trainee” (one in training) is a key technical term. The characteristic of the trainee stage is that the person has already established right view and right concentration of the nature of a learner: he can correctly understand and abide in the Noble Path he practices, and is therefore called a “trainee.” He knows suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering as they really are, and at the same time is convinced that no other ascetic or brāhmaṇa’s teaching can stand on a par with the Buddha’s true Dhamma. Such a practitioner also understands the five spiritual faculties, but has not yet personally touched and realized the ultimate goal and fruits to which these faculties lead; he can only penetrate them through wise contemplation. Therefore he still belongs to the category of “trainee.”  

The difference between trainee and non‑trainee can also be seen through the practice of the four establishments of mindfulness. A trainee is one who, by practicing one portion of the four establishments of mindfulness, has already gained some attainment on the path; a non‑trainee (arahant) is one who, by practicing the four establishments of mindfulness in full, has reached complete consummation and has nothing further to learn.  

When a practitioner fully cultivates the four establishments of mindfulness, one concrete result is that the five lower fetters are completely eliminated, and he can, for himself, make the declaration of “the fruit of non‑returning,” affirming that he will not return to this world in the future.  

By practicing the four establishments of mindfulness, the practitioner can cross from this shore to the far shore, and on the path of liberation step across the boundary of birth and death. He may attain the fruit of non‑returning, or awaken in this very life, directly realize the deathless, and rightly attain the noble path that leads toward the end of suffering. That is, through such contemplation and practice, he has entered a path that truly leads to the cessation of suffering.  


V. The Five Spiritual Faculties and the System of Liberation‑Fruits  

Within the system of practice and realization, the five spiritual faculties occupy a central position. If a bhikkhu can directly know the arising and cessation of the five faculties, and discern their gratification, danger, and the way of escape, and in the end does not cling to these five faculties but attains liberation with respect to them, he is called an arahant. His taints are destroyed; the holy life has been completed; what needed to be done has been done. He has laid down the burden; his own true welfare has been achieved; all fetters of existence have been cut off; he has reached liberation through right knowledge.  

Looking at whether the five faculties are fully mature, the fruits can be graded in levels. When the five faculties are completely fulfilled, this is the state of arahantship. When the five faculties are weaker, then in order they correspond to: non‑returner, once‑returner, stream‑enterer, follower of the Dhamma, and follower by faith.  

Furthermore, there is a more fine‑grained graded classification of advanced attainments. When the five faculties are completely fulfilled it is again arahantship; when they are slightly weaker, then in sequence come: one who attains nibbāna in the intermediate realm (intermediate‑nibbāna attainer), one who attains nibbāna after deterioration, one who attains nibbāna without exertion, one who attains nibbāna with exertion, one who progresses upstream to the highest form realm, once‑returner, stream‑enterer, follower of the Dhamma, follower by faith.  

There is also a corresponding order on the path‑to‑fruit side. When the five faculties are fully mature, again this is an arahant. When they are slightly weaker, then, starting from one who is realizing the path to arahantship in the present, the sequence is: non‑returner, one who is realizing the path to the fruit of non‑returning in the present, once‑returner, one who is realizing the path to the fruit of once‑returning in the present, stream‑enterer, and one who is realizing the path to the fruit of stream‑entry in the present. If a person entirely lacks these five faculties, he is regarded as a follower of outside paths, still an ordinary worldling, not yet having entered the noble path.  

If a noble disciple can directly know and see the five spiritual faculties, he is called a stream‑enterer, one who is irrevocably bound for full awakening. If a bhikkhu can directly know and see the five faculties, and in the end does not cling to them and thereby attains liberation, he is called an arahant, having reached the ultimate state of the destruction of the taints and liberation. If some ascetic or brāhmaṇa cannot directly know and see the five faculties, he will not be acknowledged as a true ascetic or brāhmaṇa, and cannot in this very life directly realize the true meaning of “ascetic” or “brāhmaṇa.” Conversely, if he can directly know and see the five faculties, he will be acknowledged as a true ascetic or brāhmaṇa, able in this very life to realize for himself, to directly know and abide fully in that realization.  

The benefits brought by “direct knowledge” also have multiple levels of description. Through direct knowledge, a practitioner may attain unsurpassed perfect awakening; or he may know for himself that his mind is immovably liberated, be certain that this is his last life, and that he will no longer undergo further existence; or he may become a stream‑enterer, one who never again falls, irrevocably bound for full awakening; or he may become an arahant, achieving the destruction of the taints and liberation. At the same time, he can be acknowledged as a true ascetic or brāhmaṇa, one who in this very life realizes for himself, directly knows, and abides fully in that realization, bringing his present life of practice to fulfillment.  

Based on the five spiritual faculties there is yet another thirteen‑level system of liberation‑stages, arranged from high to low, which is summarized as: arahant, one who attains nibbāna in the intermediate realm, one who attains nibbāna after deterioration, one who attains nibbāna without exertion, one who attains nibbāna with exertion, one who progresses upstream to the highest form realm, once‑returner, “one‑seeded” (reborn once more in the human realm), “family‑to‑family” (wandering among good families), “seven‑times‑at‑most” (seven‑times‑at‑most returner), follower of the Dhamma, and follower by faith. These stages also reflect the varying degrees of maturity of the five faculties and the higher or lower level of attainment in practice.  

If a person fully cultivates and develops four fundamental qualities, he can become a noble one whose defilements have been completely destroyed. He can directly know and declare for himself: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, there is no more of this coming to any state of existence.”  


VI. The Four Establishments of Mindfulness, the Five Faculties, and the Fruits of Liberation  

With regard to the benefits of cultivating the five spiritual faculties, there are two main fruits that can be expected. One is realizing liberation in this very life. The other is becoming a noble one who will no longer return to the sensual realm—no longer revolving in rebirth within the sensual sphere. In addition, there are seven more detailed kinds of meritorious results, which form a complete graded sequence.  

These seven meritorious results unfold as follows: a practitioner may realize in this very life; if he does not realize in this very life, he may realize at the moment of death; if neither of these is achieved, then, since the five lower fetters have been eliminated, he attains nibbāna in the intermediate realm; if he does not attain nibbāna in the intermediate realm, then again on the basis of the elimination of the five lower fetters, he attains nibbāna after deterioration; if he does not attain nibbāna after deterioration, then, since the five lower fetters have been eliminated, he attains nibbāna without exertion; if he does not attain nibbāna without exertion, still based on the elimination of the five lower fetters, he attains nibbāna with exertion; if he does not attain even nibbāna with exertion, then, on the basis of the elimination of the five lower fetters, he is reborn upstream in the supreme form realm, and there attains nibbāna. All these possible attainments and merits together constitute the full range of fruits that a cultivator of the five faculties can reasonably look forward to.  

Through the cultivation of the four establishments of mindfulness and the maturation of the five faculties, the practitioner crosses from this shore to the far shore, attains the fruit of non‑returning or awakens in this very life, directly realizes the deathless, and rightly attains the noble path that leads toward the end of suffering, thereby displaying in his life a clearly discernible path that leads to the cessation of suffering.  


VII. The Four Noble Fruits and Intermediate Nibbāna‑Stages  

Within the system of the four noble fruits, liberation is clearly differentiated into levels. One who is liberated by final nibbāna in this very life has developed sharp and swift wisdom; since all taints are destroyed, he realizes for himself in this life, directly knows, and abides fully in liberation, reaching ultimate freedom in this very existence. A non‑returner, likewise endowed with sharp and swift wisdom, has destroyed the five lower fetters and is reborn spontaneously; he attains nibbāna there and does not return to this world.  

A once‑returner has not yet developed sharp and swift wisdom, but has eliminated the three fetters; greed, hatred, and delusion are weakened, and with only one more return to this world he will bring all suffering to an end. A stream‑enterer has also not yet attained sharp and swift wisdom, but the three fetters are completely cut off; he has gained the fruit of stream‑entry, his tendency to fall into bad destinies has been destroyed, and his progress toward liberation is now certain, bound for perfect awakening.  

The four kinds of liberation can also be explained from another angle: (1) one whose taints are destroyed and who realizes liberation in this life—this corresponds to the fruit of arahantship; (2) one who has eliminated the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, and attains nibbāna there, never again returning to this world—this corresponds to the fruit of non‑returning; (3) one who has eliminated the three fetters and whose greed, hatred, and delusion are weakened, who will come back to this world only once more and then arrive at the end of suffering—this corresponds to the fruit of once‑returning; (4) one who has eliminated the three fetters and has become a stream‑enterer, who is irrevocably bound for right awakening and will never again fall into bad realms—this corresponds to the fruit of stream‑entry. These explanations are repeatedly given in various places, mutually reinforcing each other and outlining the distinct levels of liberation of the four noble fruits.  

Further clarifying the levels of cutting off fetters and liberation: the fruit of arahantship is defined as the destruction of all taints, the attainment of taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, realized and abided in within this very life. The fruit of non‑returning is defined as the elimination of the five lower fetters; one is then reborn spontaneously and attains nibbāna in a heavenly realm, not returning to this world. The fruit of once‑returning is defined as the cutting off of the three fetters, with greed, hatred, and delusion weakened; after one more round trip between the heavenly realm and the human world, suffering comes to an end. The fruit of stream‑entry is defined as the cutting off of the three fetters, becoming a stream‑enterer who does not fall into bad destinies and is irrevocably bound for right awakening.  

There are corresponding differences in the results for lay followers (upāsakas) at death. If at the time of death they have destroyed the five lower fetters, they can be reborn spontaneously and attain nibbāna there, never returning to this world. If at the time of death they have destroyed only the three fetters and weakened greed, hatred, and delusion, they become once‑returners, needing just one more return to this world to bring suffering to an end.  

Within the gradation of the path of liberation and its fruits, there are also distinctions between “middle‑level” and “initial‑level” liberation‑fruits. A middle‑level liberator has unwavering faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and has developed sharp and swift wisdom; with the five lower fetters destroyed, he attains the various intermediate kinds of nibbāna. An initial‑level liberator likewise has unwavering faith in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha, but has not yet developed sharp and swift wisdom; only the three fetters are cut off and greed, hatred, and delusion are weakened, and therefore he gains the fruit of once‑returning.  

In the broader system of practice and liberation, above the four noble fruits there are several intermediate nibbāna‑stages. These include: one who attains nibbāna in the intermediate realm, one who attains nibbāna after deterioration, one who attains nibbāna without exertion, and one who attains nibbāna with exertion. Together with those who progress upstream to the supreme form realm, once‑returners, “one‑seeded” beings, “family‑to‑family” wanderers, “seven‑times‑at‑most” returners, followers of the Dhamma, and followers by faith, they form a thirteen‑level system of liberation‑stages beginning from the arahant and descending in order. These stages correspond one‑to‑one with the advanced stages of realization classified according to the strength of the five spiritual faculties and the seven kinds of meritorious fruits described earlier.  


VIII. Assurance of Practice‑Results and Distribution of Practitioners  

On the path of practice, if one consistently follows and fulfills the Noble Eightfold Path according to the Dhamma, and applies it over a long period without negligence, the attainment is assured. If a bhikkhu can continue to practice according to the Dhamma, it does not require a long time for him to realize the fruit of arahantship.  

From the perspective of “trainee,” a trainee practitioner has already directly known suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, and is firmly convinced that no doctrine of any other ascetic or brāhmaṇa can compare with the Buddha’s true Dhamma. However, although he understands the five spiritual faculties with the wisdom of reflection, he has not yet personally touched their ultimate goal and fruits, and therefore still remains in the stage of training.  

As the five higher fetters—craving for form, craving for the formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance—are gradually contemplated and countered, the practitioner can move from being a trainee to a non‑trainee, progressing toward complete liberation.  

Looking at the overall distribution of people, those who realize final liberation in this very life are extremely rare. Those who cut off the five lower fetters and attain the fruit of non‑returning are relatively more numerous. Those who cut off the three fetters and have greed, hatred, and delusion attenuated, needing only one more return to this world to end saṃsāra, are more numerous still. And those who cut off the three fetters and attain the fruit of stream‑entry, irrevocably bound for right awakening, form the largest group.  

This distribution shows the rough proportions of the four noble fruits and the intermediate stages among actual practitioners. It also indicates that although final liberation is hard to obtain, as long as one follows the teachings, progressing step by step in cutting off fetters, cultivating the five spiritual faculties, and practicing the four establishments of mindfulness, the fruits and liberation can indeed be expected and realized.
