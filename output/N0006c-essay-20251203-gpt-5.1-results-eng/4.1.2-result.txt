I. The Impact of Wealth on the Mind and the Consequences of Sense Pleasures  

I.1 The Change in Most People’s Mentality in the Face of Wealth  
When people obtain great wealth, in most cases their hearts begin to indulge in and become immersed in various sense pleasures. This indulgence not only keeps them lingering in sensory enjoyment, but also, without their noticing, drives them to commit various wrongdoings. Because the many enjoyments that wealth brings are intoxicating, once most people possess vast riches, they are drawn along by this intoxication and find it hard to maintain a clear mind. Thus they deepen their attachment to sense pleasures again and again, and their behavior becomes distorted, leading them to commit all kinds of mistakes. This situation accounts for the overwhelming majority among people; it is a widespread and common pattern of reaction.

I.2 The Very Few Who Can Transcend the Temptation of Wealth  
In contrast, there are also a very small number of people who, after acquiring great wealth, are still able not to indulge in or sink into sense pleasures. Though they likewise live in wealthy circumstances, they are not dragged along by wealth and enjoyment. Their minds are not captured by desire, and therefore they do not commit wrongs because of their wealth. Such people can maintain clarity and restraint amid abundance; they are neither deluded by riches nor lost due to favorable external conditions. However, this situation is extremely rare among people and is seldom seen compared with the common case of falling into indulgence through wealth.

I.3 The Distortion of Mind and Behavior When Indulging in Sense Pleasures  
When, because of wealth, a person becomes intoxicated with sense pleasures, a clear transformation occurs in the mind. Wealth makes one feel a strong intoxication toward various pleasures; the craving for enjoyment grows ever stronger. The power of greed robs one of the mindfulness that might previously have been present, and the strength of inner clarity and alertness gradually weakens. Such a person often cannot perceive that they have already deviated from the right path and even lack self-awareness of their own state, as if bound by an invisible trap. Their actions and choices all unfold under this bondage. Outwardly it appears that they are actively chasing enjoyment, but inwardly they have already lost their freedom and can only continue to create faults and mistakes under the pull of desire.

I.4 The Future Results Brought About by Indulgence in Sense Pleasures  
Because they commit various wrongdoings while intoxicated with wealth and sense pleasures, such actions will bring painful results in the future. The choice to sink into sense pleasures and allow greed to rob one of mindfulness will attract bad results, making one’s future circumstances full of suffering and unease. In other words, present heedlessness and indulgence will ultimately turn into future pain and downfall. This is the inescapable result of indulging in sense pleasures.

II. The Gap Between Outer Appearance, Worldly Success, and Genuine Purity  

II.1 Misjudgments Easily Caused by Outer Appearance and Adornment  
A person’s outer looks and all external displays very easily lead to misjudgment, so one should not simply trust and approve of others based on appearance alone. Many people in the world lack self-restraint and have impure minds, yet they do their utmost to decorate their exterior to gloss over themselves. Their clothing is splendid, their bearing impressive; on the surface they appear dignified and admirable, but inwardly they are full of impurity and various faults.  

This is like a copper vessel plated with gold: under the light the exterior shines brightly and looks precious, but inside it is only low-value copper; the inner nature does not match the brilliant surface. Many people whose inner being is impure rely precisely on such a pleasing outer appearance to move about in the world, causing others to mistakenly believe that they truly possess virtue and substance, when in fact they merely use their appearance to cover up their real condition.

II.2 The True Nature of Worldly Prominence and Palace-like Splendor  
Worldly achievements, from the standpoint of appearance, are like the many ornaments that adorn a palace. Such accomplishments resemble a highly magnificent palace decorated with garudas, white birds, tiger-shaped carvings, and many other splendid adornments, forming an extremely glorious display that inspires praise and yearning in those who see it.  

However, viewed in terms of their essence, these prominent worldly achievements are often the very source of contention and turmoil. They not only fail to bring true stability, but easily provoke rivalry, jealousy, and conflict, plunging people’s minds into unrest. The wise can see through the real nature behind such colorful and splendid scenes, and therefore they should not delight in or cling to these outer appearances, nor become lost because of their apparent glory.

II.3 The Gap Between External Rituals and Genuine Merit  
Some people focus only on external rituals—for example, relying solely on the recitation of mantras and then regarding themselves as completely pure. In reality, such external actions alone cannot truly bring about purity. If the mind is filled with filth and impurity, then even if one constantly recites mantras, the interior is still covered over by afflictions and unwholesome mental states.  

Such people often also try to hide behind their outward show and even deceive others, making people mistakenly believe that they are virtuous. Yet mere external disguise cannot turn them into genuine saints. The standard of true merit does not lie in empty mantras and forms, but in whether the mind has truly become pure and undefiled.

III. The Correct Attitude When Going to Households and Facing Offerings  

III.1 The Distress Caused by Entering Households with Wrong Expectations  
When a person is about to go into households to visit people or interact with them, it is inappropriate if the mind harbors all kinds of specific expectations. If, beforehand, one holds expectations such as “I must receive offerings,” “I should receive many offerings,” “I should receive fine offerings,” “I should receive offerings delivered quickly,” or “I should be offered with a respectful attitude,” then as soon as reality fails to match these expectations, afflictions easily arise.  

For example, if no offering is received, or only a very small offering, or the things offered are of poorer quality, or they are delivered slowly, or the attitude of the donor lacks respect, then inner annoyance and dissatisfaction arise. With the arising of anger, inner suffering and sorrow are also felt; emotions are pulled along by external conditions, giving rise to pain and affliction. In this way, one’s entire mental state completely follows external gain and loss and other people’s behavior, and the mind can hardly remain at peace. Therefore, this attitude of entering households with strong expectations as the basis is inappropriate.

III.2 Clarity and Non-clinging as the Proper Attitude in Going to Households  
By contrast, an appropriate attitude when going to households is this: before setting out, one does reflect properly on the meaning and benefits of giving, understanding that giving is beneficial for both practitioner and donor, yet after such reflection one does not cling to any specific outcome. Even if one has reflected on the many benefits that offerings may bring, one does not treat them as conditions that must be fulfilled.  

When encountering unfavorable situations—such as receiving no offering or receiving offerings different from what one had imagined—one does not let anger and resentment arise, but keeps the mind steady and unmoved by external conditions. In this way, even when outward circumstances change in many ways, the mind does not thereby experience suffering and sorrow, and one can maintain inner calm and clarity amid all kinds of situations. This attitude of not generating afflictions in adverse conditions and not treating results as necessary requirements is the correct mentality to have when going to households.

III.3 Concrete Practice of Treating All Offerings Equally  
Once one has the correct attitude, one can display an even and stable approach toward offerings. Regardless of whether the offerings received are many or few, no discrimination arises in the mind; the amount is not used as the standard for how joyful one feels. Whether the offerings are especially fine or relatively coarse, one does not choose among them inwardly, nor does one change one’s attitude toward people based on the quality of the offerings.  

As for the timing of the offerings, whether they arrive quickly or only after a delay, one does not become anxious or restless. Regarding the donor’s demeanor, whether respectful or somewhat indifferent, one likewise does not keep score and does not let the level of the other’s respect generate discrimination in one’s own mind. In this way—whether receiving much or little, fine or coarse, quickly or slowly, respectfully or casually—one responds with an equal mind in all cases, no longer allowing the mind to be driven by external conditions. This is the concrete expression of truly applying the correct attitude toward visiting households in daily conduct.

IV. How the Teaching Climate Affects the Success or Failure of the Holy Life  

IV.1 The Vicious Cycle Brought About by Wrong Role Models  
Within a community of practice, if the elders themselves fail to embody the qualities that spiritual cultivation requires and instead focus on fame and material requisites, this will bring far-reaching and harmful consequences. When elders make the pursuit of reputation and accumulation of material goods their priority, younger practitioners, seeing such an example, will often imitate it and assume that this is the very “standard of success” in practice. They then also begin to pursue fame and material wealth.  

In this way, spiritual practice gradually departs from its essence. Instead of taking inner purity and completeness of virtue as the goal, the community proceeds along the track of fame and material desire. Although such a trend may appear impressive in the short term, in the long run it actually leads to harm and suffering. The fundamental spirit of the holy life is gradually lost, until in the end it becomes difficult to sustain genuine fruits of practice.

V. The Nature, Dangers, and Proper Antidotes for Gain, Offerings, and Fame  

V.1 The Fearsome Nature of Gain, Offerings, and Fame  
Gain, offerings, and fame themselves possess an extremely fearsome, intense, and violent nature. They are not mild, neutral things, but forces with strong impact. From the perspective of spiritual practice, they are direct obstacles to reaching the supreme state of peace and are stumbling blocks on the path to the supreme peaceful nirvāṇa.  

Even if a practitioner has already attained a certain level of realization, as long as they have not achieved the unshakeable liberation of mind, their thoughts can still be obstructed, stirred, and corroded by these things. Gain, offerings, and fame can ruin people and can dazzle and confuse their minds, making a heart that might have stayed on the right path become agitated and unsteady, deviating from its original direction of purity.

V.2 Their Concrete Harm to the Mind and the Life of Practice  
In actual effect, gain, offerings, and fame cause the practitioner’s mind to become dazzled and bound. Once the mind is pulled along by these conditions, it is easy to fall into misfortune and disaster. They make practitioners no longer enjoy dwelling in secluded places, no longer willing to stay at the foot of a tree or in the open air and other quiet spots that originally were most suitable for practice and contemplation; instead, such places become something to shy away from.  

When the mind is disturbed by gain, offerings, and fame, practitioners may experience distress in all their activities—walking, standing, sitting, and lying down—almost constantly surrounded by vexation and unease. Furthermore, these things can directly undermine practice, leading one eventually to abandon learning the path and give rise to a mind of turning back from cultivation, so that the fruits of practice painstakingly built up earlier are thereby lost.  

Moreover, if one’s mind is finally ruined by gain, offerings, and fame, then after death one will be reborn in states of suffering—bad destinies, joyless realms—and even fall into hell, bearing extremely grave consequences.  

In addition, gain, offerings, and fame can cause people to lose right-mindedness and even tell lies for their sake. When a person is dazzled and attracted by these things, they will often, in order to protect already-acquired benefits and reputation, not hesitate to distort facts and violate honesty, letting a mind that should have remained upright become crooked.  

At a deeper level, these things inflict fundamental damage on practitioners. They can thoroughly dazzle the practitioner’s mind and even cause the destruction of the Saṅgha, bringing division and disputes into a community that ought to be harmonious and pure. They also lead to the cutting off of practitioners’ wholesome roots, wholesome qualities, and white (purified) states. As soon as one generates attachment to gain, offerings, and fame, one is in fact bringing about one’s own ruin and decay. Even if a person obtains a great deal of gain and offerings and outwardly seems very richly endowed, in essence these things exist only to bring about a practitioner’s downfall and cannot truly produce growth in wholesome qualities.

V.3 Their Deep Corrosion of the Saṅgha and Wholesome Qualities  
The corrosion inflicted by gain, offerings, and fame upon practitioners does not manifest all at once, but proceeds gradually, like slowly cutting away the tissues of the body, step by step, from shallow to deep. This process of erosion is likened to cutting first into the skin, then deeper into the membrane, next into flesh and sinews, and finally into the bones, penetrating all the way to the marrow.  

This metaphor shows that their harm to practitioners proceeds from the outside inward, layer by layer, until even the most central wholesome roots and pure heart are shaken and eroded. Even practitioners who have reached a certain level of attainment, as long as they have not arrived at the unshakeable liberation of mind, may gradually lose their existing merits in the course of this erosion. When gain, offerings, and fame bring about the destruction of the Saṅgha and the cutting off of wholesome roots and wholesome qualities, the very lifeblood of practice is gravely damaged. For both individuals and communities, this is a profound and serious harm.

V.4 The Proper Attitude and Antidotes When Facing Gain, Offerings, and Fame  
When facing gain, offerings, and fame, practitioners must learn to maintain a high degree of alertness, clearly knowing their dangers and actively guarding their own minds, so as not to be dazzled by them. Regarding gain, offerings, and fame that have already arisen, one should adopt an attitude of relinquishment, not leaving behind any attachment or dependence in the heart, lest they become the root of obstacles to practice. Regarding gain, offerings, and fame that have not yet arisen, one should not generate craving and expectation in advance, still less allow the mind to dwell in fascination with them.  

In the course of learning and practice, one should be earnest and sincere, ensuring that one is not obstructed by gain, offerings, and fame when they occur. That is, even if outer conditions cause one’s reputation gradually to grow and offerings to increase, one should remain alert, immediately examine oneself, and relinquish attachment to these conditions. For name, profit, and offerings that have not appeared, do not build fantasies and clinging to them in the mind. By maintaining an attitude of clarity and non-attachment, one will not already be bound by inner delusions before such things even occur.  

Furthermore, if one’s mind has already become dazzled by gain, offerings, and fame, then one should all the more avoid letting it become dazzled by other things. For example, if the mind has already been disturbed by fame and profit, one should not then develop further infatuation and fascination with other objects—such as women or physical beauty—lest the obstacles one suffers become even deeper. This warning is meant to make one understand that once the mind has begun to waver, one must guard it all the more carefully and not add new objects of delusion on top of the existing ones; otherwise, through layer upon layer of entanglement, one will sink ever deeper and find it hard to extricate oneself.

VI. Entertainment Performances and the Growth of Sentient Beings’ Afflictions  

VI.1 Behaviors and Audiences in Public Entertainment Venues  
In certain public entertainment venues, people offer performances in various forms, and those they face are most often beings who have not left behind greed, hatred, and delusion. These audience members still have their hearts covered by desire, anger, and ignorance; they have not yet fundamentally departed from these afflictions and thus are easily influenced by external stimulation. Performers in such venues may stage their shows in either realistic or fictitious ways. Whether the content presented is actual events or deliberately fabricated stories, it will produce corresponding psychological effects on the audience.

VI.2 How Performances Increase Greed, Hatred, and Delusion  
Such entertainment performances, for those inclined toward greed, will make the greed in their hearts grow ever stronger. Seeing content that caters to desire, their inner craving not only fails to cease but becomes more intense. For those inclined toward anger, these performances may also evoke or strengthen their hatred, amplifying a tendency already inclined toward wrath and opposition. As for those inclined toward ignorance, this kind of entertainment—whether presented in a realistic or fabricated manner—deepens their ignorance, increasing their lack of clarity about principles and their failure to recognize the truth.  

On the whole, such performances do not lessen sentient beings’ greed, hatred, and delusion, but instead, without people realizing it, become conditions that help the three poisons to grow.

VII. Firm Practice and Not Returning to Lay Life for the Sake of Gain  

VII.1 Strengthening an Unshakable Resolve Through the Four Foundations of Mindfulness  
When a practitioner has long cultivated the four foundations of mindfulness and the mind gradually abides in the accurate contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, a firm and hard-to-shake resolve is developed. Even if kings, ministers, or relatives and friends attempt to entice them with various riches—persuading them to give up learning the path, abandon the monastic life, and return to lay life—such a practitioner, having repeatedly trained in the four foundations of mindfulness, already has a stable mind and will not be swayed by the lure of wealth.  

For such a person, no matter how great the external power or how abundant the material wealth, it is not enough to make them abandon practice and go back to worldly life. This steadfast refusal to give up learning and to return to lay life stems precisely from the stabilizing power brought by the four foundations of mindfulness, enabling practitioners to hold fast to their original intention and continue along the path of practice without turning back, even in the face of all kinds of temptations.
