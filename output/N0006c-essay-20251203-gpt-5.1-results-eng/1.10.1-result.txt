<title> The Cessation of Suffering and Liberation: The Complete Path from Disenchantment to Nirvana </title>
<article>
I. The Suffering of Life and the Truth of Aging and Death  

I.1 Life Inevitably Leads to Decline and an Ending  
All living beings unavoidably move toward aging and death. “Aging” refers to the aging, bodily weakness, decay, white hair, wrinkled skin, shortening of lifespan, and the decline of the faculties of all kinds of beings. “Death” refers to the death of beings, their disappearance, disintegration, the end of life, the breakup of the aggregates, and the casting away of the corpse. Taken together, aging and death are called “aging-and-death”; where there is life there is death, so life itself is an expression of suffering and distress. Life not only manifests this whole process of aging and dying, it is also constantly accompanied by various elements of darkness—sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair—together forming the entire set of dark contents of life: birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

I.2 Life Surrounded by Bondage and Misfortune  
Within this structure of life, beings do not merely undergo birth, aging, and death in a simple way; rather, their whole life is subject to all kinds of bondage and injury, thereby inviting countless further misfortunes. In the natural flow of life, bondage and calamity follow like a shadow, making life itself a field where suffering and distress constantly appear. Precisely for this reason the Buddha’s teaching was proclaimed, to serve as a path guiding beings to transcend life, abandon all suffering, and enter the realm of reality.

II. The Boundary of the World and the Cessation of Distress  

II.1 The Identity of the World’s Boundary and the Cessation of Suffering  
The cessation of distress is, in fact, identical with having reached the boundary of the world. This boundary of the world does not refer to a literal outer edge in space. Therefore one need not travel to the outermost limit of the universe, nor search for any physically defined border, in order to be liberated from distress. The arising of the world and its results, the cessation of the world and the path leading to that cessation, can all be directly understood within this very body-and-mind. Thus, one must reach “the end of the world” in order to truly end suffering, but this “end” is not a matter of outwardly seeking the edge of the universe; it is a matter of seeing the cessation of distress within the mind and within bodily and mental phenomena.

II.2 A World Beyond the Cognition of the Six Sense Bases  
The essence of the world cannot be known merely by searching for an external boundary. The six sense bases and six sense objects—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, together with all the corresponding objects—constitute the world as we know it. If one only remains within the range of cognition of the six sense bases, one can only revolve within the world and cannot reach the end of the world. Therefore, to end suffering one must transcend the world constituted by cognition through the six sense bases, and depart from this world constructed by the senses. When distress ceases, it means that within this very body-and-mind one has reached “the boundary of the world,” which is the true end of the world.

III. Craving, the Five Aggregates, and the Core Principle of Cessation  

III.1 The Meaning of the Cutting Off of Craving and the Cessation of Suffering  
The cessation of suffering is, in substance, the result of the complete cutting off of craving. When craving for all forms of existence is entirely abandoned, extinguished, relinquished, cut off, and liberated, one attains a state or realm where nothing is clung to. This is what the noble truth of the cessation of suffering calls “the stopping of suffering”: to completely and thoroughly extinguish this craving, taking relinquishment, cutting off, and release as the way, and finally arriving at a state where there is no longer any grasping at all. The accomplishment of liberation depends on the complete extinction of craving; only then can it truly be said that all aggregates of suffering have been brought to rest.

III.2 The Arising and Ceasing of the Five Aggregates and the Nature of the Truth of Cessation  
The arising of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness—in itself brings suffering, illness, and aging-and-death; the cessation of the five aggregates brings the cessation of suffering, the ending of illness, and the disappearance of aging-and-death. Therefore, “because the five aggregates cease, it is called ‘cessation’”: the substance of the truth of cessation is the calming and stopping of the five aggregates. When the five aggregates arise and are welcomed and clung to with delight, this amounts to delighting in suffering, because to delight in the five aggregates is to delight in suffering. If one can cease delighting in the five aggregates, that is equivalent to no longer delighting in suffering, and since one no longer finds joy in suffering, one naturally moves toward liberation. When the suffering accumulated by the five aggregates ceases due to the cessation of clinging, the process of existence likewise ceases along with the cutting off of clinging; this is the complete extinction of the entire mass of accumulated suffering.

III.3 Non-abidance in Quietude and the Extinction of Joy and Other States  
According to the principle of “not abiding in stillness,” the extinction of joy, thought, consciousness, and feeling is not only the basis of liberation, but also its process and state. This extinction does not mean wiping out all vital activity; it means that the clinging to and dependence on joy, thought, consciousness, and feeling come completely to rest. Therefore, in the practice of the truth of cessation, what is emphasized is the ending of greed and clinging: in all the five aggregates and all mental activities, no longer establishing a “self” and “what belongs to self,” nor regarding them as lovable objects to be desired and clung to.

IV. The Sequential Process of Disenchantment, Dispassion, and Liberation  

IV.1 From Seeing Things as They Are to the Arising of Aversion  
When a noble disciple observes as they truly are the impermanent and suffering nature of the five aggregates and all bodily and mental phenomena, they give rise to a mind of disgust and aversion toward these phenomena. This observation includes clearly seeing the arising and passing away and the unreliability of all mental and sensory experiences such as contact, feeling, perception, and consciousness; and it includes a deep disenchantment with all phenomena of action and fabrication. Because of such truthful contemplation, the noble disciple feels aversion toward the five aggregates, and thus develops a mind of disenchantment toward all the above categories of bodily and mental phenomena. This disenchantment is not a passive rejection, but a lucid recognition of their impermanent, suffering, and non-self nature. It is the arising of sufficient disgust and sufficient disenchantment toward all conditioned phenomena, together with a certain sense of sufficiency within them, so that one no longer wishes to go on grasping them.

IV.2 Disenchantment Leading to Dispassion, Dispassion Leading to Liberation  
Because one gives rise to disgust toward contact, feeling, perception, consciousness, the six sense bases and their objects, and all phenomena of action, the practitioner, through this aversion, distances themselves from craving; through distancing from craving, they attain liberation. This is a clear sequence: through dislike comes dispassion; through dispassion comes liberation. When the mind of disenchantment arises, delight in phenomena gradually fades; after delight fades, sensual desire for phenomena likewise ceases. When both delight and sensual desire are gone, this state is called “release of mind through what is wholesome.” In such a liberated state, the knowledge “I am liberated” arises, clearly knowing: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further becoming.” This at the same time means that the cycle of rebirth has come to an end, the pure holy life has been completed, all that should be accomplished has been fulfilled, there is no longer bondage to birth and death, and there is no further round of rebirth.

IV.3 The Broad Scope of Disenchantment and Its Complete Conditions  
Because saṃsāra is long and is by nature full of suffering, the complete arising of a mind of disenchantment toward all phenomena of existence is a sufficient condition leading to liberation. Toward all conditioned phenomena one should feel enough disgust and aversion; after thoroughly seeing their impermanence, suffering, and nature of inevitable relinquishment, one should feel sufficiently content not to seek lasting happiness within them. With correct observation and understanding of all objects within the six sense bases and their corresponding sense objects—including eye, visible forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and the feelings that arise conditioned by eye-contact—there will naturally arise a mind of disenchantment. For this reason, the noble disciple develops disenchantment toward the six sense spheres and thereby distances themselves from craving for the six spheres. This disenchantment covers all bodily and mental phenomena and all phenomena of action; it is a withdrawal of craving and clinging from the entire field of life experience.

IV.4 Whatever Does Not Belong to Oneself Should Be Cut Off and Abandoned  
On this path there is an important fundamental principle: whatever does not truly belong to oneself should be cut off and rejected. All things that are not one’s own should be regarded as objects that must be relinquished. If one can cut off and let go of these things that are not “mine,” one can obtain true benefit and happiness. All phenomena should be relinquished through understanding and clear comprehension. If one cannot thoroughly understand all things and has not fully comprehended them, and if one fails to cut off greed and to completely relinquish, then one cannot truly extinguish distress. Conversely, if one can thoroughly understand and completely comprehend all things, and cut off greed and thoroughly relinquish, then one can genuinely realize the extinction of distress.

IV.5 Disenchantment with the Five Aggregates and No Longer Delighting in Suffering  
If one still harbors delight and craving for the five aggregates, that is to delight in suffering, for delight in the five aggregates is identical with delight in suffering. As long as one still delights in suffering, liberation is impossible; only when one no longer delights in the five aggregates—thus, no longer delights in suffering—does it become possible to be liberated from life as constituted by the five aggregates. Therefore, because the noble disciple truthfully observes and feels aversion toward the five aggregates, they become dispassionate and ultimately attain liberation. The liberating knowledge that arises at the moment of liberation again confirms: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further becoming,” thereby assuring them that they will no longer undergo further rounds of rebirth.

V. The Realm of Liberation and the Ending of Saṃsāra  

V.1 Ending the Stream of Birth and Death and No Further Rebirth  
The key to liberation lies in ending the repeated stream of birth and death. When one stops repeatedly entering a mother’s womb, one can go beyond saṃsāra and no longer be newly bound by birth and death. Practitioners who live the holy life, cut off ignorance, and extinguish craving thereby realize the cessation of suffering; when this body breaks up at death, they are no longer reborn, and are truly freed from all sufferings such as birth, aging, sickness, and death. Regarding such a liberated state, the teaching speaks very clearly: once the root conditions binding one to saṃsāra are truly cut off, one will no longer take up a later body of becoming, nor will one endure aging and suffering in any future form of life.

V.2 Not Seeking Any Further Rebirth or Place of Existence  
One of the characteristics of one who is liberated is the cutting off of desire for any place of existence. They do not seek any form of future rebirth, including any and all forms of existence in heavenly realms. This non-seeking does not arise from denial or world-hatred, but from a thorough understanding of the nature of life and the mechanism of rebirth: no realm of rebirth can escape impermanence and suffering, so true security does not lie in changing to a different realm of existence, but in completely freeing oneself from craving and clinging.

V.3 Crossing the Flood of Birth and Death and Surmounting the Torrents  
When a person understands and practices according to the laws of liberation, they can cross over the flood of birth and death and no longer experience further rebirth in saṃsāra. Such accomplishment is described as having crossed over five torrents and then further crossed the sixth torrent. Practitioners who pass beyond these torrents frequently cultivate meditative reflection; through continuous meditation and truthful contemplation they gradually weaken the greed, hatred, and delusion in their hearts until they are completely free from all torrent-like surges and impacts. This echoes what the teaching calls “the One Vehicle path”: a path that leads practitioners across the great river of birth-and-death saṃsāra and ultimately out of the river of rebirth.

V.4 The Vast Difference Between Extinguished Suffering and Residual Suffering  
At the stage of direct vision, the amount of suffering already extinguished is immensely great, while the amount of remaining suffering is extremely small. Compared with the suffering that has been eliminated, the remaining suffering is not even one hundredth, one thousandth, or one hundred thousandth in proportion. Through correct view and direct realization, the noble disciple eliminates an enormous mass of suffering, while the amount that remains is minute, insignificant, and incomparable with what has already been extinguished. These not-yet-eliminated residual pains at most can lead to no more than seven further lives of birth and death. Extinguished suffering is vastly greater in quantity than residual suffering; the two simply cannot be mentioned in the same breath. The disparity is so great that the ratio between remaining suffering and extinguished suffering cannot be measured by arithmetic, simile, or proportion. This contrast shows that for noble disciples who have directly seen the truth, the tendency toward liberation is clear and irreversible.

V.5 Seeing Things as They Are and No Longer Taking Up Future Existence  
Through truthful realization of the truth and correct direct vision, a noble disciple is no longer bound by birth and death; having truly seen the reality of the five aggregates, they no longer take up future rounds of rebirth. Precisely because of this it can be said that in this very life they can personally realize the truth, complete the ultimate holy life, utterly cut off the cycle of birth and death, and finish all that should be learned and cultivated, never again taking up a future body of becoming. When the teaching speaks of “the extinction of this distress,” it is referring to exactly this state: all the conditions that bind one to saṃsāra have been removed, the roots of distress have been pulled out, and the continuation of saṃsāra has been completely stopped.

VI. Renunciation, the Holy Life, and Right Motivation  

VI.1 The Ultimate Goal of the Monastic Holy Life  
When a young man of good family goes forth out of faith, his aim is not worldly accomplishment, but to practice the supreme, pure holy life and in this very life to personally know, attain, and abide in the final truth. The consummation of the holy life lies in extinguishing the root defilements; such practice includes a complete holy life and careful guarding of the precepts. If one can live the holy life, cut off ignorance, and extinguish craving, one can realize the cessation of suffering, and when the body breaks up at death, one is no longer reborn, thereby liberated from all sufferings such as birth, aging, sickness, and death. The correct motivation for going forth is precisely to be freed from the fundamental sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death. If the motivation is impure and departs from this fundamental aim, one falls into a predicament of losing on both sides, obtaining neither worldly benefit nor easily accomplishing supramundane liberation.

VI.2 Keeping Precepts, Purification, and Crossing the Sea of Suffering  
Observance of precepts possesses “ultimate benefit.” Through keeping precepts one can gradually purify the defilements so that the mind is no longer dominated by coarse unwholesome actions; then one can cross over the sea of suffering that is birth and death and finally reach the further shore of ultimate purity. In this process, abandoning conceit is also extremely important. A practitioner who relinquishes conceit completely departs from the path of pride and no longer uses conceit as the standard for conduct. Such a person is called a victor and a true walker on the path; they often abide in happiness without sorrow, feeling at ease when praised, and they do not find the world narrow or cramped. This happiness does not arise from worldly sensual pleasure, but from inner purity and freedom.

VI.3 The Mind of Renunciation and the Joy of Being Far from the Dust and Noise  
In concrete practice, so-called renunciant practice means arousing a sincere mind of renunciation, willing to be far from various worldly entanglements, and dwelling in environments that are far from the dust and clamor, so that it becomes easier to experience the joy of being free from defilements. The path of liberation is therefore described as: cultivating a mind free from craving, abandoning worldly sensual pleasures, cutting off attachment, and going forth to practice. Going forth or renunciation is not necessarily limited to the external form of shaving the head; more importantly, it means that inwardly one truly wishes to relinquish attachment to worldly desires and place one’s ultimate goal in seeking and attaining inner stillness.

VI.4 Letting Go of Worldly Ties and Transcending Desire for Kin  
To truly let go of worldly ties, one must transcend the sadness arising from the loss of relatives, cut off desire for and pursuit of the opposite sex, and no longer weep and grieve over worldly matters. Genuine detachment no longer defines the self in terms of worldly huts, nests, lineages, or bonds. Traditional explanations say that the mother is considered the “house,” the wife the “nest,” children the “lineage,” and craving the “bond.” When a practitioner is truly liberated, they are no longer confined by these notions; they no longer allow the structures of “mother as house, wife as nest, children as lineage, craving as bond” to become fetters in their heart.

VII. The Many Methods of Practice and Their Liberating Benefits  

VII.1 The Four Noble Truths, Knowing Suffering, and the Central Aim of Cessation  
The core of the teaching lies in suffering and its cessation. In the past and now, the Buddha’s aim in teaching has always been the same: to enable beings to know suffering and to know the cessation of suffering. The teaching has been fully expounded, clearly revealing how to cut off bondage; its goal is the complete extinction of the mass of suffering. Within the framework of the Four Noble Truths, the “truth of cessation” states: the cessation of suffering is the complete cutting off of craving, attaining a state of dispassion, extinction, relinquishment, liberation, and non-clinging. The noble truth of the cessation of suffering further explains: the stopping of suffering lies in utterly distancing oneself from, extinguishing, relinquishing, cutting off, and freeing oneself from this craving until nothing at all is clung to. If these core tasks are accomplished, one can arrive at the complete ending of suffering.

VII.2 The Noble Eightfold Path and the Tendency of the Mind Not to Fall Back  
Continuous practice of the Noble Eightfold Path allows practitioners naturally to head toward, incline toward, and draw near to Nirvana. When the mind for a long time tends toward renunciation, it will not fall back downward; it will not turn again toward the direction of increasing defilements, but instead steadily advances toward liberation and stillness. Through such long-term cultivation, the orientation of the mind gradually becomes fixed; once the right direction is established, it is no longer easily swayed by worldly sensual pleasures.

VII.3 The Seven Factors of Awakening, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, and the Multiple Benefits of the True Path  
The practice of the seven factors of awakening has far-reaching fundamental benefits: it supports the realization of truth, supports perfect awakening, and supports liberation in Nirvana. More specifically, the seven factors of awakening support reaching the further shore, support disenchantment with the world, support the abandonment of craving, support the extinction of defilements, and support stillness and peace, so that one does not lose the true noble path that rightly leads to the cessation of suffering, thereby accomplishing the noble path of release and correctly reaching the state where suffering is fully extinguished.

The practice of the four foundations of mindfulness also has liberating benefits at its core: it helps with universal disenchantment, helps with abandoning craving, helps with extinction, helps with stillness, helps with the realization of knowledge, helps with perfect awakening, and helps with Nirvana. In actual practice, the goal of the four foundations of mindfulness is to allow the practitioner to “dwell with greed and worry regarding the world having been subdued”—to abide in a state in which attachment to and worry over the world have been tamed. For this reason the genuine noble path is called the “true path”: it supports disenchantment, supports abandoning craving, supports extinction, supports stillness, supports realization of knowledge, supports perfect awakening, and supports Nirvana. At the same time, it can also be said that this path aids constant disenchantment, aids abandonment of craving, aids extinction, aids stillness, aids realization of knowledge, aids perfect awakening, and aids Nirvana; it is the inevitable direction leading to Nirvana.

VII.4 The One Vehicle Path, the Five Faculties, and Other Supports for Practice  
This One Vehicle path is described as a road that can lead practitioners across the torrent of birth and death; it enables those not yet crossed over to cross over, those not yet liberated to be liberated. The cultivation of the five faculties—faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom—can bring one to the ultimate deathless, orient one toward the deathless, and fulfill the deathless, and can give rise, except in times when the Buddha has not appeared in the world or when the discipline is not maintained, to the noble path not yet arisen. Practice of the five faculties helps to cut off bondage, to forever end latent defilements, to fully understand the route of saṃsāra, and to extinguish all defilements.

Beyond the four foundations of mindfulness there are other methods, such as four ways that lead to pure liberation; these can guide beings who have not yet reached purity to move toward purity, and those who have not yet reached a white, stainless state to move toward such purity. There are also certain important stages of accomplishment that are regarded as processes flowing toward the further shore of liberation and as supports leading to the extinction of all defilements.

VII.5 Simple Living and Four Fundamental Principles  
Even if one lives simply, relying only on the most basic food and clothing, as long as a noble disciple can accomplish four fundamental principles, they can be freed from all destinies in bad realms. This shows that liberation does not center on material conditions but on whether the heart is endowed with four key qualities of the true Dhamma. A noble disciple who possesses these four qualities has already fixed the direction of their life; their life is sure to aim toward Nirvana, incline toward Nirvana, and draw near to Nirvana, no longer falling in the opposite direction.

VII.6 Practice, Knowing Suffering, Rest, and Release from Guilt  
The purpose of practice is to fully know the nature of suffering and to reach genuine rest. This “rest” means to truthfully know the arising and ceasing, the sweetness and danger, and the way of escape regarding the six contact-bases; on this basis, “supreme rest” means that, founded on truthful knowledge, one reaches a state of liberation without clinging. At the same time, a practitioner should clearly know that there is a path of release from guilt and wrongdoing, and having clearly known this path, decide whether or not they will tread it. This choice shows that each person’s practice of the path of liberation ultimately requires themselves to choose responsibly and bear the consequences.

VII.7 Four Fundamental Liberative Principles and Freedom from Bad Realms  
Besides the above methods, there are four fundamental principles of liberation. If a noble disciple can accomplish these four, then even if their living conditions are simple and they rely only on the most basic food and clothing, they can be freed from the destinies of various bad realms. These principles keep the practitioner far from falling into woeful states and firmly standing on the side that moves toward liberation.

VIII. Dependent Origination, the Cessation of Ignorance, and the Authority of the Teaching  

VIII.1 The Cessation of Ignorance and the Stopping of Bodily, Verbal, and Mental Kamma  
Within the structure of dependent origination, ignorance is one of the fundamental conditions of suffering. When ignorance ceases, bodily, verbal, and mental actions no longer give rise to new suffering and pleasure, because the bodily, verbal, and mental actions that create suffering and pleasure are no longer driven by ignorance. When ignorance is utterly extinguished, suffering and pleasure have no place to arise; the entire mechanism by which suffering and pleasure revolve thereby comes to a halt. This explains why cutting off ignorance is the key to eliminating the root of suffering.

VIII.2 Four Cognitions of Dependent Origination and Transcending Aging and Death  
There are four crucial kinds of cognition closely related to the laws of dependent origination. Those who possess these four cognitions can reach the liberated state that transcends aging and death; conversely, those who lack these four cognitions cannot attain such a liberated state. This shows the importance of correct understanding: if one cannot correctly grasp the conditions that give rise to life and suffering, it is very difficult to withdraw from them.

VIII.3 The Teaching Fully Proclaimed and Its Central Aim  
The teaching proclaimed by the Buddha has already been completely and perfectly expounded; its content clearly points out how to cut off bondage. The correctness of the teaching lies in the fact that it does not vaguely speak of liberation, but lucidly reveals the causes of bondage and the way to cut them off, with the ultimate goal of the complete extinction of the mass of suffering. In the past and at present, this central teaching has never changed; it always revolves around these two great themes: “to make suffering known” and “to make the cessation of suffering known,” enabling beings, while understanding suffering, also to understand how suffering can be eliminated.

VIII.4 Understanding and Relinquishment as Two Sides of One Reality  
If one merely forcibly suppresses or rejects all phenomena without truly and thoroughly understanding and fully comprehending them, one cannot genuinely cut off greed and completely relinquish. Thus, the reason one cannot extinguish distress lies in the failure to thoroughly understand all things, to fully comprehend them, to cut off greed, and to completely relinquish. Conversely, the reason one can exhaust suffering lies in being able to thoroughly understand and fully comprehend all things, and thereby to cut off greed and completely relinquish. Relinquishment is not blind abandonment; it is founded on deep understanding. Only through such understanding and comprehension can one truly see that in all phenomena there is nothing that can be clung to, and thus naturally let go.

VIII.5 Impermanence and the Nature of Inevitable Relinquishment  
Understanding the nature of the world is also manifested in the correct cognition of impermanence. To correctly understand impermanence is to recognize that all phenomena have the nature of being inevitably relinquished—whether the body, feelings, emotions, wealth, or relationships, none can abide for long. Taking this recognition as a basis, practitioners give rise to deep realization and then, in actual life, engage in the practice of relinquishment. This practice is not a passive negation but an active adjustment of the mind, so that one no longer relies on things that must eventually be relinquished as the foundation of one’s sense of security.

IX. The Inner State of the Liberated and Awareness at Life’s End  

IX.1 The Fruits of Practice: Transcending Sorrow and Escaping Bondage  
When the fruits of practice are accomplished, one of their characteristics is “liberated from bondage”—no longer pulled by defilements. Another is “transcending sorrow,” far removed from all sorrow and lamentation, and finally “realizing Nirvana,” obtaining the fruit of unshakable peace. In accordance with the laws that lead to liberation, genuine liberates not only pass beyond many torrents and the flood of birth and death, but can also in this very life experience inner stability and freedom. In their course of practice, because they maintain a lucid distance from the nature of suffering, they can remain free of sorrow amid sorrow; even in hardship they are no longer dragged about by inner grief.

IX.2 Letting Go of Worldly Sorrow and Sensual Desire  
One core aspect of liberation is relinquishing the sorrow and sensual desire brought by worldly ties. Transcending the grief that arises from losing relatives, cutting off desire for and pursuit of the opposite sex, and no longer weeping and grieving over worldly affairs—all these belong to the domain of relinquishment. When these emotions and desires are clearly seen and put down, the heart can become calm and no longer agitated, not easily moved by the gains and losses of life.

IX.3 Not Seeking Rebirth and No Longer Attached to Places of Existence  
The liberated do not seek any form of further rebirth, including all heavenly realms as places of existence. Because desire for any realm of existence has been cut off, they no longer search within the six realms for better or worse destinations, but instead put all emphasis on complete renunciation and liberation. From this perspective, the so-called “deathless” state does not mean physical immortality, but a condition in which one no longer dies and is reborn within saṃsāra.

IX.4 Boundary-Feelings and Awareness at the Time of Death  
In the course of practice, practitioners become aware of “boundary-feelings” of life. When they sense that the body has reached its limit, they know truthfully that this is the feeling of the body reaching its boundary; when they sense that life has reached its limit, they truthfully know that this is the feeling of life reaching its boundary. When the body decays and life ends, if they possess liberating wisdom, they can clearly know that everything they have experienced and delighted in in this life will all subside into stillness. Such awareness prevents them from being thrown into panic at the end of life; instead, they face the body’s disintegration and the cessation of all feelings with clarity and calm.

IX.5 Guidance Toward Nirvana and Passing Beyond Māra’s Evil Paths  
The Dhamma that guides toward Nirvana has its fundamental characteristics. It frees practitioners from all defilements, leaving them without fear in any place, and cuts all fetters and bonds. The specific path of deliverance includes: crossing the torrent of birth and death, breaking the evil paths of Māra, and surpassing all views—that is, going beyond all wrong views and biased perspectives. When these practices are completed, practitioners are no longer dragged along by the cycle of birth and death or by destinies in bad realms.

X. Renunciation, the Nature of the World, and the Essential Conditions for the Cessation of Suffering  

X.1 Abandoning All Worldly Desires and Defilements  
A fundamental principle of renunciation and purification states that one should abandon all worldly desires and inner defilements and uproot all clinging in order to attain unbound freedom. Whatever does not truly belong to oneself should be rejected; giving up these things that are not “mine” brings genuine benefit and happiness. Such relinquishment is also a response to the nature of the world: since all conditioned phenomena are inevitably impermanent and bound to be relinquished, letting them go inwardly in advance is the wise choice that leads to liberation.

X.2 The End of the World and Transcending the World of the Six Sense Bases  
To end suffering one must reach the end of the world, but this “end” is not found by exploring the outer boundary of the world. One cannot know the nature of the world by searching for an external edge; instead, one must transcend the world constructed by cognition through the six sense bases. When a practitioner, within this very body-and-mind, truthfully understands the arising of the world and its result, as well as the cessation of the world and the path leading to that cessation, they have, within their own experience, reached the end of the world. This is why the teaching repeatedly emphasizes: do not focus on the outer limit of space, but return to the mind and to bodily and mental phenomena themselves.

X.3 The Conditions of the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering and a Summary  
In summary, the stopping of suffering consists in completely distancing oneself from, extinguishing, relinquishing, and cutting off craving, thereby attaining a state of liberation and non-clinging. If one fails to thoroughly understand all things, to fully comprehend them, to cut off greed, and to completely relinquish, one cannot truly extinguish distress. Conversely, if one truthfully understands and comprehends them and thereby cuts off greed and relinquishes, one can genuinely realize the extinction of suffering. When all these conditions are fulfilled, what the teaching calls “the extinction of distress” is no longer a mere concept but a fact that can be personally realized in this very life.

XI. Associating with Good Friends, Listening to the Teaching, and Peace of Mind  

XI.1 The Liberating Benefits of Associating with Good Friends  
Associating with good friends brings many benefits. With the companionship and guidance of good friends, practitioners can remain free of sorrow amid sorrow and learn, in various adversities, how to keep the mind from being swallowed by distress. At the same time, the presence of good friends brings happiness to many, because they mutually support one another with the true Dhamma, so that none lose their way on the path of practice. Associating with good friends is also regarded as an important condition for being freed from all suffering, because in such an environment right view and right conduct are constantly reminded and protected.

XI.2 Hearing the Pure Teaching and Peace of Heart  
Through seeing the noble truths one can be freed from saṃsāra; and by hearing a pure, undefiled teaching, people find peace of heart. When a practitioner hears a truly undefiled Dhamma, their mind naturally comes to rest, because they see the path of liberation behind the sufferings of life. This calm is not just a fleeting emotional soothing; it arises from trust in and understanding of the truth.

XII. Fruits of Practice, the Noble Path, and Orientation Toward Nirvana  

XII.1 The Combined Benefits of Practicing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Five Faculties, and the Seven Factors of Awakening  
The practice of the four foundations of mindfulness is regarded as a crucial path leading to Nirvana; it aids constant disenchantment, helps in abandoning craving, aids extinction, aids stillness, aids realization of knowledge, aids perfect awakening, and aids Nirvana. Practicing the five faculties can lead to the ultimate deathless, orient one toward the deathless, and fulfill the deathless; it also helps to cut off bondage, forever end latent defilements, fully understand the route of saṃsāra, and extinguish all defilements. The practice of the seven factors of awakening supports realization of truth, supports perfect awakening, and supports liberation in Nirvana; at the same time, it supports reaching the further shore, supports disenchantment with the world, supports abandoning craving, supports extinguishing defilements, and supports stillness and peace, so that practitioners do not lose the noble path that rightly leads to the cessation of suffering, and finally accomplish the noble path of release, correctly reaching the full ending of suffering.

XII.2 The One Vehicle Path and the Four Ways to Purity  
The One Vehicle path is a road that can lead beings across the torrent of birth and death in saṃsāra; it emphasizes guiding practitioners with one single, genuine direction toward liberation. In addition, there are four ways that can lead to pure liberation; they guide beings who have not yet reached purity to move toward purity, and beings who have not yet reached a spotless state to move toward that spotless condition. These ways echo the One Vehicle path and together constitute a ladder of practice from ordinary person to noble disciple.

XII.3 Stages of Accomplishment and the Further Shore of Liberation  
Certain attainments in practice are described as “processes flowing toward the further shore of liberation”; they are supports that lead to the extinction of all defilements. These attainments are not the final goal themselves, but reliable bridges to the final goal. When these staged accomplishments are one by one fulfilled, the practitioner step by step draws nearer to Nirvana. Ultimately, through completing these core tasks, they arrive at the complete ending of suffering.

XIII. General Principles of Liberation and Transcending the Darkness of the World  

XIII.1 The Essential Heart of Liberation and the Arising of Disenchantment  
Because saṃsāra is long and filled with suffering, the essential heart of liberation lies in feeling sufficient disgust and disenchantment toward all conditioned phenomena, and, after seeing their impermanent and suffering nature, feeling sufficiently content not to seek ultimate security within them. By observing the impermanent and suffering nature of all the above categories of bodily and mental phenomena and giving rise to a mind of disenchantment, one can withdraw from craving for them and thereby attain liberation. This disenchantment accords with right view: it is a profound mind of renunciation born from clearly seeing the dark elements of life—birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

XIII.2 Conclusion: From Knowing Suffering to the Cessation of Suffering  
To summarize the overall doctrine, the Buddha’s teaching is nothing more than enabling beings to know suffering and to know the cessation of suffering. Through a truthful understanding of aging and death and the nature of life, and through a thorough understanding of the relationship between the five aggregates, craving, and ignorance, practitioners give rise to disenchantment, distance themselves from greed, and finally attain liberation. All methods of practice—whether the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the four foundations of mindfulness, the five faculties, the seven factors of awakening, the One Vehicle path, or other paths of purity—support one and the same goal: to lead beings out of the darkness of birth and death in saṃsāra, to realize Nirvana, and to bring about the complete extinction of distress.
