<title> Impermanence, Suffering, and Non‑Self: The Nature of the World and the Path to Liberation </title>
<article>
I. Worldly Sense Pleasures and the Impermanent State of All Phenomena

All actions and phenomena in the world are, in their very nature, impermanent. They bear the characteristic of arising and ceasing; whatever has arisen cannot escape change and destruction. Within this fundamental fact, if someone still clings to worldly sense pleasures and takes these fleeting, changing sensory enjoyments as a dependable reality, this is delusion, because what he grasps is nothing but formations that are bound to arise and cease. The whole world itself abides in a highly unstable state: everything seems to be burning, filled everywhere with smoke, constantly spewing forth flames and ceaselessly trembling, as if there were not a single moment of genuine calm.

The nature of all phenomena is impermanence and inevitable change. They must go through the process of arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing; whatever existence has arisen must ultimately move toward decline and extinction. All the various factors that make up beings’ experiences—whether past, future, or present—are all marked by impermanence, change, and instability. There is not a single dharma that can depart from change. All existences in the world are in unceasing alteration and transformation; nothing whatsoever can be exempt from this law. Every form of change is only a different expression of birth, aging, sickness, and death, or of destruction, disappearance, arising, and final extinction; even sorrow and defilement are likewise phenomena of change. Since all existence is inevitably a law of transformation, this transforming characteristic pervades all the elements that constitute experience, without any exception.

Therefore, all bodily and mental phenomena are impermanent, and whatever is impermanent is suffering. All conditioned dharmas are impermanent, and all impermanent dharmas as such are suffering. Based on this understanding, one should not mistakenly regard any phenomena that are impermanent, suffering, and changing as “what I possess,” “I,” or “my self,” but should turn away from such clinging. Since there does not exist in the world any self‑nature with an eternal and unchanging essence, all activities and phenomena will eventually pass away and cease; the nature of all existence is nothing but impermanence, non‑eternity, and instability. If there truly were some eternal and unchanging principle, then all practice would be incapable of bringing suffering to an end. Precisely because all things lack any permanent self‑nature, practice can in fact lead to liberation.

II. Nibbāna’s Quiescence and the True Characteristics of All Dharmas

In all conditioned formations, the true nature of impermanent arising and ceasing is without exception revealed; as long as it is a dharma that has arisen, it must inevitably move toward cessation. Thus, within the stream of the arising and passing away of all dharmas, taking quiescent extinction as the ultimate happiness becomes a clear orientation: only the quiescent state that transcends arising and ceasing and is free from change can be called true happiness. From this perspective, all phenomena share three universal characteristics: impermanence, suffering, and non‑self. These are the fundamental laws of phenomena and the comprehensive summary and conclusion concerning the true reality of all dharmas.

Under this law one can understand: whatever is impermanent is suffering, and whatever is suffering is non‑self. Whatever is non‑self ought to be rightly known as “this is not mine, not I, not my self,” and no longer mistakenly taken as a graspable entity. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is non‑self; what is non‑self is not mine, not I, not my self. This logical sequence reveals the tightly interlinked meaning among the three marks (the three characteristics, trilakṣaṇa). For any dharma that is impermanent, suffering, and decaying, one should not generate the cognition “this is what I possess, this is I, this is my self,” because all such dharmas are only temporary aggregates that will in the end fall apart.

Thus all phenomena are not only impermanent, suffering, and non‑self, but are also burdensome and oppressive, forming a heavy load upon beings. Faced with such a nature, all phenomena ought to be understood, fully known, relinquished, and realized in their true reality: to understand their conditionality and their arising and ceasing, to know well their state of suffering, emptiness, and non‑self, and thereby, through wisdom, abandon craving and attachment to them, directly realizing the peace of quiescence. Whatever is impermanent and suffering is a decaying dharma; therefore, regarding such impermanent, suffering, and decaying dharmas, one should in body, mind, and thought no longer cling to them as “what I possess,” “I,” or “my self.”

III. Establishing Right View: Contemplating the Arising and Ceasing of Impermanence and Suffering as They Are

To establish right view in the midst of such reality, one must first contemplate, as they really are, all worldly phenomena carried by the earth and covered by space, and through this thoroughly know that all existence possesses the nature of impermanence and aging. The wise abide according to such a view and no longer regard the changing world as a reliable refuge. Since all formations are impermanent and subject to arising and ceasing, the practitioner must understand this and make good use of this knowledge to maintain mindfulness and clear comprehension, thereby counteracting various defilements. When suffering arises, one should clearly see the arising of suffering; when suffering ceases, one should see, just as it is, the cessation of suffering, without generating confusion or doubt therein. In this way, wisdom naturally arises, and understanding of suffering gradually deepens.

To know, as they truly are, the origination of the world and the cessation of the world is one part of a noble disciple’s vision of wisdom; that is, being able to accurately see the conditions for the gathering of worldly suffering and the conditions for the cessation of suffering. Such a vision of wisdom is likewise founded on insight into impermanence: all the factors that constitute beings’ experiences—past, present, and future—are impermanent, changing, and unstable. Practitioners should know of all dharmas their arising, ceasing, and alteration, and apply this knowing universally to the five basic categories that constitute the experience of life, namely, form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness.

For the past five aggregates that have already ceased and perished, one should be able to review them and know, just as they were, their former arising, ceasing, and alteration. For the future five aggregates that have not yet arisen or manifested, one should be able to foresee and understand that they too will eventually go through arising, ceasing, and alteration. For the present five aggregates that have already arisen and are now manifest, one should be aware of their arising, ceasing, and alteration in the very moment, without negligence. In this way, by attending to the five aggregates in accordance with reality and contemplating their impermanent nature as it is, one can arouse disenchantment and the mind of renunciation with respect to conditioned dharmas.

In order to establish the knowledge that leads to liberation, one must contemplate, as they truly are, the changing characteristics of all things in the world and understand that change is a universally present natural law. With right wisdom one should directly contemplate the nature of all phenomena, bringing the inner six faculties and the outer six sense objects entirely within the scope of contemplation, taking impermanence, suffering, and non‑self as the core discernments of this contemplation. One must understand that all dharmas, past, present, and future, have the nature of impermanence, suffering, and non‑self, and that the various present dharmas in particular should be the main focus of contemplation. When contemplating and relinquishing, the practitioner must firmly grasp the characteristic of impermanence and clearly see that all phenomena—including the six faculties, six sense objects, six consciousnesses, six contacts, and the feelings born of the six contacts—without exception are impermanent.

In terms of the grasp of time and place, the practitioner should contemplate with an equal mind, abiding with mindfulness on “before and after,” so that what comes later is like what came before, and what came before is like what comes later; what is above is like what is below, what is below is like what is above; night is like day, and day is like night. One should not give rise to discriminating grasping between before and after, above and below, day and night, but only see the equal characteristic of impermanence and arising‑and‑ceasing. Because whatever is impermanent is suffering, and whatever is suffering is non‑self, therefore, for all dharmas that are non‑self, one should recognize them as “this is not mine, not I, not my self.” This is the fundamental cognitive principle that should be upheld in contemplation.

IV. Dependent Origination and the Decaying Nature of Conditioned Dharmas

Whatever dharmas are produced by causes and conditions share certain inseparable characteristics: they are impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, and they are dharmas subject to extinguishing and decay, as well as dharmas that lead away from craving and toward cessation. That is to say, all dharmas that are born, formed, and conditioned have the nature of destruction and decay; as long as there is arising, fabrication, and formation, they must in the end disperse. Separation from the people and things one loves is not accidental, but an inevitable manifestation produced by this law of conditioned and dependently arisen phenomena.

Even existences that appear as solid as great trees will first have their branches decay and will in the end wither and topple over. The final nibbāna of a noble disciple also appears in the world like the breaking of a great branch, showing that even the highest noble ones, in terms of their conditioned body and mind, do not abide permanently in the world. Thus, all that is born, formed, conditioned, and subject to destruction cannot possibly abide forever without change. This universal law applies to all things born of causes and conditions, without any exception. For this reason, something permanently abiding and unchanging is in fact impossible within the realm of conditioned phenomena.

All feelings also do not fall outside this scope. The three kinds of feelings—whether pleasant, painful, or neutral—fundamentally have the characteristics of impermanence, conditionedness, and dependent origination. They arise dependent on conditions and cease when conditions cease. These feelings must inevitably move toward destruction and disappearance, and ultimately must incline toward dispassion and extinction. In fact, all feelings have their roots in impermanent and changing phenomena, while all phenomena themselves are dharmas that tend toward destruction, disappearance, dispassion, extinction, and decay. Therefore, as soon as one experiences the impermanence of feelings, one can see that they cannot serve as a firm place of happiness, and thereby draw near to dispassion.

From a broader perspective, all existence is necessarily a law of transformation, and this change universally pervades all the factors that constitute experience. Birth, aging, sickness, and death are all laws of transformation; destruction, disappearance, arising, and final cessation are also laws of transformation; even sorrow and defilement are merely different forms in which transformation is displayed. Facing such reality, practitioners are taught to contemplate, just as they are, that all dharmas which arise are dharmas which cease: to see in arising the tendency toward extinction, and in the flow of conditioned and dependently arisen processes, directly realize the direction of decay and dispassion.

V. The Impermanence, Suffering, and Non‑Self of the Five Aggregates

The five aggregates that constitute the experience of life—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—at any given time display their inescapably suffering nature. All past, future, and present form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are suffering, because all impermanent dharmas are suffering, and the five aggregates are precisely dharmas of change. Form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are impermanent; their very nature is that of impermanent dharmas; no matter which aggregate, none escapes alteration and decay. These aggregates are also dharmas of exhaustion, decay, and accumulation. That is to say, the five aggregates gather and arise, and must also proceed toward exhaustion and decay; their very gathering already foretells their future disbanding.

Since within any part of the five aggregates there is not the slightest element that is permanent, constant, eternally abiding, and unchanging, one can be certain that the five aggregates are completely an impermanent composite. No part of form is permanent, constant, eternally abiding, and unchanging; no part of feeling is permanent, constant, eternally abiding, and unchanging; no part of perception is permanent, constant, eternally abiding, and unchanging; no part of formations is permanent, constant, eternally abiding, and unchanging; and no part of consciousness is permanent, constant, eternally abiding, and unchanging. The law of impermanence universally applies to each aggregate within the five, and there is no exception within them that can abide forever without change. Therefore, form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are also dharmas that will perish; all conditioned aggregates can only move toward destruction.

Based on all this, if we reason it out, we may say: whatever is impermanent is suffering, whatever is suffering is non‑self, and whatever is non‑self cannot be “what I possess,” cannot be “I,” cannot be “my self.” Since the five aggregates are impermanent, and impermanence is suffering, therefore all dharmas of the five aggregates are suffering. Being suffering, they are non‑self, and so should no longer be clung to as “I” or “what is mine.” Whatever is impermanent, suffering, and changing must be regarded as not mine, not I, and not my essence. This contemplation should be widely applied to all five aggregates, whether past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near; all should be contemplated in this way.

On a deeper level, all bodily and mental phenomena are impermanent, and impermanent phenomena are suffering; therefore, the five aggregates, as the sum of body and mind, naturally cannot be apart from suffering. All impermanent dharmas are suffering; the five aggregates are dharmas of change, so one should not cling to these suffering and changing dharmas. Whatever is impermanent is suffering; on the five aggregates this should be especially well understood. Precisely because within the five aggregates there is no part that is permanent, constant, eternally abiding, and unchanging, a person who practices the pure holy life on the basis of the five aggregates can completely extinguish all suffering. If there were even a single portion within the five aggregates that were permanent and unchanging, then suffering could never be utterly brought to an end.

Since form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are impermanent, and whatever is impermanent is suffering, therefore all experiences of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness bear the nature of suffering. Whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, obtained, sought, or even secretly intended by the mind is entirely impermanent, and impermanence is suffering; there is nothing whatsoever that can serve as an eternal abode of happiness. From this we can also see that the five aggregates are not only impermanent, but also suffering and dharmas of change, and thus they should not be objects of any further clinging.

VI. The Impermanence of the Six Faculties, Six Sense Objects, and the Whole Cognitive Process

From the sense faculties and external objects, to the mind and the cognitive process, the entire structure of bodily and mental activity likewise falls completely within impermanence. The six faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind; the six sense objects of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects; and the corresponding consciousnesses that arise with them—eye‑consciousness, ear‑consciousness, nose‑consciousness, tongue‑consciousness, body‑consciousness, and mind‑consciousness—are all merely dharmas that ceaselessly change. Eye‑contact, ear‑contact, nose‑contact, tongue‑contact, body‑contact, and mind‑contact—the cognitive processes themselves—are also impermanent. The various feelings that arise from these contacts are likewise without exception governed by impermanence.

More specifically, the six faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are impermanent; the six sense objects of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are also impermanent; the six consciousnesses and the six contacts are the same. Whatever feelings arise from the six contacts, whether pleasant, painful, or neutral, are all impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is suffering; thus the six faculties, the six sense objects, and all consciousnesses and contacts that arise from them are all stamped with the nature of suffering.

This characteristic of impermanence applies not only to the present but also to the past and future. The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, together with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—whether in the past, present, or future—are in nature impermanent, suffering, and non‑self. Therefore, the six faculties and the six sense objects at any time and in any place can never become “I” or “what is mine.” This point echoes the earlier contemplation of the five aggregates, making it clear that in the entire structure of bodily, mental, and worldly experience, nowhere can an eternal, unchanging self‑nature be found.

The impermanence of the six faculties, six sense objects, and six consciousnesses can also be explained from another angle: since the nature of the faculties and the objects is impermanent, they must decay and change; the consciousness that arises dependent on these impermanent faculties and objects is in its nature likewise impermanent and subject to decay and change; within the interdependent arising of faculties, objects, and consciousness, contact itself is also an impermanent dharma of decay and change. For this very reason, all feelings and subsequent mental activities that arise through contact must, without exception, undergo arising, ceasing, and decay.

In more detailed classifications, the range of impermanence further includes the faculties themselves, the objects, consciousness, contact, feeling, concepts, volitions, craving, elements, and all bodily‑mental aggregates. Specifically: the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are impermanent; sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are impermanent; eye‑consciousness, ear‑consciousness, nose‑consciousness, tongue‑consciousness, body‑consciousness, and mind‑consciousness are impermanent; eye‑contact, ear‑contact, nose‑contact, tongue‑contact, body‑contact, and mind‑contact are impermanent; the feelings born of eye‑contact, of ear‑contact, of nose‑contact, of tongue‑contact, of body‑contact, and of mind‑contact are all impermanent; perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are impermanent; volitions with respect to sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are impermanent; craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects is impermanent; the earth element, water element, fire element, wind element, space element, and consciousness element are impermanent; and the entire bodily‑mental aggregate of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness is also impermanent.

All the dharmas in the above categories share a common characteristic: impermanence, that is, ceaseless alteration and change. When contemplating these faculties, objects, consciousnesses, contacts, and feelings, one must recognize that they all are impermanent; because they are impermanent, they are suffering; and whatever is impermanent, suffering, and decaying should no longer be regarded as “this is what I possess, this is I, this is my self.” Under such understanding, one can truly realize that the very nature of suffering is precisely the six sense bases, that is, the six points of contact of the faculties with their objects: eye‑base, ear‑base, nose‑base, tongue‑base, body‑base, and mind‑base. The impermanence and suffering of the six sense bases themselves are exactly what the noble truth of suffering is pointing to at its core.

VII. The Suffering Nature of the Body and Feelings and Their Direction

Regarding the body, what is called “suffering” refers to this body which is formed by the four great elements, born of father and mother, and dependent on food for its maintenance. In its nature it bears the characteristics of impermanence, erosion, wearing away, damage, and disintegration. The existence of the body is only a temporary combination of the four great elements; it is at every moment in decline, and any state that appears healthy and solid is in fact constantly being worn away and eroded.

As for feelings, whether pleasant, painful, or neutral, all three share the fundamental characteristics of impermanence, conditionedness, and dependent origination. They arise dependent on conditions and cease when conditions cease, without any self‑nature to be found. These feelings must inevitably move toward destruction and disappearance, and ultimately proceed to dispassion and extinction. All feelings arise from impermanent and changing phenomena; every feeling is only a temporary manifestation upon the basis of impermanent dharmas, and all phenomena themselves operate according to the law of destruction, disappearance, dispassion, extinction, and decay, without any exception.

Therefore, one must understand that all impermanent dharmas are suffering; whatever is impermanent is suffering. The five aggregates are dharmas of change, so feelings must likewise be dharmas of change. Given this, one should not cling to these suffering and changing dharmas as places of happiness or as reliable refuges. For all objects of cognition, one must likewise recognize their nature as it truly is: they are all without exception impermanent; because they are impermanent, they are suffering; and toward these impermanent and suffering objects one should not generate any attachment.

VIII. The Contemplation of Impermanence, the Cutting Off of Craving, and the Practice of Liberation

In practice, cultivating the contemplation of impermanence toward all formations is the key that leads toward light and wisdom. When practitioners cultivate the perception of impermanence with respect to all formations, from this there arises the perception of suffering: from experiencing impermanence, they see the suffering nature of all that must finally decay; and from the perception of suffering they further arouse the perception of non‑self, realizing that behind this impermanence and suffering there is no self that can be grasped. As the experience of impermanence, suffering, and non‑self becomes more and more profound, practitioners cultivate the perception of disconnection (the perception of cutting off), that is, cutting off the various attachments and continuing tendencies associated with these conditioned dharmas; next they cultivate the perception of dispassion, gradually moving away from craving for the five sensual pleasures and for existence; and ultimately develop the perception of extinction and abide in it, dwelling peacefully in the contemplation of ending and quiescence.

Throughout this entire process, the perception of impermanence has exceptionally far‑reaching benefits. When impermanence is deeply realized, one can forever exhaust all sensual craving, cutting off fascination with the objects of the five senses; at the same time one can forever exhaust all craving for form, no longer clinging to the physical body and material forms; one can forever exhaust all craving for existence, no longer craving any state of being or becoming; one can forever exhaust all ignorance and no longer be deluded about the true reality of dharmas; and one can also forever cut off all conceit regarding a “self,” completely letting go of the sense of superiority and solidity of “I.” Because whatever is impermanent should be freed from desire, craving, and sensual greed; whatever is suffering should likewise be freed from desire, craving, and sensual greed; and whatever is non‑self should also be freed from desire, craving, and sensual greed, therefore, in any contemplation of impermanence, suffering, and non‑self, the genuine direction is always the cutting off of craving and the cultivation of dispassion.

All phenomena in the world are impermanent and not lasting; in the end they must be abandoned, and there is nothing that can be possessed for long. Thus, regarding all the objects of contemplation mentioned earlier—including body and mind, the five aggregates, the six sense bases, and even various conditioned dharmas of dependent origination—one should contemplate them through these three right views: impermanence, suffering, and non‑self. When facing all the lovable and delightful appearances of the world, practitioners must know that, for one who seeks liberation, these pleasant aspects are like thorns in front, behind, and on all sides; if one is not alert and guarded, one will be pricked and wounded by them. Therefore, one must know clearly when guarding is needed and when one is in a state of non‑guarding, and at all times bring forth right mindfulness regarding impermanence and danger.

When, from impermanence, one draws out suffering and non‑self, one naturally understands: whatever is impermanent is suffering; whatever is impermanent, suffering, and decaying should no longer be regarded as “this is what I possess, this is I, this is my self.” From this angle, looking back, all that is born, formed, conditioned, and subject to destruction in the world possesses the characteristic of decay. Whatever has arisen, been fabricated, and formed must disperse; separation from those whom one loves is an inevitable phenomenon. Even something as solid as a great tree will first have its branches decay; the final nibbāna of a noble disciple is likewise like the breaking of a great branch, revealing that within the conditioned realm, permanent abiding is in truth impossible.

Over the long course of saṃsāra, the total amount of blood and tears beings have shed through various forms and circumstances far exceeds the waters of the four great oceans. This accumulation of suffering shows that saṃsāra itself is filled with pressure and oppression by suffering. Mountains, rivers, and the great earth, together with the beings upon it—their lifespans and their ways of life—will all change and disappear over time, and there is no enduring form that can be spoken of. Even the Enlightened Ones and noble disciples ultimately manifest nibbāna, and their appearance in the world also comes to an end. All this again confirms the earlier conclusion: all that is born, formed, conditioned, and subject to destruction cannot abide constantly without change; this is a universal law applicable to all things born of causes and conditions.

Finally, the overall view of all phenomena is that they are impermanent, suffering, and non‑self. All phenomena must be understood, fully known, relinquished, and realized, because they are entirely burdens and oppressive loads. By directly contemplating with right wisdom, from the understanding of impermanence arises comprehension of suffering; from the comprehension of suffering one thoroughly sees non‑self; and on this basis one cultivates the perception of cutting off, the perception of dispassion, and the perception of extinction and abides in them. This is the path that leads from the conditioned to the unconditioned, from oppression by suffering to the quiescence of liberation.
