<title> The Acquisition, Use, and Attitude Toward Wealth: An Integrated View of Karma and Contentment </title>

I. Proper and Improper Results of Using Wealth  

I.1 Results Brought by Proper Use of Wealth  

When a person is able to use wealth in a proper way, the wealth itself manifests a stable and beneficial condition. Specifically, such wealth will not be confiscated by the king, will not be seized by thieves, will not be destroyed by fire, and will not be swept away by floods. Moreover, it will not fall into the hands of heirs whose line of continuity one dislikes and does not rejoice in, but will instead, in accordance with one’s wish, be passed on within an appropriate line of inheritance.  

Functionally speaking, such wealth is useful: it can be well employed, does not become the basis for actions that lead to ruin, and does not give rise to conduct that corrupts body, mind, and family estate. Rather, it can long support a proper life and the practice of wholesome deeds.  

I.2 Results Brought by Improper Use of Wealth  

Conversely, if a person uses wealth improperly, the wealth itself will exhibit a series of results of decline and loss. Such wealth is easily subject to taxation or confiscation by the king; it often becomes an object of coveting and plunder by thieves; it may be burned up in fires or swept away in floods. In addition, it may be taken over by heirs whose line of continuity one dislikes and does not rejoice in, falling into the hands of successors other than those one had hoped for.  

As for its outcome, such wealth ultimately becomes useless: it not only fails to benefit oneself and others, but even becomes the support for actions that bring about ruin, used to sustain various behaviors that corrupt body, mind, and family estate, causing the wealth itself to lose its proper function and value.  

II. Characteristics of Karma’s Operation and the Dispersal of External Wealth  

Wealth and external possessions, under the operation of karma, inevitably possess a dispersive and impermanent nature. As for the principle of the dispersal of external things, whether gold and silver treasures, or slaves, servants, and any kind of external possession, all will, in the end, leave us and cannot remain in our hands for long.  

This dispersal is not only the impermanence of material things themselves, but is also related to a person’s actions, karma, and mental attitude. No matter how secure and firm wealth may presently appear, it can never ultimately avoid change and loss. This should lead people, when facing wealth, to recognize more clearly its nature as something unreliable and not to be clung to.  

III. Cultivating Contentment and the Correct Attitude Toward Life’s Requisites  

III.1 The Way of Contentment in Facing Life’s Requisites  

In the process of cultivating “contentment,” one should maintain a clear and correct attitude toward the requisites of life. First, with regard to any requisites one obtains, one should feel satisfied, and be able to praise and affirm this sense of contentment—measuring one’s joy not by poverty or abundance, but by whether or not one is content, and letting this determine the spaciousness of one’s heart.  

Second, when facing various requisites, one should not, for the sake of seeking or keeping them, fall into improper or unsuitable behavior, and should not allow the pursuit and enjoyment of wealth to become a reason for violating the right path.  

When one has not yet obtained the requisites one hopes for, one’s mind should not therefore be shaken; one should not give rise to affliction and anxiety because of lack, but instead maintain a stable and lucid mind. When one actually gains these requisites, one should not give rise to clinging and greed, should not regard them as the root of all happiness, and should not let the mind be dragged about by them.  

In facing requisites, one must also avoid delusion and indulgence, and be able to perceive their faults, seeing the bonds and dangers that wealth and enjoyment may bring in the background. Finally, one should contemplate and enjoy these requisites with the wisdom of renunciation: while using them, maintaining a clear attitude that is not bound or entangled, allowing the requisites to become aids to practice and to life, rather than chains that fetter the mind.  

IV. Causes of the Decline of a Family Estate and the Impermanence of Wealth  

IV.1 Eight Causes for the Decline and Loss of a Family Estate  

The continuation of a family estate and wealth is not a matter of course; it too can decline and be lost due to various internal and external factors. With regard to external disasters and mismanagement, the decline and loss of a family estate can be summarized into eight main causes.  

First, sometimes wealth is heavily taxed or forcibly confiscated by the king, greatly reducing the family’s property. Second, plunder by thieves is also a major cause: when the family estate becomes an object of theft and robbery, wealth accumulated over many years may be lost overnight. Third, destruction by fire can turn property into ashes, and fourth, flooding can submerge fields, houses, and goods, resulting in irretrievable losses.  

Apart from these calamities, if a person lacks the ability and methods to accumulate and preserve wealth, and cannot properly store and manage what is obtained, this too will cause the gradual loss of wealth. If family members are lazy and abandon the family enterprise, unwilling to continue working hard to manage it, the ancestral estate will also gradually decline and be unable to continue.  

On the other hand, if someone in the family squanders wealth, indulging in pleasure and becoming a prodigal, he will rapidly exhaust the family’s savings, leading an originally affluent family estate toward ruin. Finally, all family estates and wealth are ultimately governed by impermanent change: even if there are, for the time being, no disasters and no mismanagement, they may still decline and be lost due to various unforeseeable changes, revealing the fundamental nature of family estates and property as something that cannot be permanently secured.  

Within these causes for the decline of a family estate, we can see the very situations mentioned earlier: wealth being taxed or confiscated by the king, seized by thieves, destroyed by fire, and carried off by water. These are both possible results of improper use of wealth and concrete calamities that arise from inadequate protection and mismanagement of the family estate, repeatedly reminding us from different angles of the fragility and impermanence of wealth.  

V. Nine Patterns of Seeking Wealth and Enjoying Sensual Pleasures  

V.1 Three Patterns of Seeking Wealth by Illegal and Violent Means  

In the process by which people seek wealth and enjoy sensual pleasures, nine patterns can be distinguished according to the methods of seeking wealth and the ways of later enjoyment. The first group consists of three patterns in which one uses illegal and violent means to seek wealth.  

The first, called Type One, is to acquire wealth through illegal and violent means, and, after gaining it, not to obtain happiness and joy oneself—one remains unhappy and ill at ease—while at the same time being unwilling to distribute the wealth to others and not using it for any kind of wholesome deed. Thus, in this pattern the means of acquisition are improper, the heart is not at peace, and there is also a lack of generosity and virtuous use.  

The second, called Type Two, likewise involves seeking wealth by illegal and violent means. After obtaining the wealth, however, the person feels happiness and joy, subjectively perceiving that life has become more comfortable as a result. Yet, although he is thus happy himself, he is still unwilling to distribute the wealth to others and does not use it to engage in wholesome deeds, refusing to let wealth become a tool that benefits others.  

The third, called Type Three, also involves seeking wealth through illegal and violent means, but the situation differs somewhat. After obtaining wealth, this person feels happiness and joy and gains satisfaction in his personal life; at the same time, he is willing to distribute wealth and to use it for wholesome deeds, allowing wealth to benefit others through generosity and virtuous acts. Nevertheless, although the way of enjoyment and distribution is relatively kind, the fundamental method of acquisition is still illegal and violent, and thus, taken as a whole, this pattern still carries grave faults.  

V.2 Three Patterns of Mixed Means: Legal/Illegal and Non-violent/Violent  

The second group of patterns involves seeking wealth by mixed means that combine legal and illegal, non-violent and violent methods; this group also consists of three patterns.  

The pattern called Type Four refers to a person who, in seeking wealth, simultaneously employs a mixed approach of legal and illegal, non-violent and violent means. As a result, he does obtain wealth, but he does not thereby feel happiness and joy; he is not satisfied with what he has gained, and instead remains inwardly uneasy or unhappy. At the same time, he is neither willing to distribute wealth to others nor to use it for wholesome deeds, so that the wealth, partly gained through improper means, is also not put to good use.  

The pattern called Type Five likewise involves seeking wealth through mixed means. After obtaining the wealth, the person feels happiness and joy, subjectively believing that his life has improved. However, he still does not distribute wealth to others, nor is he willing to use it to carry out wholesome deeds. Wealth thus remains merely a tool for satisfying his own enjoyment, lacking the function of benefiting others and supporting virtuous acts.  

The pattern called Type Six is also one in which wealth is acquired through a mixture of legal and illegal, non-violent and violent methods. In this case, when the wealth is obtained, the person likewise feels happiness and joy, and is also willing to further distribute wealth and engage in wholesome deeds, so that the wealth not only satisfies himself but also benefits others. Yet, because the method of acquisition still contains elements of illegality and violence, from an overall perspective there remains an aspect of impurity in the pattern.  

V.3 Three Patterns of Seeking Wealth by Legal and Non-violent Means  

The third group of patterns consists of seeking wealth by legal and non-violent means; in these cases, the way of acquisition itself is pure and proper. This group can likewise be further divided into three specific patterns.  

The pattern called Type Seven refers to a person who acquires wealth in accordance with the law and without using violence, but, after obtaining it, does not feel happiness and joy; inwardly he is neither pleased nor content with what he has. At the same time, he is unwilling to distribute wealth to others and does not use wealth as a basis for performing wholesome deeds, so that wealth becomes merely an accumulation without good use.  

The pattern called Type Eight also involves seeking wealth legally and non-violently, but the outcome differs. Such a person, after acquiring wealth, feels happiness and joy, and life thereby becomes more comfortable and happy. However, he still does not distribute wealth to others, nor does he use it to perform wholesome deeds; he remains at the level of satisfying his own enjoyment, without allowing his wealth to generate broader beneficial use.  

The pattern called Type Nine is one in which a person seeks wealth legally and non-violently, and after acquiring it, he both feels happiness and joy himself and is willing to distribute wealth and engage in wholesome deeds, allowing wealth to benefit others. More importantly, in this pattern the person can maintain an attitude of non-greed and non-delusion toward wealth: he does not create evil karma for the sake of wealth, clearly perceives its faults, is not deceived by it, and, while using it, is able to gain from it the essential meaning of renunciation.  

In other words, he both seeks wealth by proper means and enjoys it happily while extensively performing wholesome deeds; at the same time, his mental attitude is detached and non-clinging, clearly understanding the limitations and dangers of wealth, so that wealth truly becomes an aid to the path.  

VI. Four Major Criteria for Evaluating the Pursuit and Enjoyment of Wealth  

VI.1 The Content of the Four Major Evaluation Criteria  

To evaluate whether a person’s pursuit of wealth and enjoyment of sensual pleasures is worthy of praise or should be blamed, one can observe according to four main criteria.  

The first criterion is the “method of seeking wealth,” that is, whether he “seeks wealth in accordance with the law and without violence,” or “by illegal and violent means.” This concerns whether the source of wealth is pure and proper, and whether it harms others or violates legal and moral norms.  

The second criterion is “personal enjoyment,” meaning whether, after obtaining wealth, the person truly attains “happiness and joy.” If wealth is plentiful yet causes one to remain constantly uneasy and full of afflictions, this indicates that the way of seeking and enjoying wealth is unhealthy.  

The third criterion is “distribution of wealth,” that is, whether the person is willing to “distribute and use it for wholesome deeds,” letting wealth become a tool for benefiting others through generosity, support, or other virtuous actions.  

The fourth criterion is “mental attachment,” meaning whether the person can be “free of greed and clinging, not deluded, not led into wrongdoing, able to see faults, and able to gain the essential meaning of renunciation” with respect to wealth. If, while enjoying wealth, one can remain non-attached and undeluded, not committing evil deeds for the sake of wealth, and can see its faults and thereby gain the essential meaning of renunciation, then one’s pursuit and enjoyment of wealth is not merely worldly pleasure, but is grounded in pure wisdom.  

VI.2 Basic Principles of Good and Evil, Praise and Blame  

Based on the four criteria above, we can further define which behaviors should be regarded as good and worthy of praise, and which should be considered evil and subject to blame.  

In terms of the method of seeking wealth, if one “seeks wealth in accordance with the law and without violence,” such a way is considered wholesome and should be praised and affirmed. Conversely, if one “seeks wealth by illegal and violent means,” this belongs to unwholesome conduct and should be criticized and condemned.  

Regarding personal enjoyment, if, after obtaining wealth, one truly gains “happiness and joy” and is not tormented by afflictions and suffering, this can be regarded as wholesome and should be praised. If one “does not gain happiness or joy,” and even as wealth increases one’s mind remains unhappy and unpeaceful, this is an unwholesome state and should be blamed.  

As for distribution of wealth, if one “distributes it and uses it for wholesome deeds,” allowing wealth to benefit others and promote all kinds of good actions, this mode of use is considered wholesome and should be praised. If one “does not distribute it and does not use it for wholesome deeds,” knowing only how to enjoy it alone and refusing to benefit others, this is considered unwholesome and should be blamed.  

With respect to mental attachment, if one can, toward wealth, be “free of greed and clinging, not deluded, not led into wrongdoing, able to see faults, and able to gain the essential meaning of renunciation,” neither bound by wealth nor deceived by it, seeing its faults and thereby gaining the meaning of renunciation, such an attitude is regarded as wholesome and should be praised. By contrast, if one “is greedy and clinging, deluded, led into wrongdoing, unable to see faults, and unable to gain the essential meaning of renunciation,” clinging to wealth, indulging in it, creating evil karma for its sake, failing to see its faults, and unable to obtain the meaning of renunciation from it, this belongs to unwholesome conduct and should be blamed.  

VI.3 Combinations of Criteria in Concrete Situations  

VI.3.1 Situations and Evaluations with Three Negative and One Positive Factor  

In concrete situations, different combinations of the four criteria give rise to different evaluations. One situation is that of a person who seeks wealth “in accordance with the law and without violence”; in terms of method, this is pure. However, after obtaining wealth, he does not feel happiness and joy, remaining inwardly dissatisfied or uneasy—this is negative on the level of personal enjoyment. At the same time, he is unwilling to distribute wealth to others and does not use it to perform wholesome deeds—this is also unwholesome in terms of distribution.  

Furthermore, in his mental attitude he clings to and is deluded by wealth, creating evil karma for its sake, failing to see its faults and unable to gain from it the essential meaning of renunciation. In such a situation, the method of seeking wealth provides one reason for praise, but in the three aspects of personal enjoyment, distribution, and mental attitude there are faults; thus this is considered a combination of “one reason for praise and three reasons for blame,” that is, three negative and one positive factor.  

VI.3.2 Two Situations with Two Negative and Two Positive Factors  

There are other situations that present a mixed state of two negative and two positive factors.  

The first such situation is that of a person who seeks wealth in accordance with the law and without violence; the method itself is proper. After gaining wealth, he can also feel happiness and joy; his mind thereby attains satisfaction and comfort. These two aspects—method of seeking wealth and personal enjoyment—are both wholesome and should be praised.  

However, he is still unwilling to distribute wealth to others and does not use it to perform wholesome deeds; in terms of distribution, he appears self-centered and narrow. At the same time, in his mental attitude he continues to be greedy and deluded with regard to wealth, may fall into wrongdoing because of it, does not see its faults, and cannot obtain from it the meaning of renunciation. In this situation, there are two reasons for praise (method and personal enjoyment), but also two reasons for blame (distribution and mental attitude), forming a combination of two negative and two positive factors.  

The second situation is also one of two negative and two positive factors, but the method of seeking wealth is more complex. This person uses mixed means to seek wealth, that is, there is a part that “accords with the law and is non-violent,” and another part that is “illegal and violent.” When the wealth is obtained, he feels happiness and joy, believing that his life has become more comfortable.  

From this perspective, the portion of his conduct that “seeks wealth in accordance with the law and without violence,” together with his personal enjoyment, still provides two reasons for praise. However, on the other hand, because he also “seeks wealth by illegal and violent means,” this portion of his conduct belongs to evil and should be blamed. At the same time, although he enjoys wealth, he does not distribute it to others and does not use it to perform wholesome deeds; with respect to distribution, he should also be blamed.  

As for the specific state of his mental attachment, in this situation the fourth criterion is not especially emphasized; thus the key point here is: the lawful, non-violent part of seeking wealth and the personal enjoyment provide two reasons for praise, while the illegal, violent part of seeking wealth and the refusal to distribute wealth or do wholesome deeds provide two reasons for blame, so that overall the pattern likewise displays a configuration of two negative and two positive factors.  

VI.3.3 Situations and Evaluations with One Negative and Three Positive Factors  

Another situation presents a combination of one negative and three positive factors. This person also uses mixed methods to seek wealth, containing both “in accordance with the law and without violence” and “illegal and violent” approaches. After obtaining wealth, he can feel happiness and joy; thus, in terms of personal enjoyment, this is wholesome.  

At the same time, he is willing to distribute wealth to others and to use it to perform wholesome deeds, so that what he gains does not stop at his own enjoyment but can broadly benefit others. Furthermore, the portion of his conduct that seeks wealth “in accordance with the law and without violence” can also be regarded as commendable.  

In such an overall situation, there are three aspects worthy of praise: first, the lawful and non-violent portion of the method of seeking wealth; second, the happiness and joy in personal enjoyment; and third, the distribution of wealth and the practice of wholesome deeds.  

However, because in the process of seeking wealth he still, at the same time, “seeks wealth by illegal and violent means,” this part of his conduct in terms of method is unwholesome, and thus there remains one reason that must be blamed. In other words, this situation is a combination of one negative and three positive factors: in the lawful, non-violent seeking of wealth, in personal enjoyment, and in distribution and virtuous use of wealth he is worthy of praise, but in the aspect of seeking wealth by illegal and violent means he is considered blameworthy.  

VI.3.4 The Perfect Situation in Which All Four Positive Factors Are Present  

Finally, there is a situation in which all four criteria are completely fulfilled and beyond reproach. In this case, a person seeks wealth entirely “in accordance with the law and without violence”: the method of seeking wealth is upright and pure, does not harm others, and does not violate law or morality. After obtaining wealth, he truly gains happiness and joy; life is secure due to properly obtained wealth, and his mind feels comfort and satisfaction.  

In his use of wealth, he is willing to distribute what he has gained to others and actively uses wealth to perform wholesome deeds, allowing it to become a tool that benefits living beings, rather than only something for his own enjoyment.  

Even more importantly, in his mental attitude he can maintain toward wealth an approach of “no greed or clinging, no delusion, no falling into wrongdoing, being able to see faults, and gaining the essential meaning of renunciation.” That is, he does not blindly crave wealth or allow himself to be deluded by it; he does not create evil karma because of guarding or seeking wealth. He clearly sees the faults and limitations of wealth, understands that it is, in the end, an impermanent external possession that will scatter and cannot be relied upon as an ultimate support; at the same time, he can, through the very process of facing and using wealth, gain the essential meaning of letting go of worldly attachment.  

In such a situation, the method of seeking wealth is pure, personal enjoyment is happy, distribution of wealth widely supports wholesome deeds, and the mental attitude is non-attached and wise. All four reasons are sufficient for praise; thus this is regarded as a completely wholesome and perfect model for the pursuit and enjoyment of wealth.  

Integrating the various patterns and evaluations above, we can see that wealth itself is both impermanent and easily dispersed: it may become the root of actions leading to ruin, yet, under the combined guidance of correct acquisition, good use, and an attitude of renunciation, it can be transformed into an aid to merit and wisdom. The key does not lie merely in whether one possesses wealth, but in how one acquires it, how one uses it, and with what attitude one faces it.
