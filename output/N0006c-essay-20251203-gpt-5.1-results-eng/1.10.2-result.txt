<title> The True Realm of Liberation and Nibbana and the Direction of Practice </title>
<article>
I. The True Face of Worldly Sensual Pleasure and the Noble Dhamma  
Worldly sensual pleasures are in themselves full of unease and suffering. Even when they appear sweet and delightful, they are inwardly mixed with anxiety and affliction, and cannot bring truly lasting security. In contrast, the noble Dhamma is realistic and directly verifiable; it is not abstract talk, but a law that can be personally confirmed in one’s own body and mind through actual experience. By practicing in accordance with this noble Dhamma, one is gradually guided toward Nibbana, the final liberation.

Yet there are various non-Buddhist doctrines that lead practice in the wrong direction. They teach people to pursue heavenly enjoyments, to regard pleasures on the material plane as the ultimate goal, yet are unable to guide beings beyond their present condition, and therefore cannot bring about true liberation. By contrast, what the noble Dhamma reveals is a realistic path that abandons craving and bondage, inclines toward renunciation and toward Nibbana.

II. The Roots of Bondage and the Realm Transcended by the Noble Ones  
Beings are bound to the round of birth and death by sensual desire, ill will, and ignorance, and may even fall into hell and other states of intense suffering. Noble Ones completely transcend these bonds, and also transcend hell and all realms of suffering, no longer dragged or threatened by them. They have utterly eradicated all defilements and attained supreme liberation, no longer shaken by worldly sensuality, entirely beyond the domain of Māra.

In such a liberated state, fear of death is also overcome. The Noble Ones have mastered and surmounted their fear of death and destroyed all the threats that death brings, thereby attaining a state that is beyond birth and death, free and unobstructed. This transcendence is not only a psychological composure; it is the factual ending of the root of birth and death, so that the round of rebirth no longer continues.

Final liberation also means that the darkness of ignorance is dispelled. When all delusion and darkness are completely destroyed, the mind reaches the state of ultimate purity and liberation, with no stain or obstruction remaining. This realm is peaceful and unmoving, secure and unshakable, a place where ordinary beings cannot reach and the power of Māra cannot touch.

III. The Nature and Characteristics of Nibbana and Liberation  
In terms of the essence of the Dhamma, the realized truth is a law that arises dependent on conditions: all phenomena arise in dependence upon conditions, and when conditions change, all fabrications come to cessation. True liberation is precisely the cessation of all fabrications, the relinquishing of all clinging, the ending and abandoning of craving and lust, entering quiescence and arriving at Nibbana.

In the state of Nibbana, in-breaths and out-breaths cease; the mind abides in stillness and concentration, no longer stained by sensual defilements, and therefore attains ultimate peace. At that time the heart no longer clings to any realm or object; its capacity is vast and free. Like a lamp flame that has gone out and does not flare up again, this is not annihilation, but complete peace that is free from all grasping and bondage.

Nibbana itself is the ultimate state of liberation and the supreme teaching that can free from all fetters and afflictions. Compared with this, the love between parents and children or between husband and wife may feel endearing and warm, yet such affection cannot truly free one from suffering, and its value is still far inferior to the pursuit of liberation in Nibbana. Nibbana is also the manifestation of “cessation”: wherever defilements and suffering cease, that is Nibbana, and this realm can be directly known and realized through wisdom and clear seeing.

Nibbana is defined as the complete destruction of sensual desire, ill will, and delusion; Nibbana is precisely the state in which sensual desire, ill will, and delusion are wholly destroyed. The unconditioned state is likewise defined as the complete destruction of sensual desire, ill will, and delusion. The taming and destruction of greed, hatred, and delusion is Nibbana, and is also called “the Deathless.” Thus, “the Deathless” and “Nibbana” are different names for the same ultimate realm.

This unconditioned, undecaying state has many synonyms: it is called the ultimate, the taintless, the true reality, the further shore, the skilful, the extremely hard to see, the ageless, the firm, the illuminative, the incomparable, the free from proliferation, the peaceful, the ambrosia, the supremely sublime, the secure, the safe, the end of craving, the inconceivable, the rare, the calamity-free, the calamity-free Dhamma, Nibbana, the harmless, the freedom from sensual desire, the pure, the liberation, the non-abiding, the lamp, the cave, the shelter, the refuge, and the further shore. All these names point to the same reality: a state of complete freedom from lust, utterly pure and taintless, secure and unmoving—the liberated realm that is the final place of reliance and refuge.

IV. The Goal of Liberation and the Overall Direction of Practice  
A practitioner who purifies the mind in search of liberation must follow the practice outlined above, in order to find the exit to liberation. The concrete goal of liberation is to reach a peaceful state free from sorrow and distress, to transcend the round of rebirth and no longer be reborn. The fruit of practice is the cessation of all suffering and affliction and the attainment of true happiness, with wisdom purified and all bondage’s knots untied.

On this path, in order to accomplish the still incomplete aggregate of liberation, the practitioner should dwell with reverence for the true Dhamma; and in order to accomplish the still incomplete aggregate of knowledge-and-vision-of-liberation, they should likewise dwell revering the true Dhamma, so that both the supports for liberation and the wisdom of liberation are fulfilled. The accomplishment of the aggregate of liberation and the aggregate of knowledge-and-vision-of-liberation marks the maturity of body and mind both in direct realization and in understanding.

Viewed as a whole, the ultimate goal of the training system is to attain the perfect state of “knowledge-and-liberation,” in which wisdom and liberation are both fully complete. When practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, practitioners do so in order to ultimately reach the Deathless, to move toward the Deathless, and to completely consummate the Deathless; they also cultivate it in order to move toward Nibbana, incline toward Nibbana, and draw near to Nibbana. The purpose of cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path is to fully realize and approach the Deathless and to fully realize and approach Nibbana.

Among the fruits of cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path, the core is the direct realization of Nibbana: grounded in right view, one correctly cultivates the noble path, dispels ignorance, and gives rise to wisdom, and here and now realizes the realm of Nibbana. Among the four kinds of Dhamma that are to be understood and practiced, one type must be directly realized personally: that is “knowledge and liberation.” The ultimate direction of practice is to move toward Nibbana, incline toward Nibbana, draw near to Nibbana, and at the same time to ultimately realize, approach, and consummate the Deathless. Thus, the point of the Noble Eightfold Path and its final orientation is to tame and utterly end sensual craving, ill will, and delusion, thereby fully realizing the Deathless and moving toward, inclining toward, and entering into Nibbana.

In all practice, mindfulness should take liberation as the final destination, and this liberation clearly points to the realm of Nibbana. Nibbana is the ultimate goal and perfect endpoint of practice; the entire holy life leads directly to Nibbana. The cultivation of the three roots is clearly directed toward the complete cessation of birth, aging, and death; all efforts ultimately converge upon and draw near to Nibbana, so that, step by step in the course of actual practice, the practitioner moves toward Nibbana. As long as practice is pursued correctly, one will eventually reach the further shore of the realm of death—that is, the state that transcends birth and death.

V. The Five Aggregates, the Conditioned, and the Substance of the Truth of Cessation  
As to the substance of the Truth of Cessation, one must correctly contemplate the nature of the five aggregates. Form is impermanent, conditioned, arisen from dependent origination; therefore it is subject to ending, to breaking up, to separation, to cessation. Feeling is impermanent, conditioned, arisen from dependent origination, and likewise is subject to ending, to breaking up, to separation, to cessation. Perception is impermanent, conditioned, arisen from dependent origination, and is also a phenomenon that ends, breaks up, separates, and ceases. Formations are impermanent, conditioned, arisen from dependent origination, and thus inevitably are phenomena that end, break up, separate, and cease. Consciousness is also impermanent, conditioned, arisen from dependent origination, and is a phenomenon that ends, breaks up, separates, and ceases. The five aggregates are all subject to change and destruction; none of the aggregates can serve as a basis for an eternal self.

From this it is known that the fading out, subsiding, and vanishing of the five aggregates is the undecaying, unperishing Dhamma—that is, the unconditioned. When all confused views, heterodox doctrines, distorted understandings, and inner agitation are entirely abandoned, and all grasping is cut off at the root like a palmyra tree whose pith has been severed and will never grow again, this is the complete cessation of the aggregate of suffering and the state of final liberation. From another angle, the ultimate destiny of the five aggregates is cessation: form is a phenomenon that ceases; feeling is a phenomenon that ceases; perception is a phenomenon that ceases; formations are phenomena that cease; consciousness is a phenomenon that ceases. Only when these phenomena of cessation are clearly seen as they truly are and let go of, is it possible genuinely to enter the unconditioned, undecaying realm.

VI. Right View and Contemplation: From Disenchantment to Liberation of Mind  
Through correct observation, practitioners cultivate right view, which then triggers a series of inner transformations. When one regards phenomena with right contemplation, a sense of disenchantment toward the observed objects first arises. Because of disenchantment, joy and craving for the objects are eliminated together. When joy and craving are completely removed, this is called liberation of mind, a wholesome liberation.

In practice, when the practitioner develops disenchantment toward all phenomena, that disenchantment leads to dispassion. Because disenchantment gives rise to dispassion, the mind becomes liberated. At the moment of liberation there naturally arises the wisdom, “I am liberated” or “I have attained liberation,” and one understands that the round of rebirth has ended, the pure holy life has been fulfilled and established, what needed to be done has been done, and there will be no future existence, no future life, no continuation of this mode of existence and of future birth and death.

In the accomplishment of correct understanding, the practitioner, endowed with right view, can attain the ultimate state and be established in a realm beyond birth and death. When ignorance ceases, suffering also completely ceases. At that point there is no more fabrication, and one no longer thinks in terms of worldly things; because there is no clinging, there is no fear; because there is no fear, one can realize Nibbana for oneself, clearly knowing: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.”

In the various contemplations, practitioners recognize the six sense bases and their six objects as impermanent, suffering, and subject to decay, and thereby develop a sense of revulsion toward them. To the point that, regarding this conscious body and all external forms, one no longer harbors any underlying conceit of “I” or “mine,” and clearly sees the five aggregates as impermanent, suffering, and changing, no longer regarding them as “I” or “mine.” From revulsion comes dispassion, and from dispassion comes liberation; at liberation the mind no longer depends on any object, no longer grasps, and reaches a state of liberation that no longer falls into future existence.

In contemplating impermanence, the practitioner, out of revulsion, withdraws from desire; through withdrawing from desire, one gains liberation. Upon gaining liberation, the wisdom “I am liberated” arises, and one realizes that life has ended, the pure holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, and there will be no continuation of this mode of existence. Through such contemplation, ignorance disappears and light arises; the mind clings to no phenomena, is liberated from all taints, and knows: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no returning to any state of being.”

At the same time, contemplation of feelings is also an important part of liberation. When a bhikkhu’s feelings all cease, two results are obtained: first, he no longer has craving like hunger and thirst; second, he enters into the state of complete stillness. Even when he still experiences pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings, if he understands that they are all impermanent, and does not cling to or delight in them, he can also obtain liberation through these feelings. At the time when the body breaks up and this life ends, if one understands at that point that no feeling is to be rejoiced in, one can attain the state of ultimate coolness.

VII. The Realization of Liberation and the Knowledge “Birth is Ended”  
When practice has matured, a series of clear signs of liberation appear. “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established or completed, the pure training has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done; there is no further existence, no more taking up of another existence, no more future life, no further round of birth and death”—these are the contents that a liberated person directly and truly knows. This cognition is called “the wisdom of liberation” or the knowledge “I am liberated”; it is the wisdom that naturally arises at the moment of liberation.

At different stages of practice, this declaration of self-knowledge appears repeatedly in various formulations. Some say, “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there is no further rebirth.” Some say, “I know for myself that I will not take up another existence; I clearly see that my practice is complete, confirm that the holy life has been fully established, and clearly know that the fetters of life have been completely cut off.” Others say, “The round of rebirth has come to complete cessation; the pure training has been firmly established; what had to be done has been fulfilled; there will be no future round of birth and death.” All these statements point to the same fact: the causes of the round have been destroyed, and the process of death and rebirth no longer continues.

When consciousness has nowhere to stand, does not proliferate, and does not continue to flow, liberation is attained. Because of liberation, one abides; because of abiding, one is content; because of contentment, there is no fear; because of the absence of fear, one personally realizes Nibbana and clearly knows: “Life has come to its conclusion; the pure holy life has been established; what had to be done has been done; there is no continuation of existence.” In many teachings, this sequence appears repeatedly: through overcoming defilements one gains liberation; through liberation one abides; through abiding one is content; through contentment one has no fear; through being fearless one realizes Nibbana and clearly knows: “Life has been fulfilled; the pure training has been established; what had to be done has been done; there will be no future round of birth and death.”

After realizing the Four Noble Truths, wisdom and understanding arise, the liberation of mind becomes stable and unshakable; this is called “the last birth,” after which there is no further existence. Likewise, having accomplished right view, the practitioner can reach the ultimate state and be established beyond birth and death. For the liberated person, when examining his own condition, there is no longer any need for external confirmation or definition, because the clear self-knowledge—“Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being”—is already fully established.

VIII. The Inner Stillness and Abiding of the Liberated One  
The inner signs of a liberated person are very evident. The fire of defilements has been completely extinguished; within, there is genuine lightness and stillness; all pain and disturbance have been subdued. At that time there is no more clinging to any object of craving; attachment to all things is cut off; the heart is cool and needs no support.

In the liberated state, one no longer gives rise to grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, or distress because of the changes of the world; the mind is steady and lucid, maintaining an even contemplation toward all change. Such a practitioner, even in the face of any situation, is no longer shaken. When grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and distress have been cut off, there is no more fear; because there is no fear, one can dwell at ease. A practitioner who can dwell at ease in this way is called “a bhikkhu who dwells happily,” one who is heading toward Nibbana.

Nibbana itself is the further shore that transcends all terror and attains ultimate security; it is the secure place at the world’s end. One is described as being able to cross this great ocean of the six sense faculties—full of waves, whirlpools, and demons and ogres—and thus is said to have “reached the further shore and now stands secure on dry land.” This means that he has crossed the hard-to-cross sea of waves, attained the highest wisdom, established a pure holy life, and reached the limit of the world.

For the solitary practitioner, who lives alone in practice, he abandons craving, is not stained by anything, transcends all bonds, is endowed with wisdom, has brought sensual craving to complete extinction, and has attained full liberation. When all feelings have ceased, he no longer has craving like hunger and thirst, and naturally enters into the state of complete stillness; inwardly he always abides in security and coolness.

IX. The Fruits of Non‑Clinging, Non‑Proliferation, and Freedom from Craving  
The key to the path of liberation lies in thorough letting go and non-clinging. Practitioners must abandon all the components that make up perception and experience, in order truly to attain liberation. At the six bases of contact, they do not cling to “I” and “mine”; regarding all aggregates, elements, and sense bases, they no longer give rise to conceptual proliferation and attachment. Because they do not proliferate concepts, they do not cling to anything in the world; without clinging, there is no longing, and without longing they can enter Nibbana alone.

The core of the practice of non-proliferation lies in this: toward any thing in the world, one has no clinging; due to the absence of clinging there is no longing; because there is no longing, one can personally realize Nibbana alone. Such a practitioner clearly knows for himself: “Birth is ended, the pure holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further round of rebirth.” Likewise, when he no longer proliferates concepts or clings to any aggregate, element, or sense base, then because he does not proliferate concepts, he does not cling to anything in the world; without clinging there is no longing; without longing he can enter Nibbana alone and clearly knows: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.”

In this direction of practice, the core task of liberation is to completely cut off inner craving, to totally destroy all fetters, and to fully uproot all conceit. Practitioners should take non-clinging and a state free from the “arrow” (of defilement) as their goal. When, because there are no such proliferating thoughts, one does not cling to anything in the world, then due to non-clinging there is no longing, and due to the absence of longing the mind attains liberation in Nibbana. At that point one clearly knows: “The round of rebirth is ended, the pure holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further round of birth.”

In the fruits of practice based on non-clinging, because there is no longing, one can personally realize Nibbana alone and clearly knows: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.” This is the stable abiding that is unmoving and free from the arrow. For the bhikkhu who has attained liberation through the ending of craving, he has transcended all attachment and conceptual distinctions, and thus there is no longer any need to define or explain questions about his mode of existence.

The path of liberation at the same time emphasizes that, at the six bases of contact, one does not cling to “I” and “mine”; without clinging, there is no longing; without longing, one can enter Nibbana alone. At that point one knows that birth is ended, the pure holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, and there will be no future rebirth. If the mind, regarding the six sense-objects, does not delight, does not praise, and does not cling, then it does not depend on them and does not grasp them, and can enter Nibbana. Conversely, if the mind delights in, praises, and clings to the six sense-objects, it then depends on and grasps them, and thus cannot enter Nibbana.

X. Crossing the Ocean of Birth and Death: The Further Shore, the Deathless, and Refuge  
By completely abandoning sensual desire, ill will, and ignorance, one can cross the ocean of birth and death. The state of liberation is to transcend the round of rebirth, give up all forms of existence, cut off the root of renewed birth, and enter the peaceful state in which suffering has ceased. In this way, one escapes the bondage of birth and death and is no longer ruled by death. When the practice is fulfilled, one reaches the further shore of the realm of death—that is, truly transcends birth and death.

Nibbana is described as the further shore that transcends all terror and attains ultimate security. It is the place of reaching the further shore, obtaining shelter, cave, lamp, and refuge. It is like the true message delivered by a messenger, a final Dhamma that is real and not deceptive. When practitioners completely abandon all obstacles and bonds, they have fulfilled the conditions for liberation and can move toward Nibbana. In practice, they do not cling to this shore or the further shore, do not sink into the stream of consciousness, are not bound or grasped by any internal or external factor, and keep the mind pure and uncorrupted. In this way they naturally move toward Nibbana, because right view itself is the path that leads to Nibbana.

In cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path and the various contemplations, practitioners constantly move toward the Deathless, progressing toward the realm beyond birth and death; at the same time they incline toward Nibbana, allowing the heart to continuously turn toward peaceful liberation. The core goal of all practice is to make the mind take liberation as its final destination, so that all wholesome efforts point toward the realm of Nibbana.

XI. Nibbana as “Knowledge-and-Liberation” and Ultimate Accomplishment  
When, with right wisdom, one sees that all five aggregates are not-self and not-mine, one develops revulsion toward the five aggregates; from revulsion comes dispassion; from dispassion comes liberation. At liberation there arises the knowledge “I am liberated,” and one realizes: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.” This twofold achievement of knowledge and liberation is the final goal and core fruit of the entire training system; it is the perfect state of “knowledge-and-liberation.”

When wisdom and right understanding arise, and the mind is liberated and no longer moves, this marks the completion of the last life, with no further existence to follow. At this time, genuine wisdom and right view arise, bringing about total liberation of the heart and attaining the state of the final life, with no future round of rebirth. When practice is fulfilled, one reaches the further shore of the realm of death, transcending birth and death, and all practice ultimately comes to rest in this supremely pure Nibbana.
