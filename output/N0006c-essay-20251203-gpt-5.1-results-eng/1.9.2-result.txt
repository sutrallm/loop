I. Faith and the Stability of Life  

I.1 Present-Life and Future-Life Benefits of Faith  

One who possesses right faith will, in this very life, gain good reputation and praise, becoming a person respected by others; and at the time of death, he will be reborn in good destinations such as the heavenly worlds. When a person takes faith as his foundation and establishes his mind in the Three Jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, then in this life he will be praised for his virtue, and in future lives he will, on the strength of this pure confidence, be reborn in heavenly realms, continuing a life of happiness and light.

Likewise, when a practitioner reflects that in body, speech, and mind he has observed the precepts and does not harm living beings, he can be certain that in this life he will have happiness and in future lives also will have happiness, and at death will be reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world. This honest self-examination and firm assurance regarding one’s own virtuous conduct is also a concrete way in which faith brings stability and safety in both this life and the next.

I.2 Sources of Support in Life and the Merit That Is One’s Provision  

On the journey of life, people have different kinds of supports and pillars. For a traveler going far, the caravan leader is a friend and support on the road; in a family, the mother is the friend and support of the household, providing warmth and care. When events occur and circumstances change, a true friend will stand up and give practical help; children are the support and strength of a person’s life, enabling one to feel that there is something to rely on in the latter part of life. A wife is the closest companion, one with whom one lives in mutual dependence in daily life.

However, from a longer-term perspective, what a person can truly rely on in the future, after death and through many lives, is the merit he has accumulated. The wholesome deeds and pure merit that one gathers within oneself are the most reliable support and provision for the future. Therefore, apart from all worldly friends and companions, the wholesome actions that one personally cultivates are especially important, for they determine the direction and security of one’s future rebirths.

Taking refuge is also an essential aspect of the support of life. Taking refuge in the Buddha leads the practitioner toward liberation, for the Buddha, out of compassion, pities the world and guides beings to freedom from suffering and attainment of happiness. Taking refuge in the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha breaks through various internal and external obstacles, enabling the practitioner to be far removed from evil conditions and obstructive forces, and to be reborn in places of happiness. For those who aspire to renunciation, going forth in the presence of the Blessed One and undertaking the full monastic precepts, placing one’s entire life in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, is a concrete practice of making monastic life and the Vinaya the fundamental supports.

On the other hand, those who undertake the ascetic practices (dhutaṅga), in order to cut off negligence and develop the mind of renunciation, adopt a simple and austere way of life as their path of practice. Such practice not only brings long-term benefit and happiness to oneself, but also brings the same benefit and happiness to those who follow later, becoming an example and source of support for future disciples. This too is a concrete way of taking one’s own merit as one’s support for the future.

I.3 The Protective Power of Refuge and the Principle of Not Belittling  

Within the bright guidance of practice, taking refuge has a special protecting power. Taking refuge in the Buddha leads toward final liberation; the Buddha, out of compassion, protects and cares for beings in the world, enabling deluded beings to have a place to which they can return. When beings sincerely take refuge, that refuge can dispel all kinds of obstacles—whether inner defilements or external adverse conditions. All of these can be diminished and driven back through the power of taking refuge. Ultimately, taking refuge guides practitioners to rebirth in a place of happiness, far from bad destinations, leading to good destinations and heavenly worlds.

At the same time, there are certain things that, even when they are still young, small, or at an initial stage, must never be despised for that reason. Although the specific items are not listed one by one here, the principle is to remind people: when something is in its budding stage, its potential and future results must not be underestimated. If one gives rise to a mind of contempt because something is young or just beginning, one is likely to commit unwholesome actions and faults. This attitude of not belittling accords with respect for wholesome qualities and for faith, and is an important principle in protecting one’s own merit and good fortune.

I.4 Rebirth in Heavenly Good Destinations and the Superior Fruits of Heaven  

There are fundamental principles governing rebirth in good destinations and heavenly realms. When beings take refuge in the Buddha, in the Dhamma, and in the Saṅgha—that is, take refuge in the Three Jewels—then after death they can be led to rebirth in a good destination, a heavenly world. Moreover, if they possess unshakable confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, this firm and doubt-free faith further strengthens the causes and conditions for rebirth in heavenly good destinations.

Unshakable confidence in the Buddha means the conviction that the Blessed One is worthy of offerings (arahant), a rightly and fully enlightened Buddha (sammā-sambuddha), perfect in true knowledge and conduct, the accomplished one, the well-gone one, knower of the worlds, the incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the enlightened and blessed one, honored by the world and worthy of offerings.

Unshakable confidence in the Dhamma means the conviction that the True Dhamma well-proclaimed by the Blessed One is well-expounded, well-expounded and complete; that it bears fruit here and now; that it can be realized in this very life or in the future; that it is visible here and now, directly visible, to be seen; that it is immediate and effective, not delayed, not dependent on time, not waiting for some particular season to appear; that this Dhamma invites all to come and see—it is to be seen, to be come and seen, to be personally verified, inviting one to come and see; that it leads to Nibbāna, to peace and awakening, guiding practitioners onward on the right path; that it is a Dhamma leading to Nibbāna and guiding; and that it is a truth to be known individually by the wise, each wise person should know for himself, can realize personally and know each aspect inwardly.

Unshakable confidence in the Saṅgha means the conviction that the Blessed One’s community of disciple monks and hearers is practising well, practising the right way, practising the path rightly, practising properly and wisely; that they are practising well, straightforwardly, rightly, properly, decorously; that they practise beautifully, uprightly, in accordance with reason, harmoniously; that they practise in accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with reason, harmoniously. This Saṅgha is composed of the Blessed One’s noble disciples, the four pairs, the eight types of noble persons; a community of noble ones who live in accordance with the teaching and follow the right path; the Blessed One’s community of hearers and noble Saṅgha; they are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respectful salutation, worthy of invitations, greatly worthy of invitations, worthy of joined palms; they are the unsurpassed field of merit for the world, the supreme field of merit worthy of honor, respect, offerings, and joined-palm homage.

Through such unshakable confidence in the Three Jewels and the power of taking refuge in them, beings at death can be reborn in good destinations, heavenly worlds. Those who, by this principle, are reborn in heaven surpass other devas in ten respects: they excel in the length of their heavenly lifespan, in the brightness and beauty of their heavenly color, in the happiness they enjoy in heaven, in the praise they receive in heaven, and in the authority and power they obtain in heaven. Further, beyond outer brightness they excel in their heavenly appearance and complexion; in heavenly sounds, the sounds they hear are purer and more pleasant; in heavenly scents, the fragrances they smell are purer and more delightful; in heavenly tastes, the flavors they taste are more agreeable; and in heavenly tangibles, the bodily sensations they experience are more subtle and gentle. Thus it is evident that taking refuge and possessing firm confidence not only protects beings from downfall, but also leads to especially excellent heavenly fruits.

II. Purity, Self-Reliance, and Places of Practice  

II.1 The True Source of Purity and Common Misunderstandings  

When we speak of “purity,” it is not something to be sought in external forms. Purity does not come from one’s caste or birth; thus one should not judge whether a person is pure or impure by his birth, but should observe his actions—whether they are wholesome or unwholesome, pure or impure. Therefore, with respect to others, one should not merely ask about their origin, but should only ask about their conduct, taking their behavior as the standard of judgment.

Similarly, genuine purity cannot be obtained through external fire sacrifices or rituals. If someone imagines that by performing fire sacrifices he can thereby attain purity, and places his hope for purity in such external rituals, this kind of outward-seeking reliance will never bring about true purity. Genuine purity does not arise from inquiring about birth or from performing fire sacrifices and such external conditions.

The true source of purity is inner wisdom, abstention from evil, a sense of shame and moral dread, and self-discipline. When a person contemplates himself with wisdom, restrains and ceases evil actions, has a sense of shame and moral conscience regarding wrongdoing, and is able to tame and discipline his own body and mind, then his inner being naturally becomes purer and purer. Such inner purity enables a person to become a noble one and to reach the noble path. In other words, a noble one is noble not because of external status or rituals, but because of the true purity that arises from inner wisdom and virtue.

II.2 The Fundamental Principles of Self-Reliance and Reliance on the Dhamma  

On the path of practice, practitioners are instructed to establish an inner refuge. To “make oneself an island” means to take oneself as one’s place of reliance and refuge, not to seek some other external support, and not to take others as one’s ultimate object of dependence. This principle of self-reliance emphasizes that a practitioner must take responsibility for his own body and mind, standing on the foundation of mindfulness and wisdom, rather than entrusting his fundamental support to external, unstable things or persons.

At the same time, a practitioner should also “make the Dhamma an island,” taking the true Dhamma as his island, place of reliance, and refuge, and not relying on other external teachings or defiled views. To “make the Dhamma an island” means to take the rightly taught Dhamma well-proclaimed by the Blessed One as the standard for measurement and practice, regarding the true Dhamma as the only reliable criterion, and not taking other defiled teachings, wrong views, or worldly standards as the ultimate refuge.

This principle of self-reliance and reliance on the Dhamma is not limited to any particular era or location, but applies in all times and places. Wherever and whenever they may be, practitioners should take themselves and the true Dhamma as their island and refuge, and not rely on others or on what is not the true Dhamma. When a practitioner truly understands self-reliance and reliance on the Dhamma, he will not lose his direction amid all kinds of external changes.

II.3 Places to Frequent and Places to Avoid: Where Practitioners Should Dwell  

In choosing places for practice, there is a basic principle: one should stay away from “non-practice-places” and dwell in “proper practice-places.” “Non-practice-places” are “the domain of others,” that is, places and spheres that a practitioner should not roam about in or become involved with. If a practitioner often wanders in such non-practice-places, this will lead to inauspicious consequences, reducing his merit. More seriously, roaming in non-practice-places allows Māra to gain an opportunity, to find a foothold to disturb and obstruct him.

By contrast, “proper practice-places” are “the domain of one’s parents,” meaning that a practitioner should dwell within his own proper, wholesome sphere of life and practice. To remain within such a domain is safe and well-guarded, like remaining within the domain of one’s parents. Dwelling in proper practice-places prevents Māra from having any opening or reason to intrude, thereby protecting one’s wholesome qualities and merit. Dwelling in proper practice-places is a safe and steady way of practice, so that the practitioner will not lose mindfulness or be disturbed due to external conditions.

II.4 The Difference in Practice Between Ordinary Persons and Noble Disciples  

Among practitioners there are two fundamentally different types. One type follows “the path that leads to the accumulation of embodied existence,” that is, the path that allows the mass of suffering of this body-and-existence to gather and grow. This is the path of the uninstructed ordinary person. Such an ordinary person is “uninstructed”: he does not associate with noble ones and good spiritual friends, does not understand the teaching of the noble ones, and does not take pains to learn and practise it. Because he lacks hearing and learning, he naturally follows the path that accumulates the suffering of embodied existence, and cannot move toward liberation.

The other type follows “the path that leads to the cessation of embodied existence,” that is, the path that brings the suffering of embodied existence to an end. This is the path of the instructed noble disciple. Such disciples are “instructed”: they associate with noble ones and good spiritual friends, they understand the teaching of the noble ones, and they are diligent in learning and practising it. Precisely because they approach good spiritual friends, hear the true Dhamma, and attend to things in line with the Dhamma, the path they walk is one that leads to the cessation of the suffering of embodied existence, rather than to its continued accumulation in saṃsāra.

When such noble disciples further cultivate the five faculties that lead to peace and awakening—namely the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom—and bring them to fulfillment, then, if they have become monks with the taints destroyed (arahants), they can behold the supreme state of safety and security. Having personally seen this supreme safety, they develop the highest reverence for the Buddha and his teaching. This reverence is not merely verbal praise, but is expressed in their respect and deference toward their teacher, the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, the training rules, and meditation. Thus, between instructed noble disciples and uninstructed ordinary persons there is a fundamental difference in their association with spiritual friends, in their learning of the teaching, and in their attitude toward practice.

III. The Buddha’s Qualities, His Light, and Those Worthy of Offerings  

III.1 The Superiority and Transcendence of the Buddha’s Light  

The Buddha’s light surpasses all radiance in the world. This light is not merely light visible to the eye, but the brilliance that shines forth from the Buddha’s perfect virtues and pure reputation, and thus outshines the light of all beings in the world. The Buddha is endowed with immeasurable qualities—worthy of offerings, fully enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, the well-gone one, knower of the worlds, the incomparable leader, tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the enlightened and blessed one—and his light naturally is broader and purer than that emitted by any other being.

This light not only surpasses the brilliance of all beings, but also pervasively illuminates the entire world. Therefore the Buddha’s light has the characteristic of universally shining; it is not limited by space but can shine throughout the world, enabling those with sufficient conditions to behold the light and escape darkness. Those accomplished in true knowledge and conduct are supreme among humans and devas—“those accomplished in knowledge and conduct are supreme among humans and devas”—this points precisely to this quality: that the Buddha and other noble ones accomplished in knowledge and conduct are the most excellent among humans and heavenly beings.

III.2 The True Recipients of Offerings and the Merit of Robe-giving  

In regard to offerings, those who are truly worthy recipients are the noble ones who have completely cut off the defilements. They have fully eradicated greed, hatred, and delusion and all other defilements; their conduct is pure and without regret; in body, speech, and mind they are free of faults; therefore they have attained the status of fully accomplished noble ones. Only offerings to such truly purified noble ones who have completely cut off the defilements can accumulate genuine and ultimate merit. If the recipients of offerings are not truly pure, then the merit obtained is correspondingly limited.

Among the various forms of offerings, the giving of robes has a particular merit. The fundamental principle of robe-offering is this: the recipients of the offering are practitioners who have been liberated from all fetters; the object offered is the basic necessity of robes; and the donor is a virtuous lay follower. When such a virtuous lay follower, with a respectful mind, offers basic robes to those practitioners who have been liberated from all fetters, the merit he gains is vast and immeasurable, far exceeding ordinary acts of generosity. This is because such giving brings together a pure donor, a pure recipient, and necessary requisites, and its merit is accordingly especially profound and extensive.

III.3 The Nature of the Scent of the Noble Ones and the Deva-Kings’ Delight in It  

The scent of the noble ones is the fragrance that naturally emanates from long-term observance of precepts and the accumulation of beautiful qualities. This scent cannot be matched by external perfumes; it arises as a natural result of pure moral discipline and many wholesome virtues. When noble ones have long upheld the precepts and are endowed with fine qualities and character, their body and mind naturally emit a pure fragrance—this is what is called the scent of the noble ones.

This scent issues from the bodies of the noble ones and is carried by the wind, surpassing all ordinary worldly fragrances. It is not defiled or tainted by contact with impure things, and thus has the special quality of transcending the worldly and not being stained by what is impure. Because this scent is a symbol of moral virtue and purity, even the deva-kings cherish it greatly. They treasure the scent of the noble ones as they would treasure the flower garlands woven and worn on their heads, regarding it as a supreme jewel, never tired of it, because it is a special fragrance that represents the virtues of the noble ones.

IV. Recollecting the Three Jewels, Dispelling Fear, and Support at the Time of Death  

IV.1 The Content and Order of Recollecting the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha  

In practice, recollection of the Three Jewels has an important sequence and content. First comes recollection of the Buddha. When practitioners recollect the Buddha, they should rightly recollect the Blessed One as worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverential salutation; as a fully self-awakened Buddha; perfect in true knowledge and conduct; the well-gone one; knower of the worlds; the incomparable leader of persons to be tamed; teacher of gods and humans; the enlightened and blessed one, honored by the world.

Next comes recollection of the Dhamma. In recollecting the True Dhamma, one should reflect that this Dhamma has been well-expounded by the Blessed One, well-proclaimed and perfectly taught; that it bears fruit here and now and can produce results in this very life or in the future; that it is visible here and now, directly visible and to be seen; that it is immediate and effective, not delayed, not dependent on time, not waiting for a particular season to manifest its results; that this True Dhamma invites beings to come and see, is to be seen, come-and-see, to be personally verified, inviting one to come and see; that it leads to Nibbāna, to peace and awakening, guiding practitioners forward; that it is a Dhamma leading to Nibbāna and a guiding Dhamma; and that it is a truth to be known individually by the wise, each wise person should know for himself, can be personally realized and inwardly verified.

Then comes recollection of the Saṅgha. In recollecting the Saṅgha, one should accurately contemplate that the Blessed One’s disciple Saṅgha and community of hearers is practising well, practising the right way, practising the path rightly, practising properly and wisely; that they are practising well, straightforwardly, rightly, properly, decorously; that they are practising beautifully, uprightly, in accordance with reason, harmoniously; that they practise in accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with reason, harmoniously. This Saṅgha is composed of the Blessed One’s noble disciples, the four pairs, the eight types of noble persons—a noble community; they are a Saṅgha that practises in accordance with the teaching and follows the Blessed One’s Dhamma. They are worthy of gifts, hospitality, offerings, and reverential salutation; they are worthy of invitations, greatly worthy of invitations, worthy of joined palms; they are the unsurpassed field of merit for the world, the most excellent field of merit in the world.

In addition, when recollecting the Three Jewels, one should simultaneously possess three fundamental forms of pure faith: pure faith in the Buddha—confidence that the Buddha possesses all the above-mentioned epithets and qualities; pure faith in the Dhamma—confidence that the Dhamma is well-expounded, visible here and now, bearing fruit in this life, immediate, not delayed, timeless, inviting one to come and see, guiding, leading to Nibbāna, and that it is to be known individually by the wise, each wise person can know and personally realize and inwardly verify it; pure faith in the Saṅgha—confidence that the Saṅgha practises well, straightforwardly, in accordance with reason, harmoniously; that they are genuine practitioners, practising the right path, practising in accordance with the Dhamma; that they are the Blessed One’s disciple Saṅgha and community of hearers, the four pairs, the eight noble persons; that they are worthy of invitations, greatly worthy of invitations, worthy of offerings and joined palms, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world. To recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha in such an orderly and content-complete way is full recollection of the Three Jewels.

IV.2 The Efficacy, Root Cause, and End-of-Life Role of Recollection  

When practitioners rightly recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, a power of calm and purity arises. Specifically, recollection of the Three Jewels can remove the fear and terror that cause one’s hair to stand on end. When a practitioner thinks of the Buddha’s perfect awakening and compassion, of the reality and safety of the Dhamma, and of the purity and harmony of the Saṅgha, inner fear naturally subsides; the hair no longer stands on end and the mind no longer trembles.

The root cause of this is that the Tathāgata has completely abandoned sensual desire, ill will, and delusion, being utterly free of cowardice, trembling, and fear, and not fleeing from anything. The Buddha has attained ultimate fearlessness, far from all greed, hatred, and delusion. Because he himself feels no fear, when practitioners recollect such a fearless Enlightened One, their own hearts receive comfort and courage. Precisely because the Buddha is such a Blessed One, free from greed, hatred, and delusion, without cowardice and fear, recollecting him can dispel the fear in beings’ hearts.

At the final moment of life, such recollection is especially important. For those who are ill or dying, caregivers should remind them to recollect their firm faith in the Buddha, recollect their pure faith in the Dhamma, recollect their pure faith in the Saṅgha, and recollect the pure precepts they have observed throughout their lives. When the dying person can, at the end, recollect one by one these four inner supports—faith in the Buddha, in the Dhamma, in the Saṅgha, and his own pure moral discipline—his mind can be freed from fear and unease and instead abide in faith and purity.

At the same time, with regard to whether one fears death, there is a clear difference between ordinary persons and noble disciples. An ordinary person fears death because he has fulfilled four conditions that lead to fear: he lacks pure faith in the Buddha, lacks pure faith in the Dhamma, lacks pure faith in the Saṅgha, and his conduct is faulty, his moral discipline impure. When such a person examines himself at the approach of death and sees that he has these four deficiencies, he foresees that he will face frightening and terrifying states in future lives; therefore, he naturally feels fear at death.

A noble disciple, on the other hand, has no fear of death because he has fulfilled the opposite four factors: he has attained pure faith in the Buddha, pure faith in the Dhamma, pure faith in the Saṅgha, and pure moral discipline praised by the noble ones. When a noble disciple examines himself before death and knows that he possesses these four pure qualities, he is sure that he will be free from frightening and terrifying states in the future and will not fall into bad destinations. Because he has this assurance of a bright future, fear at the time of death is naturally eliminated.

V. The Three Jewels, Verified Faith, and the Factors of Stream-entry  

V.1 The Common Core of the Threefold Faith and the One Set of Precepts  

On the path leading to the fruit of stream-entry and liberation, the Dhamma repeatedly speaks of “threefold faith and one set of precepts,” or of “four factors,” “four factors of stream-entry,” and “four kinds of verified purity.” The common content of these four is firm, unwavering, and purified faith—verified by direct understanding—in the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha, together with pure moral discipline that the noble ones delight in and praise.

First is verified pure faith and unshakable confidence in the Buddha. The content of this faith is deep trust that the Blessed One is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverential salutation; a rightly and fully enlightened Buddha, fully and rightly awakened; a completely correct and perfectly awakened one; a noble enlightened one; accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, perfect in wisdom and conduct; the well-gone one, the well-arrived, the well-attained, the well-liberated; knower of the worlds, one who fully understands and penetrates the world and its truths; the incomparable leader, teacher, and supreme practitioner; the unsurpassed tamer of beings, who skilfully trains and tames humans, “tamer of those to be tamed”; teacher of gods and humans, guiding both devas and humans; the Buddha, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One honored by the world. To have verified purity with respect to the Buddha is to have firm, unshakable confidence in such a Blessed One possessing these ten epithets and all the above special qualities.

Second is verified pure faith and unshakable confidence in the True Dhamma. This faith is grounded in the conviction that the Dhamma proclaimed and well-expounded by the Blessed One has various superior characteristics; that it is well-proclaimed, well-proclaimed by the Blessed One; visible here and now and to be realized in this very life; immediate and effective, not delayed, not dependent on time, not waiting for some particular season; that it invites all to come and see, is to be come and seen, to be personally verified and inviting one to come and see; that it leads to Nibbāna, to peace and awakening, and is the path that guides practitioners forward; that it is a guiding Dhamma leading to Nibbāna; that it has fruits in the present and future, capable of yielding results in this life or in future lives. This Dhamma is to be known individually by the wise, to be known by each wise person; it is a truth that the wise can personally realize and inwardly verify, knowing each aspect for themselves. Thus, to have verified purity with respect to the Dhamma is to hold firm and pure confidence in such a Dhamma that is well-proclaimed, directly visible, timeless, inviting one to come and see, guiding, bearing fruit here and now, immediate and effective, leading to Nibbāna, and to be known individually by the wise.

Third is verified pure faith and unshakable confidence in the Saṅgha—the noble Saṅgha and the community of practising monks. This faith is the conviction that the Blessed One’s disciple Saṅgha and community of hearers is practising well, practising the right way, practising the true path, practising properly and wisely; that they are practising well, straightforwardly, rightly, properly, decorously; that they practise beautifully, uprightly, in accordance with reason, harmoniously; that they practise in accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with reason, harmoniously. They are composed of the Blessed One’s noble disciples, the four pairs, the eight kinds of noble persons—a noble Saṅgha and community of noble ones who practise according to the teaching and follow the Blessed One’s Dhamma. Such a Saṅgha is worthy of gifts, hospitality, offerings, and reverential salutation; worthy of invitations, greatly worthy of invitations, worthy of joined palms; the unsurpassed field of merit for the world, the most excellent field of merit. To have verified purity with respect to the Saṅgha is to have firm, pure, and unshakable confidence in such a pure, excellent Saṅgha who practise beautifully, straightforwardly, in accordance with reason, and harmoniously.

Lastly there is verified purity with respect to moral discipline and the accomplishment of precepts that the noble ones delight in—what is called “the moral discipline dear to the noble ones,” “the morality that the noble ones delight in and love.” Such moral discipline has the common features of being unbroken, unpierced, unspotted, and unblemished; not broken, not cracked, not stained, not defiled; it abandons defilements and fetters and is a morality of release, a moral discipline that leads to inner freedom and liberation. It is moral discipline that the wise delight in and praise, that the wise are pleased with and commend. One who keeps such precepts does not cling to them, does not regard them as self or grasp them with attachment. Such moral discipline supports concentration, gives rise to samādhi, and leads to meditative absorption, enabling the mind to settle in concentration. To accomplish such moral discipline is to accomplish the morality that the noble ones delight in; to have verified purity with respect to this morality is to have firm and unshakable confidence in the moral training cherished by the noble ones.

These three forms of verified purity with respect to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, together with verified purity with respect to moral discipline, are collectively called “the four kinds of verified purity,” “the four enriching kinds of merit,” “the four meritorious qualities,” “the four factors,” and “the four factors of stream-entry.” They are four qualities that noble disciples should accomplish and that lay disciples such as upāsakas should also strive to fully possess. Among the five qualities of an upāsaka, “complete in faith” means deep faith in the enlightenment attained by the Tathāgata, certainty that the Blessed One is worthy of offerings, fully enlightened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable leader, tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One—this is precisely the practice of verified purity with respect to the Buddha.

V.2 The “Mirror of the Dhamma” and the Conditions for Stream-entry  

In the Dhamma there is a teaching called “the Mirror of the Dhamma.” This teaching states that if a noble disciple accomplishes the qualities it describes, then he can, as if looking into a mirror, verify for himself that he has escaped from all bad destinations; that he will no longer fall into hell, the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts; that he has become a stream-enterer, one who is certain to attain perfect enlightenment. In other words, the Mirror of the Dhamma is like a mirror in which a practitioner can see his own mind and his future destinations.

To possess this Mirror, one must fully accomplish four conditions. The first is verified purity with respect to the Buddha: conviction that the Blessed One is worthy of offerings, fully enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable leader, tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One—worthy of offerings and a perfectly awakened one, endowed with wisdom and virtue, well-liberated and knowing the world.

The second is verified purity with respect to the Dhamma: conviction that the Dhamma proclaimed by the Blessed One and well-expounded by him is well-proclaimed, visible here and now, timeless, inviting one to come and see, leading onward, to be realized personally by the wise; that it bears fruit now, in this life, is immediate, effective, not delayed or dependent on time; that it can be personally verified, invites one to come and see, and leads to Nibbāna; that it is a Dhamma to be known individually by the wise, each wise person can know for himself and inwardly verify and realize each aspect.

The third is verified purity with respect to the Saṅgha: conviction that the Blessed One’s disciple Saṅgha and community of hearers is practising well, practising the right way, practising the true path, practising properly and wisely; that they practise well, straightforwardly, rightly, properly, decorously; that they practise beautifully, uprightly, in accordance with reason, harmoniously; that they practise in accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with reason, harmoniously. They are composed of the Blessed One’s noble disciples, the four pairs, the eight noble persons—a noble community, worthy of gifts, hospitality, offerings, and reverential salutation; worthy of invitations, greatly worthy of invitations, worthy of joined palms, the unsurpassed field of merit in the world.

The fourth is the accomplishment of the moral discipline dear to the noble ones and verified purity regarding that discipline: this moral discipline is unbroken, unpierced, unspotted, and unblemished; it abandons defilements and fetters and is moral discipline of release; it is praised and loved by the wise; it is not clung to; and it leads to concentration, gives rise to samādhi, and leads toward inner freedom.

When a noble disciple has accomplished these four kinds of verified purity—with respect to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, and the moral discipline dear to the noble ones—he has accomplished the Mirror of the Dhamma. If he now wishes to verify for himself, he can know with certainty that he has escaped all bad destinations; that he is liberated from hell, the animal realm, the realm of ghosts, and all bad and miserable destinations and states of downfall; that he has become a stream-enterer, one who is certain to attain perfect enlightenment. Thus the Mirror of the Dhamma is regarded as a key teaching that allows one to see whether one has gone beyond bad destinations and is moving toward awakening.

These four accomplishments are also called the four factors of stream-entry or the core content of the four factors of stream-entry. If a noble disciple fully accomplishes the following four principles, he can realize the fruit of stream-entry, escape inevitable downfall, be firmly established on the right path, and move toward final awakening. The four factors of stream-entry are: verified purity with respect to the Buddha—conviction that the Buddha possesses all the above-mentioned epithets and qualities, is worthy of offerings, a fully awakened one, endowed with wisdom and virtue, well-liberated, and knower of the world, the unsurpassed tamer, teacher of gods and humans, the enlightened and blessed one; verified purity with respect to the Dhamma—conviction that the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, directly visible, timeless, inviting one to come and see, leading onward, to be realized personally by the wise, bearing fruit now, in this life, immediate, effective, not delayed or time-bound, leading to Nibbāna, to be known individually by the wise; verified purity with respect to the Saṅgha—conviction that the Saṅgha practises beautifully, straightforwardly, in accordance with reason, harmoniously; that they are good practitioners, straightforward practitioners, true path-practitioners, proper practitioners; that they are composed of the four pairs, the eight noble persons; that they are worthy of invitations, greatly worthy of invitations, worthy of offerings and joined palms, the unsurpassed field of merit in the world; and the accomplishment of the moral discipline dear to the noble ones—precepts that are unbroken, unpierced, unspotted, unblemished, abandoning defilements and fetters, moral discipline of release, praised by the wise, not clung to, giving rise to samādhi and leading to meditative absorption and inner freedom.

V.3 The Merit of Firm Faith and the Fruits of Liberation  

The four kinds of verified purity—concerning the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, and moral discipline—are not only the conditions for the factors of stream-entry and for the Mirror of the Dhamma, but also the fundamental principles for transcending bad destinations. Noble disciples who possess these four kinds of verified purity can completely transcend the fear associated with all bad destinations and states of downfall. This fundamental principle applies generally to the practice of these four kinds of verified purity: even if one possesses only one of them, one has already moved in the direction of liberation; if one possesses them all, one can fully transcend the bad destinations and no longer fear falling.

In terms of concrete results, noble disciples who have accomplished these four qualities—verified purity with respect to the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, and the moral discipline dear to the noble ones—will, at death, be reborn in good destinations. Those who have gained these four accomplishments have fully transcended hell, the animal realm, the realm of ghosts, and all bad and miserable destinations and states of downfall; they are certain not to fall into bad destinations. If a person is for a long time an upāsaka, continually taking refuge in the Buddha, in the Dhamma, and in the Saṅgha, he will not be reborn in states of downfall and will not fall into hell, the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts. The merit of taking refuge in the Three Jewels is the fundamental safeguard on the path of liberation; it ensures that practitioners are free from downfall and is one of the main foundations leading to the path of liberation.

Moreover, if a noble disciple has verified purity with respect to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, then even when the four great elements of earth, water, fire, and air undergo changes and upheavals, his faith in the Three Jewels remains firm and unchanging, not shaken by them. One who possesses such verified purity cannot possibly be reborn in hell, the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts, having completely left behind the possibility of such bad destinations. Therefore, in many teachings, verified purity with respect to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha is called the “threefold verified purity,” or the three qualities, the three kinds of confidence that lead toward Nibbāna; they are key factors that direct practitioners toward Nibbāna and liberation.

When practitioners have accomplished the threefold confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and have accomplished the moral discipline dear to the noble ones, they have simultaneously accomplished the fundamental principles of threefold faith and one moral discipline. If such a person is living among humans, then devas who possess any one of these qualities themselves—whether firm faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, or pure moral discipline—will regard any human who likewise possesses that quality as certain to in future reach the heavenly realms. Thus these four qualities are not only fundamental to the path of liberation, but are also clear causes and conditions for rebirth in heavenly good destinations.

Going further, when noble disciples fully accomplish these four principles, they can realize the fruit of stream-entry, escape inevitable downfall, be firmly established on the right path, and move toward final awakening. At this point they have become stream-enterers, certain to attain perfect enlightenment. The attainment of stream-entry means that their hearts no longer fear death, for they know that they have escaped all bad destinations and that there is no longer any possibility of falling into hell, the animal realm, or the realm of ghosts. Many teachings point out that ordinary persons fear death because they lack pure faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha and because their moral discipline is impure; whereas, as mentioned above, noble disciples are unafraid of death precisely because they possess these four pure qualities.

Furthermore, the “four enriching kinds of merit” also have these four items as their content. The so-called four enriching merits or four meritorious qualities are: verified purity with respect to the Buddha—conviction that the Blessed One is worthy of offerings, fully enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable leader, tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One—worthy of offerings, fully enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, well-liberated, knower of the world, the enlightened and blessed one; verified purity with respect to the Dhamma—conviction that the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha is well-proclaimed, directly visible, timeless, inviting one to come and see, leading onward, to be realized personally by the wise, bearing fruit here and now, immediate, effective, not delayed or time-bound, leading to Nibbāna, to be known individually by the wise; verified purity with respect to the Saṅgha—conviction that the Saṅgha that practises in accordance with the Dhamma and the community of hearers are practitioners who practise beautifully, straightforwardly, in accordance with reason, harmoniously; good practitioners, straightforward practitioners, right practitioners, proper practitioners; that they are the four pairs, the eight noble persons, worthy of invitations, greatly worthy of invitations, worthy of offerings and joined palms, the unsurpassed field of merit in the world; and verified purity with respect to moral discipline and the accomplishment of the moral discipline dear to the noble ones—precepts that are unbroken, unpierced, unspotted, and unblemished, abandoning defilements and fetters, moral discipline of release, praised by the wise, not clung to, and giving rise to samādhi.

For lay upāsakas, the elements of pursuing the true path also include verified purity with respect to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and the accomplishment of moral discipline and true Dhamma dear to the noble ones. The basic conditions for accomplishment include: having definite verified faith in the Buddha, definite verified faith in the Dhamma, definite verified faith in the Saṅgha, and accomplishment of moral discipline and true Dhamma dear to the noble ones. When upāsakas complete these conditions and also possess other required qualities, they can advance steadily in practice.

In addition, when a lay follower has verified purity with respect to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and in his home has anything that can be given in generosity, he will, without discrimination, give it to those who keep precepts and are practitioners of the wholesome Dhamma, without a mind of partiality. This too is a concrete expression of verified purity as it manifests in acts of giving.

VI. Rarity and Commonness in the Cycle of Human and Heavenly Rebirth  

VI.1 The Difference Between Rare States and Common States  

In the cycle of birth and death, the states of beings can broadly be divided into rare and common categories. Rare states include beings who, at death, are able to be reborn again in the human realm—such a rebirth as a human is in itself rare; beings who are reborn in civilized countries rather than in remote borderlands among ignorant barbarians are also rare; beings who accomplish the wisdom eye of the noble ones, who open the eye of wisdom, are rarer still. Beings who abstain from drinking alcohol and do not follow the desire for intoxicants are rare; beings who are filial toward their mothers and filial toward their fathers are likewise rare. Beings who respect ascetics (samaṇas), who respect brahmins, and who respect those who are supreme in their lineage—that is, who respect those whose virtue and wisdom are most excellent—are all counted among the rare.

By contrast, common states of beings are as follows: beings who, from the human realm, are reborn in other kinds of existence are many; beings who are reborn in remote borderlands among ignorant barbarians are many; beings who follow ignorance and delusion and drift along with ignorance are many; beings who do not abstain from alcohol and still cling to the pleasures of drinking are many; beings who are not filial toward their mothers and not filial toward their fathers are many; beings who do not respect ascetics, do not respect brahmins, and do not respect those who are supreme in their lineage are also many.

Thus it can be seen that to regain a human body, to be born in a civilized place, to open the eye of wisdom, to refrain from drinking, to be filial to one’s parents, to respect ascetics and brahmins, and to respect those who are supreme in one’s lineage are all rare and hard-to-attain virtues and states. All this also reminds practitioners to cherish the wholesome conditions and human life they now possess, to make good use of this life to learn and practise the Dhamma, to establish verified faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and pure moral discipline, to stay far away from the ignorance and unwholesome conduct followed by the majority of beings, and to move toward the path of liberation and awakening.
