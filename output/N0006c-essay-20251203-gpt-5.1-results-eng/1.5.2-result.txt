<title> Universal Principles of Wisdom-Liberation and Correspondence with the Mind </title>  

<article>  
I. Liberation and the Wisdom that Transcends Discrimination  

I.1 The Mental Realm that Transcends Discrimination  
The true state of liberation first appears as a wisdom that transcends comparison and discrimination. This wisdom no longer clings to evaluations and contrasts of superior, equal, or inferior; it does not use superiority, equality, or inferiority to define oneself and others, nor is it shaken by these three kinds of differential treatment. When the mind is no longer pulled by winning and losing, high and low, and remains still and unmoved toward any distinction of better or worse, it gradually brushes away the many subtle thoughts and conceits within. In this way, all craving for name and form is cut off; there is no longer attachment to fame, status, appearance, or experiences. The mind then ceases to be shaken, abides completely in non-desire, utterly cuts off the various inner fetters, and reaches a truly stable state of liberation.  

I.2 The Benefits of Drawing Near to Good Friends and Wise Mentors  
On the path toward wisdom and liberation, associating with good friends and wise mentors plays a crucial role. Drawing near to good friends can increase wisdom and enable one to gain a real and clear capacity for discernment. Going further, drawing near to wise mentors not only likewise brings wisdom, but can also lead to the liberation from all suffering. Because good friends and wise mentors can provide guidance and reminders in right view and right conduct, they help one stay far from confusion and delusion, and thus possess real power for bringing suffering to an end and attaining liberation.  

I.3 Applying Mindfulness and the Essentials of Liberation in Practice  
When facing suffering, the basic attitudes of mindfulness and patient endurance of pain need to be applied universally. When a person encounters physical or mental pain and can observe and endure it with mindfulness, the mind can remain unresentful and unconfused in the midst of suffering, not swallowed up by grievance, irritation, and chaos. This attitude enables the mind to stay clear and stable, no longer reacting from blind habit. At the same time, the essential methods for liberation must pervade daily practice, serving to counteract negligence and arrogance. That is, in everyday life one should examine one’s speech, actions, and thoughts in light of the direction of liberation, thereby overcoming laziness and pride, preventing the mind from sinking into distraction and complacency, and instead progressing steadily toward the goal of liberation.  

I.4 Breaking Through Ignorance and the Power of Pure View  
At the core of the laws of liberation, breaking through the darkness of ignorance is a fundamental task. One must completely eliminate the inner foolishness and confusion, penetrate all darkness that veils wisdom, and bring the mind to a state of brightness. When one’s view becomes pure, one can, based on this pure view, advance step by step toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. Through such right view, a practitioner can attain unsurpassed awakening and at the same time accomplish a fearless meditative state, no longer shaken by fear and unease while in meditation.  

I.5 The Fulfilment of Wisdom and the Completion of Liberation  
When wisdom is truly fulfilled, it manifests in many deep and expansive dimensions. First, the practitioner can realize three kinds of penetrating knowledge and clearly discern past, present, and future, as well as body and mind, cause and effect, and birth and death. Next, there is mastery of the perception of others’ minds, seeing clearly what others are thinking without being deceived by appearances. Furthermore, the mind is endowed with vast, unobstructed intelligence, not blocked by any obstacle in its understanding and contemplation.  

Within the principles of wisdom-liberation, the practitioner relies on wisdom to relinquish attachment and, by fully understanding the true facts, extinguishes defilements. This principle is not merely an abstract theory; it is a concrete method universally applicable to all diligent practice and all practice goals. So long as one continues in practice to contemplate with wisdom and, by means of wisdom, lets go of attachment to people, events, circumstances, and self, one can gradually realize the extinction of defilements and finally attain liberation. Through this kind of practice with wisdom as the core, liberation is no longer just a theory but becomes an actually realizable attainment.  

II. The Vast Merits of Perfected Virtue and Wisdom  

II.1 Fundamental Principles of Perfected Virtue  
A person endowed with such qualities as wisdom, few desires, energy, and skill in teaching naturally becomes someone whom the non-deluded, the undefiled, and the undistracted commonly love and praise. Such a person does not take greed as the guiding force of life, but bases himself on few desires and contentment; does not make laziness a habit but takes tireless exertion as his direction; does not focus on self-benefit alone but is skilled in teaching and benefitting others. For those who are likewise not foolish, not defiled, and whose minds are not scattered, such qualities exert enormous attraction, so they unanimously feel deep affection and admiration for him. His virtues appear like a precious jewel radiating pure brilliance; not only is he himself pure and dignified, he also becomes a bright lamp illuminating others.  

II.2 Characteristics of Penetrating Wisdom and Thought  
Within the laws of penetrating wisdom, the first characteristic is sagacious understanding: the ability to skillfully comprehend truths and realities without being deluded by surface appearances. Next is agile thinking: when facing problems, the mind can move quickly and make appropriate judgments. Furthermore, there is sharp insight: the ability to pierce straight to the essence of things, clearly distinguishing right and wrong without vagueness. Such wisdom is not limited by forms; it can penetrate the various outward shapes and see the highest truth, personally realizing the supreme meaning of the teaching. When wisdom functions in this way, one no longer stops at mere concepts and words with regard to any situation, but can personally experience its true meaning.  

II.3 Dispelling Foolishness and Entering the Fearless Realm  
When wisdom deepens further, it can pierce through all darkness that obscures it so that foolishness and confusion disappear completely. When the inner ignorance is dispelled, the mind naturally inclines toward brightness and clarity. Relying on such a pure view, the practitioner can step by step advance toward unsurpassed perfect awakening, until finally achieving complete enlightenment. At the same time, he can reach a fearless meditative realm, in deep concentration no longer fearing birth and death or being afraid of change, for he has thoroughly understood the true nature of all phenomena.  

II.4 The Wisdom Attainments of Noble Disciples and Saints  
A noble disciple endowed with pure wisdom possesses two kinds of outstanding wisdom. The first is Dhamma-knowledge: clearly knowing the four kinds of cognition associated with each condition within dependent arising, and in each conditional factor truthfully observing its arising, ceasing, and function. The second is knowledge-in-conformity: understanding that all practitioners in the past and future have the same cognition regarding dependent arising, without deviation due to time or personal differences. Because of these two pure, immaculate kinds of wisdom, such a noble disciple is called one who has attained right view, who has penetrated the true Dhamma, who is endowed with learned wisdom, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, who possesses the noble, penetrative wisdom, and who has opened the gate that leads to the deathless.  

In terms of the attainment of wisdom, the noble disciple’s state also manifests as “having reached seeing,” having truly seen this right Dhamma and no longer being confused about the truth, and as being endowed with learning-wisdom and learning-clarity. To be endowed with learning-wisdom means having established firm and correct wisdom through study; to be endowed with learning-clarity means having a clear understanding of both the teaching and reality. Ultimately, he becomes a practitioner endowed with noble, penetrating wisdom—wisdom that is both clear and all-illuminating.  

II.5 The Praise of the Wise Noble Ones  
Wise and deeply insightful noble ones are universally praised because their moral discipline is pure and their hearts are tranquil. Such noble ones keep moral precepts strictly and are inwardly far from noise and agitation; thus they are extolled as the foremost among those who have reached the far shore. The “far shore” is the realm opposite to this shore of the round of birth and death; it is the realm of liberation and nirvāṇa. Those who appear as the foremost there do so precisely because profound and expansive wisdom, together with pure conduct, are their causes.  

III. Universal Laws of Mental Correspondence and Aggregation  

III.1 Basic Characteristics of Wholesome-Quality Mental States  
In the nature and qualities of the mind, a wholesome-quality mental state appears as a pure and clean state of will. Such a mind is not mixed with defilement or bias and has the characteristic of mutually lifting up and purifying. That is, a person with wholesome-quality mental states tends to resonate with similarly pure states of mind, so that the overall condition of the mind keeps rising higher instead of being dragged into inferior realms.  

Under the universal law across the three times, in past, present, and future, mental states of the same quality always combine with one another. Inferior wills combine with inferior wills; wholesome wills combine with wholesome wills. This shows that between mental natures there is a kind of mutual attraction: they naturally draw near to similar states of mind.  

III.2 Fundamental Law Relating Mental Nature and Modes of Existence  
The fundamental law of correspondence of mental nature states that the mode of existence of beings is closely related to the qualities of their minds. As a person’s mind is, so too are the life states toward which he inclines, resonates, and aggregates. Mental qualities of the same kind attract and gather with each other, mutually responding, eventually forming a shared life realm. This law is not confined to any particular era but applies across all dimensions of time. Whether in the past, present, or future, beings are all linked in correspondence with their mental qualities; like qualities attract like and co-exist together.  

From the perspective of classification of mental qualities and their corresponding expressions, those who share the same mental qualities respond to one another; similar traits mutually reinforce each other and ultimately give rise to corresponding modes of life. For example, wholesome mental qualities mutually enhance one another, while unwholesome mental qualities mutually pull one another along, causing the entire course of life to move in different directions.  

III.3 Aggregation of Mental Natures and the Correspondence of Negative and Positive Traits  
Under the general law of aggregation of mental natures, all beings gather and aggregate according to their mental qualities: those who share the same qualities mutually attract and co-exist. Observed in this light, one can distinguish the aggregations formed by negative and by positive traits.  

In the aggregation of negative traits, those who lack faith, lack a sense of shame, are of little learning, are lazy, are heedless or full of distracted thoughts, and are of unwholesome wisdom will each, respectively, resonate with and combine with others who share the same traits. Their mental natures echo each other, so that these negative qualities are continually reinforced within the group. In the aggregation of positive traits, those with faith, with a sense of shame, with a sense of moral dread, of much learning, of energetic effort, of right mindfulness, and of possessed wisdom also gather among those with the same traits, mutually encouraging one another, so that wholesome qualities grow ever more firm.  

The law of mental correspondence is universal in time: beings of the past, present, and future all follow this law and aggregate according to their traits. This mutual correspondence forms a constant pattern that does not change with the times.  

III.4 Concrete Relations and Combinations in Mental Correspondence  
Looking further, the fundamental law of mental correspondence states that beings associate and gather with those whose mental qualities are the same as theirs. Concretely, in the pattern of correspondence among negative traits, lack of shame corresponds with and joins to lack of shame; lack of moral dread with lack of moral dread; unwholesome wisdom with unwholesome wisdom. Conversely, in the pattern of correspondence among positive traits, a sense of shame corresponds with and joins to a sense of shame; moral dread with moral dread; possessed wisdom with possessed wisdom.  

In the rules of correspondence among combinations of traits, some traits also form fixed connections with others. For example, lack of shame will correspond with and join to little learning and unwholesome wisdom; lack of shame will also correspond with and join to laziness and unwholesome wisdom; likewise, lack of shame will correspond with and join to heedlessness and unwholesome wisdom. This shows that once one lacks a sense of shame, there often gathers along with it a collection of unwholesome traits such as little learning, unwillingness to learn, laziness, heedlessness, and unwholesome wisdom.  

In positive combinations, a sense of shame corresponds with and joins to much learning and possessed wisdom; a sense of shame also corresponds with and joins to energy and possessed wisdom; and likewise, a sense of shame corresponds with and joins to right mindfulness and possessed wisdom. That is, those who have a sense of shame mostly also tend toward diligent learning of the teaching, energetic exertion, maintaining mindfulness, and stabilizing their wholesome conduct by means of wisdom.  

These mental traits likewise have universal applicability across time. Mental traits in past lives follow the law of correspondence; mental traits in future lives also follow this law; the present life is the same. Whether past, present, or future, the fundamental law of mental correspondence is not affected by time: in any era, similar traits will necessarily correspond. This pattern is a universally existing truth.  

III.5 The Relationship Between Mental Nature and Its Corresponding Realm  
Mental nature not only corresponds internally with itself; it also joins with the external realm that corresponds with it. The law whereby mental nature unites with its realm states that the mental state of beings will relate to and combine with realms of the same quality. This pattern of connection exists universally in past, present, and future, and does not become invalid due to the passage of time.  

Specifically, a lazy mental nature will combine with a realm of laziness; a heedless mind with a heedless realm; unwholesome wisdom with a realm of unwholesome wisdom. Conversely, an energetic mental nature will combine with a realm of effort; right mindfulness with a realm of mindfulness; possessed wisdom with a realm of possessed wisdom. As the mind is, so too are the realms it inclines toward, responds to, and dwells in.  

Moreover, in the manifestations of correspondence between wholesome and unwholesome mental traits, those without faith, without shame, without moral dread, who are not tranquil, who have unwholesome wisdom, or unwholesome conduct, will gather with those of the same traits; whereas the faithful, the shameful, the morally dread-filled, the tranquil, the wise, and the morally disciplined gather with those who share their traits. From the perspective of fundamental intentions, the greedy, the angry, and those of wrong view gather with those with the same intentions; the non-greedy, the non-angry, and the right-viewed also gather with those of the same kind. These phenomena further confirm that mental nature and the realms and groups in which life is lived all aggregate according to correspondence.  

III.6 Summary and Unification of the Laws of Mental Correspondence  
Taken together, the fundamental law of mental correspondence states that all beings join and combine with those whose mental qualities are similar to their own; this law is universally present in past, present, and future lives. Those of little learning, the lazy, the unwholesome-wise, and the heedless all combine with their own kind; those of much learning, energy, possessed wisdom, and right mindfulness likewise each combine with their own kind. Because of such correspondence and aggregation, the entire process of the flow of life displays a certain pattern and direction.  

IV. Cutting Off Defilements and the Direct Realization of Wisdom  

IV.1 The Capacity for Direct Realization After Cutting Off the Secondary Defilements  
When the secondary defilements have been cut off, the state of the mind changes markedly. The mind becomes capable of direct realization; it is no longer veiled by corruption and delusion and possesses the power of intuitively seeing the truth in the present. In such a state, the practitioner can realize the true reality of phenomena right here and now, without relying on conjecture or imagination, but by means of a clear mind personally confronting and personally experiencing the real situation of all phenomena.  

IV.2 Knowing Through Wisdom and the Path of Liberation  
In all processes of knowing, only through wisdom can one know and see things as they truly are. Wisdom is the only path that can lead a practitioner to truly know liberation; any other approach, if separated from wisdom, cannot genuinely reach the core of liberation. Thus wisdom is not just one condition among many in practice; it is the indispensable fundamental force for realizing liberation.  

Among the characteristics of one who is liberated, the manifestation of wisdom is especially striking. A liberated person thoroughly knows the truth; she can contemplate this world and the other world, clearly understanding the causes and results and conditions of present and future lives. Her mind is not disturbed by phenomena; when facing all kinds of change, she remains unshaken. She does not fall into anger because of losing pleasure and does not respond with aversion to gain or loss. Her attachment to both favorable and unfavorable conditions has vanished entirely; even in the face of ease or difficulty, she no longer gives rise to craving or rejection. Such a practitioner has reached the far shore of existence, is far from all dust and defilement, knows the path of non-attachment, and understands how, through non-attachment, to realize nirvāṇa.  

V. The Multiple Attainments of the Faculties of Wisdom and Concentration  

V.1 The Nature and Function of the Faculty of Wisdom  
Among the five spiritual faculties, the characteristic of the faculty of wisdom is possessed wisdom, the ability to make correct decisions, and its alignment with the cessation of suffering. That is, the faculty of wisdom enables a person to distinguish right from wrong and choose appropriately, so that all decisions point toward the ending of suffering. Through the operation of this faculty, the practitioner can accomplish the wisdom that discerns arising and ceasing, clearly observing the arising and passing away of all phenomena, no longer mistaking the impermanent for the permanent.  

A lay follower (upāsaka), if complete in wisdom, will also display a similar state. A lay follower endowed with wisdom can make noble decisions; the choices he makes accord with the noble path, rather than following the worldly currents of greed, anger, and delusion. Such wisdom is directed toward the total cessation of suffering, causing him in daily life to move continually in the direction of the ending of suffering and, at the same time, to accomplish the wisdom that fully understands arising and ceasing.  

V.2 The Interaction Between the Faculties of Concentration and Wisdom  
When the faculty of concentration matures, it gives rise to a greater fulfilment of the faculty of wisdom. Based upon a concentrated mind, the practitioner can know clearly that saṃsāric wandering has no beginning, understanding that the flow of birth and death does not have a first starting point. This wisdom also allows him to see thoroughly that beings are covered by ignorance and bound by craving, and to understand that the reason beings wander without end is precisely because ignorance and craving tightly bind them.  

On this basis, he penetrates that with the cessation of ignorance, one attains peaceful nirvāṇa, knowing that if ignorance is brought to an end, one can obtain the peaceful nirvāṇic state. Going further, he directly contemplates the nirvāṇic realm where all formations have ceased, all grasping and rejecting have been abandoned, and craving is exhausted and lust relinquished. He personally sees the cessation of all karmic fabrications and the relinquishing of all taking and rejecting, and understands that when craving and desire are totally extinguished, nirvāṇa manifests therein.  

VI. General Laws of the Factors of Meditation and Their Wholesome–Unwholesome Combinations  

VI.1 Wholesome–Unwholesome Correspondence of the Five Factors of Meditation  
In the practice of meditation, there are five factors, namely the field of activity (meditation object), arousing (of the mind), reverential practice, regular practice, and responsive practice. Any pair among these five factors exhibits four kinds of wholesome–unwholesome correspondence: A wholesome and B unwholesome; B wholesome and A unwholesome; both A and B unwholesome; and both A and B wholesome. These four patterns show that in practice one must not only examine the wholesome or unwholesome nature of each individual factor, but also be mindful of the overall state that appears in the interaction between any two factors.  

In specific pairings of factors, the field of activity and arousing can appear in the four wholesome–unwholesome correspondences; the field of activity and reverential practice likewise show these four; the field of activity with regular practice and with responsive practice also manifest the same four patterns. Turning to combinations involving arousing and the other factors: arousing with reverential practice, with regular practice, and with responsive practice each show the same four correspondences. As for the combinations of reverential practice with regular practice, and reverential practice with responsive practice, they can all manifest the four patterns of A wholesome and B unwholesome, B wholesome and A unwholesome, both unwholesome, and both wholesome. Lastly, the combination of regular practice with responsive practice likewise shows these same four patterns.  

VI.2 The Universality of the General Law of Combinations  
The four wholesome–unwholesome correspondences described above apply not only to a few examples but to all pairings of the five factors. That is, any pairing among field of activity, arousing, reverential practice, regular practice, and responsive practice can be examined in terms of these four patterns. This general law of combinations allows practitioners to examine their meditative state with greater subtlety and to discern, for any given pair of factors, whether both are wholesome, or one wholesome and one unwholesome, or both unwholesome, so as to make appropriate adjustments.  

VII. Wisdom of the Noble Ones and Pure Decision  

VII.1 Multiple Dimensions of the Wisdom of Noble Ones  
When the attainment of wisdom reaches its peak, it displays many qualities and classifications. Among these are great wisdom, referring to vast and boundless wisdom that can encompass and illuminate an extremely wide range; broad wisdom, referring to wide-ranging wisdom that penetrates all aspects of the teaching; vast-and-great wisdom, which is both extensive and great in scope, combining breadth and depth. Deep wisdom refers to profound, penetrating wisdom that goes down to the very root of the Dhamma and does not remain at the surface.  

In addition, there is incomparable wisdom, meaning wisdom that is without peer and matched by no one; magnanimous wisdom, which is grand and open, with a very broad heart and vision. “Much wisdom” indicates rich and multifaceted wisdom, endowed with multiple capacities for contemplation and discernment. Swift wisdom is quickly accomplished wisdom, able to understand rapidly when encountering circumstances; light wisdom is nimble and flexible wisdom, able to respond flexibly to change; agile wisdom is sharp and quick wisdom; rapid wisdom is swiftly penetrating wisdom that can quickly reach the core of what is observed; incisive wisdom is keen and decisive wisdom that can immediately cut off doubt; and discriminative wisdom is wisdom that excels at analysis and decision, able to choose correctly and without error among many possibilities.  

VII.2 Pure Wisdom and Noble Decision  
When a practitioner is endowed with such deep, vast, and multifaceted wisdom, he is able to make truly noble decisions. He is no longer swayed by emotion and bias but takes pure view as the basis, and in facing all situations can make choices that accord with the direction of liberation. Such wisdom not only leads to the complete cessation of suffering, but also gives him a penetrating understanding of arising and ceasing, because he sees the conditions for the arising of all phenomena and the processes of their cessation, and understands their impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and non-self.  

VII.3 Mutual Praise Among Noble Ones  
Among noble ones, the praise of wisdom is also a noteworthy phenomenon. Noble ones whose wisdom is deep and vast are praised by other noble ones because their moral discipline is pure and their inner hearts are tranquil; they are recognized as the most excellent among those who have reached the far shore. This mutual praise does not arise from worldly desire for name and gain but from genuine respect for pure wisdom and pure conduct.  

VIII. Accomplishing Pure View and Entering the Stream of the Noble Path  

VIII.1 Pure View and the Marks of Entering the Stream  
When a practitioner accomplishes pure view, he is no longer dominated by wrong views and delusion, and has a firm and clear understanding of the true Dhamma. At this point, he not only sees the true Dhamma but can also be called one who has attained right view, who has penetrated the Dhamma, who is endowed with learned wisdom, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, and who possesses the noble, penetrative wisdom. This state indicates that he has already entered upon the great path leading to the deathless realm and has begun an irreversible course of practice.  

VIII.2 Continuing Application of the Practice of Liberation  
After this, the practitioner must still apply the essential methods of liberation throughout daily life to counteract negligence and arrogance, and, by means of wisdom, to relinquish any newly arisen attachments. The application of the principles of wisdom-liberation is universally suitable for all diligent practice and all practice goals. As long as one constantly contemplates with wisdom, all forms of clinging will gradually loosen, defilements will be extinguished, and liberation will finally be fully realized.  

VIII.3 Purity of Mind and the Transformation of One’s Mode of Life  
When the mind inclines toward purity and clarity and possesses the characteristic of mutual uplift and purification, one’s entire mode of life changes accordingly. Since beings are all linked in correspondence with their mental qualities and like qualities attract and co-exist with like, a purified mind will inevitably lead a person toward purer modes of existence. This transformation is not accomplished in a single leap, but gradually appears and is consolidated through long-term contemplative wisdom, continuous counteracting of defilements, and unceasing association with good friends and wise mentors.
