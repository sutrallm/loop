I. The Delusion of Worldly Pleasures and Dependence

I.1 The Joys and Sorrows Brought by Dependence

In the world, people often feel joy and sorrow because of various objects such as children and wealth. When beloved children are safe and doing well, joy arises in the heart; when wealth increases, one feels proud and satisfied. However, once children encounter misfortune or wealth is lost, worry, grief, pain, anxiety, and vexation immediately surge up within. This shows that as long as the heart depends on something, sorrow and vexation will inevitably accompany it; if one does not depend, external changes will not give rise to these forms of suffering.

Likewise, our grief and unease over someone’s misfortune do not fundamentally arise from the external event itself, but from craving and attachment toward that person. If there is no craving and attachment toward someone, then even upon hearing of that person’s misfortune, the heart will not therefore generate grief, distress, or anxiety. Conversely, if there is a strong attachment to one’s children, when they meet with misfortune, intense grief and suffering will arise in the heart. Or if one originally has no acquaintance with a stranger, but later, through seeing or hearing about them, desires and infatuated love arise, then when this person encounters misfortune, grief and suffering will arise in the heart in the same way. All these experiences show: suffering always arises together with attachment.

I.2 The Source and Nature of Worldly Sensual Pleasure

What the world calls “sensual pleasure” actually takes the five kinds of sensual objects as its source and support. As long as visible forms for eye-consciousness, sounds for ear-consciousness, smells for nose-consciousness, tastes for tongue-consciousness, and tangible objects for body-consciousness have the qualities of being pleasing, lovable, enjoyable, and capable of arousing sensual desire, they can stir up desire and attachment in the mind. When these five kinds of sense objects become conditions that arouse joy and pleasure in the mind, this joy that arises dependent on the five sensual pleasures is called “sensual pleasure.”

Yet such sensual pleasure is essentially dependent in nature. When a person relies on some particular sensual pleasure and feels happy because of it, and feels that their inner longing is fully satisfied in it, this state constitutes what is called “the highest sensual love.” In this state, one believes one has obtained all one ever wanted, and thus delights deeply in it, not realizing it is precisely this dependence that tightly binds one with sensual pleasure.

II. The Nature of Desire and Craving

II.1 The Root and Characteristics of Sensual Love and Greed

Sensual love is a kind of greed in the heart; it makes beings delight in the objects they come into contact with and, because of this delight, become bound by them. It is not merely liking, but an attached love that carries the character of grasping and demanding. Because people give themselves over to heedlessness and indulgence in it, they cannot turn back from this bondage, and cannot return from sensual love to a clear and lucid state. Misfortune and suffering indeed arise from such desire.

Sensual love is oriented toward the future; its results ripen in the future. Although it may be accompanied by pleasure and enjoyment in the present, its eventual result is pain, vexation, and disaster, not truly secure happiness. Greed is kindled because the mind operates based on inverted (deluded) cognition. When cognition is inverted—taking the impermanent as permanent, mistaking suffering for happiness, taking what is impure as pure, and taking what is not-self as self—the mind will develop attachment upon these mistaken cognitions, and thus the flame of greed is set ablaze.

II.2 Craving as the Fundamental Source of Mental Activity and Existence

Craving is not only the concrete manifestation of greed; it is also the fundamental source of various mental activities and emotions within. Greed, anger, joy, aversion, fear, and all kinds of emotions all arise from craving; the arising and functioning of all mental activities also have their root in craving. The existence of the body likewise arises from craving. The ordinary person’s attachment to sensual love is like vines that spread all through a forest, endlessly entangling, and like a tree trunk growing from its roots—supported and nourished from the very foundation by craving.

The scriptures clearly point out six forms in which craving appears: craving for forms, craving for sounds, craving for smells, craving for tastes, craving for tangibles, and craving for dhammas (various mind-states, thoughts, and mental objects). These six cravings are also called “the six loves” or “the six kinds of craving.” Viewed from a broader perspective, craving can also be divided into three kinds: craving for sensual pleasure, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. Craving for sensual pleasure is the craving for sense enjoyment; craving for existence is the craving for being and the continuation of life; craving for non-existence or annihilation is the craving for extinction and non-being. These three kinds of craving constitute the root of suffering and function as the driving force behind future existence and rebirth in saṃsāra.

Among the many conditions that sustain the activities of life, the “four nutriments” (four kinds of food) are considered especially fundamental, and the reason the four nutriments arise—their fundamental cause, root, arising, and origin—lies in “craving.” Among these, “volitional (mental) nutriment” is essentially the mind’s will, seeking, and longing; what it cognizes and corresponds to are precisely the three kinds of craving. Regarding volitional nutriment, its result is described as: for the noble disciple, there is nothing further that needs to be done; final liberation has been attained. This shows that when the craving on which volitional nutriment relies is seen as it really is and completely transcended, liberation is accomplished.

III. The Fundamental Structure of Ignorance and Bondage

III.1 Ignorance and Wrong Views as the Root of Bondage

Among all forms of bondage, ignorance is regarded as the most fundamental. Ignorance is not mere simple stupidity, but a failure to know the truth as it really is, especially manifested in two extreme views: one is annihilationism, the view that everything is utterly cut off at death; the other is eternalism, the clinging to an unchanging eternal entity or self. Both of these extreme views deviate from reality, preventing the mind from correctly facing birth-and-death and existence, thereby deepening the fetters of saṃsāra.

The fundamental reason rebirth continues is precisely the failure to know the Four Noble Truths as they really are. When one does not know the nature of suffering, the origin of suffering (its accumulation), the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering, one cannot discern what should be abandoned and what should be cultivated, and thus continues to revolve in ignorance. To completely bring saṃsāra to an end, the dhammas that must be abandoned include ignorance and “craving for existence,” that is, the craving for existence itself.

III.2 The Three Poisons, the Five Sensual Pleasures, the Twelve Sense Fields, and the Endless Ocean

The structure of bondage also includes three defilements, namely the three poisons: greed, hatred, and delusion. Greed causes the mind to covet; hatred causes the mind to loathe; delusion causes the mind to be confused and unclear. At the same time, the field in which the five kinds of sensual desire operate—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles—constitutes the objects beings chase after in daily life, becoming a vast battlefield of craving. In addition, the twelve sense fields—six sense bases and six sense objects—are like a great whirlpool, causing beings to sink deeper and deeper in the interaction between senses and their objects.

Desire is likened to an unsatisfiable ocean: no matter how much water flows in, it is never thereby “full.” In the same way, no matter how many forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects beings obtain, their greed and sensual attachment are hard to truly satisfy. This endless hunger is one of the deep reasons why suffering in the world is limitless and without end.

IV. The Bondage and Oppression of the World

IV.1 How Joy and Desire Bind the World

The world is bound because of its pursuit of joy and desire. The “stride” of the world—its overall direction of movement—is precisely the search for joy. Beings run about everywhere only to look for objects that can bring happiness and satisfaction, yet they do not realize that this very pursuit is the chain of bondage itself.

At the same time, the world is pressed by death, covered over by aging, sustained by craving, and established upon suffering. Death is like a coercive force that cannot be evaded; aging is like a garment that increasingly weighs upon one; craving is the driving force that keeps life continually going on. The entire structure of worldly existence is founded upon suffering rather than upon genuine happiness. Craving is like a spear that pierces through the world, making it hard for beings to escape its sharp pain; desire causes the world to remain in a state of burning heat. According to the teaching, cutting off sensual love is the accomplishment of nibbāna.

In the context of practice, it is further taught that joy and greed toward things are like a killer wielding a sharp sword who can cut off the practitioner’s Dharma-body and life of wisdom. That is to say, sensual attachment is not just an ordinary psychological tendency, but a fatal obstruction capable of destroying the path to liberation.

IV.2 The Four Elements and the Attachment Aroused by Pleasure and Pain

In the constitution of body and mind, the “four elements”—earth, water, fire, and wind—play an important role. When the four elements present pleasant feelings in beings’ bodies and the external world, beings tend to develop greed and attachment, wanting to tightly hold on to such pleasure; when the four elements present painful feelings, beings tend to develop aversion, trying to escape or reject them.

Yet rejoicing in the four elements is, in essence, rejoicing in suffering, because the changes of the four elements ultimately cannot be separated from the nature of impermanence and suffering. If one rejoices in the four elements, one cannot obtain liberation; if one does not rejoice in the four elements—that is, no longer develops greed or aversion toward the pleasures and pains they bring—this is “not rejoicing in suffering,” and only thus is liberation possible.

IV.3 All Phenomena Are Burning

Seen through deep contemplation, all phenomena are burning. They burn with the fire of greed, burn with the fire of hatred, and burn with the fire of delusion. Moreover, the processes of birth, aging, and death themselves burn beings like flames; worry, grief, pain, vexation, and despair also burn fiercely in the heart. All this shows that the world is not a solid and static paradise, but a burning house consumed by the three poisons and by the pressure of birth-and-death.

Furthermore, any clinging whatsoever is the root of suffering. Clinging is described as a kind of disease that must be cured; it is a swelling, symbolizing an unhealthy accumulation in the mind; it is also an arrow deeply lodged in the heart, causing one to suffer pain for a long time. As long as this arrow is not pulled out, the mind can hardly obtain true peace.

V. Sense Objects, the Six Loves, and the Operation of Bondage

V.1 The Law of Bondage Between the Six Sense Bases, the Six Sense Objects, and Mental Activity

When the objects cognized by the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—have the nature of being pleasing, lovable, joyful, delightful, and capable of arousing desire, if the mind develops joy, praise, and infatuated attachment toward them, sensual love will arise. Once there is sensual love, bondage arises. The things that can serve as conditions for bondage are precisely the various objects known through the six senses; because these objects are pleasing, lovable, joyful, and delightful, they can trigger thoughts of desire in the mind. Bondage is the greed the mind develops toward these bond-agents; this greed itself is the actual state of the mind being bound by those objects.

The wise do not regard external bonds—such as physical tying up or environmental restriction—as the most fundamental bondage. They understand that the truly powerful bondage is the internal attachment to sensual pleasures. This bondage appears outwardly gentle, even mistaken for happiness, but in reality it is extremely firm and very difficult to escape. When the mind dwells in joy and bondage, even if one calls oneself a practitioner, one is only “dwelling accompanied (by a companion).” Even if one lives in a secluded place, as long as craving for sense objects has not been extinguished in the heart, this craving is like a second companion constantly by one’s side; such a person is in substance still merely a “dweller with a companion,” and has not truly gone far from bondage.

V.2 The Six Loves and the Stream and Whirlpool of the Five Sensual Pleasures

The six loves corresponding to the six sense bases—love of forms, love of sounds, love of smells, love of tastes, love of tangibles, and love of dhammas—constitute the concrete domains of sensual craving. Whenever craving arises toward any of these six types of objects, it forms a secondary defilement in the mind. This law applies to all six classes of objects: whenever craving arises toward them, secondary defilements appear in the heart and bondage is deepened. If one indulges in the five sensual pleasures, one is described as “being seized by the whirlpool,” like falling into a powerful eddy, swept away by a rapid current and unable to free oneself.

V.3 Māra’s Bait and the Danger of Sensual Pleasure

In the teaching it is said that the six kinds of pleasurable “baits” of the senses are like the bait thrown out by Māra, the evil one. When beings feel joy, praise, and attachment toward these six baits, it is as if they have swallowed Māra’s fishhook. The result is to fall into misfortune and ruin, to become Māra’s captive, trapped in the cycle of birth-and-death and unable to save oneself. This also shows that attachment to any sensory domain leads to bondage; conversely, non‑attachment in any sensory domain leads to liberation.

At the same time, if one mistakenly takes the senses or the sense objects themselves to be bondage, then the practice of the holy life cannot lead to the complete cessation of suffering. Precisely because bondage in fact lies in “sensual defilement” and not in the organs or the objects themselves, only by cutting off sensual defilement can the holy life truly accomplish the complete ending of suffering.

VI. Grasping, Secondary Defilements, and the Accumulation of Suffering

VI.1 The Nature and Objects of Grasping and Bondage

In the interaction of the six sense bases and six sense objects, as soon as sensual defilement arises toward these six bases or six objects, this sensual defilement is defined as “grasping”; likewise, this sensual defilement itself is defined as “bondage.” In other words, bondage does not lie in external things, but in that one thought of grasping in the mind. The nature of bondage is the desire and attachment that arise toward objects; this is precisely the root of the various bonds and sufferings.

Among the forms of clinging that should be abandoned, three are especially pointed out: “desire, greed, and desire-greed.” Whenever one delights in coveting any type of object, this constitutes “desire”; on this basis, the deepened sense of possession and holding forms a stronger “greed”; and when one once again develops longing and stickiness toward desire itself, this constitutes “desire-greed.” These are all kinds of grasping that should be thoroughly cut off.

VI.2 The Law of the Growth of Grasping and the Accumulation of Suffering

As long as one abides in savoring the pleasure of the phenomena one grasps, one will cause inward craving to increase. When craving increases, it further gives rise to grasping; conditioned by grasping, the process of “existence” unfolds, and from this there follow birth, aging, death, and all sorts of suffering and distress. In this way, the complete arising of the accumulation of all suffering is formed. This is precisely the law of the accumulation of suffering.

If with regard to the five aggregates of clinging—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—one does not separate from greed, does not separate from desire, does not separate from love, does not separate from craving, does not separate from fever, and does not separate from thirsting craving, then when the five aggregates of clinging transform and change, sorrow, grief, pain, worry, and vexation will arise in the heart. In other words, suffering does not arise merely from change itself, but because amid change one continues to cling to the five aggregates of clinging and cannot separate from desire and love; thus one suffers because of change.

At the same time, sorrow, grief, pain, worry, and vexation also stem from wrong cognition and attachment toward the changing state of the world. When one does not clearly see impermanence and misconstrues change—taking the brief as long-lasting, taking what will decay as reliable—then when change arrives, intense emotional upheaval and suffering arise.

VII. The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Five Aggregates of Clinging, and the Root of the Four Nutriments

VII.1 The Root of Suffering: Craving and the Five Aggregates of Clinging

In the framework of the Four Noble Truths and the explanation of “the Noble Truth of the Origin (Accumulation) of Suffering,” it is clearly stated that the root of suffering is craving. This craving leads to rebirth, accompanied by longing and delight for future existence, and feeling joy in various situations. It seeks satisfaction everywhere and roams in all kinds of realms, and it is divided into three forms: craving for sensual pleasure, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. These three cravings are called “the root of suffering: craving,” and they are the fundamental cause of the accumulation of all suffering.

The five aggregates of clinging—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—take desire as their basic root cause. Precisely because the five aggregates of clinging rest upon desire, when greed, desire, love, thirst, fever, and craving arise toward them, tight clinging is formed; when the five aggregates of clinging change, sorrow, grief, pain, worry, and vexation then arise accordingly.

VII.2 The Root of Suffering and the Simile of the Palmyra Tree

The “root” of suffering is explicitly defined as “craving,” that is, craving and attachment toward the phenomena arising at the six sense fields. To “dig up the root of suffering” is to cut off all of this craving so that it no longer grows. Once the root of suffering has been dug up, it is like a palmyra tree whose crown has been cut off and which will never sprout again. Cutting off craving so that the root of suffering no longer grows, like a headless palmyra tree, means that there is no longer any possibility of future birth. This is the result when the root of suffering has been completely eradicated.

VII.3 The Four Nutriments, the Root of Craving, and the Continuation of Life

The four nutriments—edible food, contact as nutriment, mental volition as nutriment, and consciousness as nutriment—each arise with craving as their fundamental cause, root, arising, and origin. When a living being lays aside its present body and is reborn in another body, the driving force behind this process is also “craving.” Craving is the root that allows life to continue flowing, causing beings to come and go between births and deaths without rest.

VIII. Lying, Wrong Cognition, and Emotional Upheaval

VIII.1 The Pursuit of Sensual Pleasure Behind Lying

Behind the act of lying, the inner driving force is often an intense pursuit of sensual pleasure. When a person’s mind is occupied and confused by greed, it becomes easy for them to speak what is untrue in order to satisfy their desires. Because they are deluded by sensual pleasure, they cannot recognize the correct path; their situation is like that of fish caught in a net, hard to escape. This shows that greed not only leads to inner suffering, but also distorts behavior and speech, driving a person away from the right path.

VIII.2 Wrong Cognition and Emotional Fluctuation

The reactions of the mind and various negative emotions often arise from wrong cognition and attachment toward the changing state of the world. When one does not understand that all things are in constant change, one will, at the time of loss and alteration, give rise to strong reactions of sorrow, grief, pain, worry, and vexation. If the heart is driven by craving and wrong views, and clings to love as “happiness, joy, and pleasure,” yet does not know as it really is the cessation of love, then wrong views will arise further. Conversely, if one does not regard love as happiness, joy, and pleasure, and can know as it really is the cessation of love, then such wrong views will not arise.

IX. Desire and Wrong Views, Obstructions and the Not‑Yet‑Emptying of Desires

IX.1 The Opposition Between “Desires Not Yet Emptied” and “Empty of Desires”

In the progress of practice, “emptiness of desires” is an important criterion. “Desires not yet emptied” means that one has not yet been able to abandon greed, desire, love, craving, fever, and thirsting craving toward various desires. As long as these attachments to desire still exist in the mind, it shows that one has not truly emptied desire and still remains in a state ruled by desires.

IX.2 One of the Eight Obstructions: Being Caught in the Whirlpool of the Five Sensual Pleasures

Among the eight kinds of obstruction, there is one called “being seized by the whirlpool,” whose concrete meaning is sinking into the five sensual pleasures. When a person is strongly attracted by the five sensual pleasures, their mind is like being drawn into a whirlpool by a rapid current, hard to extricate; this state not only obstructs practice, but also plunges them even more deeply into the darkness of suffering.

X. Delight, Fundamental Activities, and the Growth of Suffering

X.1 Cognition of the Four Noble Truths and the Growth of Delight

Whether one knows the Four Noble Truths as they really are or not directly determines whether one will delight in the fundamental activities (karmic formations) that lead to suffering. When one fails to know and see the Four Noble Truths as they really are, one easily delights in and clings to those basic factors that in fact lead to suffering. Once delight arises, these fundamental activities will increase; if one does not delight in them, they will not increase.

Whether these fundamental activities increase or not further determines whether beings fall into the depths of suffering or can gradually free themselves from it. When one delights in these fundamental factors, they give rise to a series of painful results—birth, aging, death, sorrow, grief, pain, worry, and vexation; if one does not delight in them, these painful results will not be magnified.

X.2 A Summary of Delight and the Darkness of Suffering

In summary: delight in the fundamental factors that lead to suffering causes these factors to grow; not delighting in the fundamental factors that lead to suffering prevents them from growing. This is directly related to whether one falls into the darkness of suffering or does not. Delight is the force that drives suffering to continually increase; non‑delight is the key that allows suffering to cease.

XI. The Principles of Cutting Off Greed, Abandoning Desire, and Liberation

XI.1 The Basic Principle of Abandoning Desire and Leaving Suffering

To truly leave suffering, one must grasp a fundamental principle: with regard to any thing whatsoever, if one can understand it, know it clearly, abandon desire for it, and let it go, then one can cut off suffering. That is to say, one first uses correct understanding and true knowing to see the nature of things; next, on the emotional level, one abandons desire and no longer generates craving toward them; finally, in behavior and attitude, one relinquishes clinging—thus suffering will cease accordingly.

In the operation of various feelings, especially the arising and ceasing of pleasant feeling, this principle is particularly crucial. When one feels joy, praise, and infatuation toward pleasant feeling, the joyful mind arises; when one does not feel joy, does not praise, and does not cling to pleasant feeling, the joyful mind ceases. When the joyful mind arises, suffering arises; when the joyful mind ceases, suffering ceases. This core principle applies universally to all pleasant feelings perceived by the six senses: whether one clings or not determines whether the joyful mind arises or ceases, and thereby determines whether suffering arises or ceases.

XI.2 Sensory Liberation and the Practice of Non‑Rejoicing

On the level of sensory liberation, the key is no longer to generate delight, love, and craving toward sense objects. As soon as attachment arises in any sensory domain, bondage follows; conversely, as soon as non‑attachment is maintained in any sensory domain, liberation is realized. Not rejoicing in the four elements is precisely not rejoicing in suffering, and in this way one can move away from the root of suffering.

If one feels joy, praise, and attachment toward the six baits—that is, the pleasurable objects of the six senses—it is equivalent to swallowing Māra’s fishhook, with the result of falling into misfortune and ruin and becoming Māra’s prisoner. If one is alert to this, one will understand that when facing alluring situations, the key is not to flee from the senses themselves, but to prevent the arising of sensual defilement in the heart.

XI.3 Cutting Off Greed, Pulling Out the Root of Suffering, and the State of an Arahant

In the practice of cutting off greed, one must thoroughly remove from the root the craving and attachment to sensual pleasures, that is, completely cut off the root causes of evil desires, covetousness, and craving. To cut off sensual love is nibbāna; to cut off craving is to dig up the root of suffering so that, like a headless palmyra tree, it never grows again, and thus there is no longer any possibility of future birth.

The final state of liberation is the extinction of greed, hatred, and ignorance, the “destruction of the taints” attained by an arahant. In this state, the root of suffering has been completely uprooted; craving for phenomena arising at the six sense fields no longer exists, and the mind is no longer driven by greed, hatred, and delusion.

XI.4 Craving as the Overall Root of Saṃsāra and Suffering

Taken together, the arising of all suffering in the past, present, and future has desire as its root and cause. The origin of suffering is craving; craving is accompanied by longing and delight for future existence and seeks satisfaction everywhere in various circumstances, causing life to revolve ceaselessly in saṃsāra. When a living being leaves its present body and is reborn in another, the driving force behind this process is precisely craving; craving is the root that allows life to keep flowing on.

At the same time, if one regards love as happiness, joy, and pleasure and does not know as it really is the cessation of love, then related wrong views will arise and bondage will deepen; if one does not regard love as happiness, joy, and pleasure and can know as it really is the cessation of love, then such wrong views will not arise and one can move toward liberation. To be completely freed from saṃsāra, one must simultaneously cut off ignorance and craving for existence, know and see the Four Noble Truths as they really are, cease delighting in all fundamental factors that lead to suffering, and pull out the root of sensual love so that the mind is no longer drawn by craving. Only thus can one truly abandon desire and leave suffering, and realize ultimate freedom and liberation.
