<article>
I. The Boundary of the World and the Embodied Life

I.1 The Situation of the Ultimate Limit of the World

The ultimate limit of the world is described as a state in which there is no arising, no decay, no death, and no renewed arising. In this state, all arising and ceasing have come to an end, and no new stream of life appears. However, this boundary of the world is not a place that can be reached by external, physical means. Whether one walks, searches, or uses any bodily action to seek and travel to some distant limit, one still cannot thereby truly arrive at the ultimate boundary of the world, nor by reaching some boundary through bodily action come to know the end of the world.

I.2 The Inward Nature of the World’s Boundary

The boundary of the world actually exists within oneself, not at some outer end-point in space. This boundary is said to be contained within this very body of a fathom’s length—about the height of a person—a body endowed with thought and consciousness. In other words, within this body that possesses mental and conscious activity are contained the boundary and ultimate limit of the world. Thus, realization of the world’s ultimate boundary is not attained by running outward, but is intimately bound up with this very body-and-mind that is endowed with thought and awareness.

II. The True Dharma and the Qualities of One Who Practices for Liberation

II.1 The Inner Attainments of One Who Has Completed the Pure Brahma-Faring

Those who can truly penetrate to the boundary of the world are those who have completed the pure brahma-faring, the holy life. Such a person is a practitioner whose purity is fully perfected, a virtuous and wise one who understands the true reality of the world. His heart is tranquil, no longer disturbed by defilements; inner turmoil and afflictions have ceased. Not only does he know the boundary of the world, but consequently he has no longer any seeking in regard to this life or a future life; he no longer hopes for or pursues any realms in this present world or in worlds to come.

II.2 The World-Transcending Character of the True Dharma

The true Dharma itself has a world-transcending character. One who practices this true Dharma does not cling to any realm, whether of this world or another world, and does not take any formed or formless state as the ultimate goal. This true Dharma also transcends all brilliant and splendid phenomena: even the most radiant, most illustrious states are not adequate as its measure. By comparison, the true Dharma is like a lion—supreme and majestic—utterly beyond the reach of jackals, signifying its incomparable nobility and transcendence above all other dharmas.

II.3 The Liberated State That Transcends the Form and Formless Realms

The state realized by liberation is not confined to the desire realm or the human realm; it transcends even the realms of beings in the form realm, and further, surpasses the realms of beings who abide in the formless realm. That is, even the beings of the form heavens, and those who move within the formless spheres without material form, have not yet reached the final end. True attainment of liberation is a state that transcends all levels of existence in both the form and formless realms.

II.4 The Bondage of Sensual Craving and the Limitation of the Heavenly Realms

Even the various heavenly realms are, from the perspective of liberation, still seen as falling within the domain bound by sensual craving. All heavens are within the range of bondage by craving, and still lie under the influence of Māra’s power; they are not truly free states beyond all fetters. This shows that even if one is born in the heavens and enjoys superior karmic rewards, one has still not gone beyond the sphere of craving and the power of Māra, but remains within samsara.

II.5 Being Hopeful or Hopeless Regarding the Future Life

In regard to future existence, one’s mental attitude can be distinguished as “hopeful” and “hopeless.” “Hopeful” means that in one’s mind one reflects on and longs for obtaining some form, feeling, perception, volitional formation, or consciousness in a future life—one still has expectations and wishes directed toward the five aggregates in the future. “Hopeless,” by contrast, means that in one’s mind one no longer thinks about or hopes to obtain any form, feeling, perception, volitional formation, or consciousness in a future life at all; one has no desire for a future aggregate-body. This attitude reflects the cessation of projecting wishes onto rebirth and samsaric continuation.

III. The Universal Law of Birth, Aging, and Death, and the Pressure of Aging and Death

III.1 The Universal Law That Whatever Is Born Must Age and Die

The universal law of arising and ceasing has its root in “having been born.” So long as there is birth, there must inevitably follow aging and death. No living being can escape the process of aging and dying; there is no sentient being exempt from this condition. Since “having been born” itself is the root of old age and death, wherever life exists, there necessarily exists the process that leads toward aging and death.

III.2 The Pressure of Aging and Death Like Great Mountains in Empty Space

The pressure exerted by aging and death is described as exceedingly intense. It is likened to vast mountains in the empty sky closing in from the four directions, pressing down on all living beings, leaving no gap and no escape. Under this crushing advance, all beings are eventually ground to dust. This onslaught of aging and death is regarded as the terrible great horror that destroys the human race. Since human birth itself is extremely difficult and rare to obtain, the arrival of aging and death appears all the more terrifying. Regardless of status—whether kṣatriya, brāhmaṇa, vaiśya, śūdra, or even caṇḍāla—no one can escape the pressure of aging and death; in the face of aging and death, all caste distinctions vanish.

III.3 The Powerlessness of Armies, Mantras, and Wealth Against Aging and Death

Confronted with the pressure of aging and death, all external worldly powers are shown to be helpless. Elephantry, cavalry, chariotry, infantry—all kinds of military forces—have no means of defense when aging and death press in; there is no room at all to resist. Even the mantra-battles waged by ministers skilled in powerful spells cannot ward off the onslaught of aging and death. Likewise, even if one possesses vast stores of gold and treasure, when aging and death draw near there is still no way to defend oneself, no opening for escape. Aging and death thus stand out as an absolute power that towers above all worldly might, magic, and wealth.

III.4 The Swift Flow of the World That Cannot Be Overtaken

In describing worldly phenomena, it is said that in this world there is a kind of speed more rapid than the movement of sun and moon, a speed that even surpasses the swift going of the gods who travel before the sun and moon. That is, even those gods believed to be extremely swift, who move ahead of the sun and moon, still do not match some other, even more rapid process. This highlights the unimaginably swift nature of change and flow in the world.

IV. The Structure of Samsara, the Law of Repetition, and Beginningless Circling

IV.1 The Domains of Samsara and the Modes of Existence of Beings

The domains of samsara pervade all kinds of realms of life. Samsara exists among beings in the exalted planes who have material form, and it exists equally among beings in realms without material form. In other words, whether among higher beings with bodies of form, or among beings entirely without form who exist only by way of mind and consciousness, all alike fall within the scope of samsara; there is not a single exception.

IV.2 The Law of Repetition as the Pattern for the Operation of All Things

All things and all life processes follow a law of repeated occurrence. This repetition is not just something occasional; it is the common pattern according to which all existence functions. Because actions are repeated and habits recur, life is able to continue without end within samsara. Repetitive action is the fundamental reason why life keeps circling in rebirth. This repetition is plainly visible in everyday phenomena: farmers must repeatedly sow seeds in order to keep reaping grain; the sky must repeatedly send down rain in order continually to moisten the earth; mendicants repeatedly go for alms, donors repeatedly give, and thus both sides continue again and again to obtain food and merit. From sowing and rainfall to begging and giving, these activities, through their recurrence, sustain the operation of life and society.

IV.3 The Repetitive Nature of the Cycle of Birth and Death

The law of repetition is even more evident in the cycle of birth and death. Beings repeatedly enter the mother’s womb and are born again; this entering of the womb and being born does not occur only once, but happens over and over. Likewise, beings repeatedly go toward the charnel ground and to death. Entering the womb and being born, heading for the grave and dying: such alternation and unceasing recurrence of life and death is precisely the nature of samsara. Samsara is not a single, one-time event, but the ever-repeated cycle of birth and death.

IV.4 Ignorance and Folly as the Root of Repetitive Samsaric Circling

The deep root that sustains all this repetition is ignorance and folly. Ignorance and delusion are the fundamental cause that keeps beings repeatedly entering samsara without rest. Because of folly, beings endlessly repeat the same behavioral patterns, thus undergoing fatigue and suffering again and again. Weariness and oppression by suffering are not accidental; rather, it is ignorance that makes beings pace back and forth along the same path, unable to extricate themselves.

IV.5 Samsara as Beginningless, Without Boundary, and Unknowable in Its First Point

Samsara itself is proclaimed to have no starting point; there is no first beginning that can be indicated. It has neither a knowable origin nor a definable boundary, but is a beginningless and boundless process of circling. Within such samsara, beings are veiled by ignorance and bound by craving, and thus cannot know the primordial origin of this circling; they cannot discover where their wandering began or determine any “first point.” Because ignorance covers them and craving binds them, beings revolve in samsara without knowing their own past beginning; however far back one may trace, no true starting point can be found.

From beginningless time, beings have been in this river of samsara, continually oppressed by various sufferings, whose initial arising cannot be known. This oppression is not merely a brief phase, but recurs again and again throughout the long, beginningless circling. Even if one day the great oceans should dry up, Mount Sumeru crumble, and the earth deteriorate and disintegrate, yet so long as beings are still covered by ignorance and bound by craving, their suffering in samsara will still have no end. Even when the natural world undergoes vast decay and collapse, the sufferings of beings fettered by ignorance and craving will still stretch on without limit, without a terminating point.

IV.6 A Striking Simile for the Disparity in the Proportions of Life’s Circling

To illustrate the actual situation of life’s circling within samsara, a highly vivid simile is presented. When one compares the tiny dust on a fingertip with the vast earth, the disparity of quantity is immeasurably great. This enormous difference is used as a metaphor for the real proportions with which beings circulate among the six realms of rebirth, indicating that among the different destinations and states within the six realms, the numerical differences are as great as those between a speck of dust and the whole earth.

IV.7 The Unbroken Oppression of the Sufferings of Samsara

In explaining samsara, it is clearly stated that from beginningless time beings have continually been oppressed by various sufferings, whose starting point cannot be known. This oppression has no traceable source, yet persists in every instance of birth and death. The very nature of samsara is this endless recurrence of suffering and weariness from beginningless time onwards: until ignorance and craving no longer bind beings, this oppression of suffering will not bring itself to an end.

V. The Perils of This Shore and Wrong Views

V.1 The Fearful “This Shore” of Clinging to the Body as Truly Existing

In describing the dangers within the flow of birth and death, it is said that “this shore” is terrifying because beings cling to the body as truly existing. When a person grasps this body as an absolutely real and unshakable “I,” he thereby constructs a fearful “this shore” out of such attachment. This view prevents one from going beyond fear and attachment to the body, and becomes the root of the panic and unease that pervade this shore of samsaric birth and death.

V.2 The View of Seven Eternal Entities and the Denial of Karmic Results

Among wrong views there is also the notion that “seven bodies are permanent.” This view maintains that earth, water, fire, wind, pain, pleasure, and life—these seven “bodies”—are permanent and unchanging, and asserts that they are neither produced nor transformed, and are not constituted by any causes and conditions. It further claims that these seven each have no influence on the others, but exist independently, unrelated to one another. From this perspective, life is believed to revolve within a fixed pattern without true alteration or change. On this basis, it further denies the impact of practice on karmic result, asserting that no matter how one acts, one cannot alter the outcome that life receives. Such a view not only distorts the causal relationship governing life and the world, but also blocks the possibility of transforming one’s destiny and escaping samsara through practice.

VI. Fundamental Questions About the World and Matters Left Unanswered

VI.1 Questions About Whether the World Is Permanent or Impermanent, Finite or Infinite

Among the many questions concerning the fundamental nature of the world, certain ones are clearly designated as not to be answered or recorded. These include: “Is the world eternal?” “Is the world lasting and unchanging?” “Is the world impermanent?” “Is the world bounded?” “Is the world limited and finite?” “Is the world boundless?” “Is the world unlimited and infinite?” From the standpoints of permanence and impermanence, finitude and infinity, boundedness and boundlessness, these questions try to define conceptually the ultimate state of the world.

VI.2 The Range of Issues Left Unanswered and Unspecified

However, all these questions—whether “the world is eternal or lasting and unchanging,” “the world is impermanent,” “the world is limited and bounded,” or “the world is unlimited and boundless”—are placed within the category of matters not to be answered and not to be set forth. One is not encouraged to make either affirmative or negative assertions about them, nor are they treated as subjects to be established or expounded in detail within the teaching. Instead, they are put aside, in order to avoid being caught in such abstract debates.

VII. The Arising of the Tathāgata, Light, and Darkness

VII.1 The Gloom and Darkness Before the Tathāgata’s Arising

Before the Tathāgata appears in the world, the situation is depicted thus: great light and great radiance have not yet manifested; everything remains in darkness and gloom. At that time, the teaching of the Four Noble Truths has not yet been established; the Four Noble Truths have not been explained, designated, established, expounded, analyzed, or made clear. People lack correct understanding of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path; there is no systematic Dharma to guide them to see the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to that cessation. Thus they grope about as if in darkness.

VII.2 The Manifestation of Light After the Tathāgata’s Arising

After the Tathāgata appears, a great transformation takes place. Great light and great radiance are manifested; the former darkness and gloom are dispelled. The teaching of the Four Noble Truths is then established, and each truth is explained, designated, established, expounded, analyzed, and made clear. The reality of suffering, the cause that brings it about, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to cessation are all clearly presented in the Tathāgata’s teaching, becoming a great light that dispels the darkness of life, by which beings may practice and seek liberation.

VII.3 The Contrast Between Worldly Darkness and the Darkness of Life

In contrasting light and darkness, two kinds of darkness are mentioned. First, there is an immeasurable worldly darkness that even the mighty light of sun and moon cannot illumine. This darkness stretches without limit, beyond the reach of the strongest sunlight and moonlight. Yet beyond this there is an even greater and more fearsome darkness: the darkness of life. This darkness is not mere external dimness of space, but the deep gloom created by inner ignorance and delusion, which is far more terrifying.

VIII. The Rarity of Human Birth and the Difficulty of Escape from the Woeful Realms

VIII.1 The Rare Parable of the Blind Turtle and the Yoke with a Hole

To convey how hard it is to obtain a human body, a particularly vivid simile is used. The chance of gaining human birth is said to be even more difficult than the following scenario: There is a blind turtle, and on the vast ocean there floats a wooden yoke with a single hole in it. This blind turtle surfaces only once every hundred years. For that blind turtle, at the moment when it surfaces, to happen to put its head through the hole in that yoke is already extremely unlikely. Yet the opportunity to obtain a human body is said to be even more difficult and rarer than this. This highlights the extremely low probability of human birth and its status as a rare and precious condition.

VIII.2 The Difficulty of Regaining Human Birth After Falling into the Woeful Realms

For the foolish, once through their actions and mental states they have fallen into the woeful destinies, it is said to be exceedingly slow and difficult for them ever again to obtain human birth. That is, once a human body is lost, the time and conditions required to return to the human realm become remote and arduous; it is not something easily regained. This shows that human birth is not only inherently hard to obtain, but once lost, to recover it is even more uncertain and remote.

IX. Summary of the World’s Boundary and the Direction of Liberation

IX.1 The End of the World Cannot Be Reached by Physical Traces

In summary, the ultimate limit of the world is not a place that can be reached through bodily deeds and physical traces. One cannot expect that by traveling to some edge of the world one will thereby know the end of the world. The boundary of the world is described as a state where there is no arising, no decay, no death, and no renewed arising, and it is located within this very body of a fathom’s length—about the height of a person—endowed with thought and consciousness. Therefore, true realization of the world’s boundary and the world’s end is not obtained by seeking outward, but is closely bound up with inner awareness of body and mind and with liberation.

IX.2 Pointing Toward Liberation Amid Samsara and Darkness

Until liberation is realized, from beginningless time beings in samsara have been ceaselessly oppressed by manifold sufferings whose origin cannot be known; aging and death press in like vast mountains in empty space from the four sides; all armies, spells, and wealth are powerless to resist; all heavenly realms remain within the bonds of craving and under the sway of Māra; wrong views and attachment to the body as truly existing constitute a fearful “this shore”; and the various questions as to whether “the world is eternal or impermanent, bounded or boundless” are set aside as matters not to be answered or discussed. Only by practicing in accordance with the true Dharma, following those wise ones who have completed the pure brahma-faring, whose hearts are tranquil and whose defilements have ceased—only by thus penetrating the boundary of the world, having no further seeking regarding this life or a future life, and transcending all realms of the form and formless spheres—can one step out from this beginningless and boundless darkness of samsara and arrive at the state where suffering is brought to an end.
