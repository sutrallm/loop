I. The Fundamental Spirit of Practice and Meditation  

I.1 The Practitioner’s Way of Life and Inner State  

The fundamental principles of practice are first manifested in the practitioner’s way of life and inner qualities. A practitioner should live in seclusion, far from noise, and sit quietly in a peaceful place to cultivate, allowing body and mind to withdraw from external disturbances and thus lay the foundation for the path of deep meditation. In such practice, he must maintain inner stillness, not letting scattered thoughts and defiled emotions dominate him, and gradually penetrate into the profound realms of meditative absorption.

When meditative concentration is accomplished, the practitioner gains liberation of consciousness. His mind becomes wholesome and gentle, no longer clinging to any experience. The excellence of this consciousness is characterized by non‑clinging at its core: he reaches a state of incomparable freedom free from attachment. As right mindfulness and wholesome mental qualities mature fully, the mind can rest in stillness, no longer pulled by external conditions, and both within and without there is stability and peace.

The inner qualities of the liberated one are the complete expression of such practice. When he reflects meditatively, the mind naturally returns to stillness, no longer stirred by defilements, and abides joyfully on the path of awakening (bodhi). Both body and mind obtain stability and liberation: the body is no longer bound by coarse defilements, the inner mind is no longer dragged by greed, anger, and delusion, and he manifests a state of peaceful, joyful abiding in stillness.

I.2 The Inner Fire and the Attitude in Teaching Others  

In the course of practice, the scriptures use “inner fire” as a metaphor for a power in which diligence and stillness advance together. A practitioner says that he extinguishes the many external “fires” of worldly affairs and lights the fire of practice in his heart, dwelling based on the constant fire of cultivation and the constant stillness. The mind becomes an altar that offers to this inner sacrificial fire; at this hearth he tames and disciplines himself with wholesome qualities, thereby becoming truly a “fire among humans”: inwardly his zeal is unceasing, outwardly he remains calm and silent.

At the same time, a genuine teacher who guides beings must maintain just such a stable inner state while teaching. In the process of instruction, his mind remains always calm and peaceful, not affected by external praise or blame, favorable or adverse conditions. He also avoids any attachment to the objects of his teaching, to the results of teaching, or to his own role. This un‑clinging and unshaken attitude in teaching allows him to guide beings with a pure mind, without being entangled in human affairs and thereby losing his original intention.

I.3 Silence and Seeing Things as They Really Are  

Practice also emphasizes the spirit of “quiet silence” and “holy silence.” “Quiet silence” refers to a way of practice in which one abides in stillness, refrains from idle talk, and does not seek external connections. One should cultivate quiet silence: within it the practitioner contemplates body and mind and all phenomena, directly knowing their true characteristics, and is no longer deceived by deluded discriminations.

There is also the state called “holy silence,” which is to abide in inner stillness free of discursive thought and evaluation (free from “applied and sustained thought”), focusing the mind on a single object without distraction, thereby dwelling in the second meditative absorption. When cultivating this holy silence, the practitioner must carefully protect mindfulness and not be heedless. After entering the joyful concentration of no applied and sustained thought, he must continue to be attentive, allowing the mind to remain exclusively in the pure, silent stillness of the second jhāna.

In the teachings on cultivating concentration to attain direct seeing of reality, it is explicitly stated that one should continuously cultivate and increase meditative concentration so that the mind becomes increasingly stable. Only a person whose mind is stable can truly and reliably know the nature of things and give rise to seeing things as they really are. Such seeing means to clearly and directly recognize that all phenomena are impermanent, and thus no longer give rise to the erroneous view of permanence with regard to conditioned processes, thereby laying a firm foundation of wisdom for further liberation.

II. The Overall Structure of Meditative Concentration and the Realms of Liberation  

II.1 General Explanation of the Seven Realms and the Nine Progressive Attainments  

Within the system of meditation and liberation there exist multiple levels of realms, each with corresponding methods of cultivation and realization. For example, when speaking of the “seven realms,” it is said that different realms must be reached through different methods of focused attention. The realms of light, purity, the sphere of infinite space, the sphere of infinite consciousness, and the sphere of nothingness can be entered by relying on “attainments based on perception”; the sphere of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception is realized by relying on the “attainment with residual formations”; and as for the realm of cessation of perception and feeling, it can only be reached by relying on the “attainment of cessation.” This shows that each level of realm has its own specific meditative method and entryway.

On the other hand, meditative concentration is systematically organized as the “nine progressive attainments.” These consist first of the four form‑realm concentrations, that is, the four jhānas or four meditative absorptions; next, the four formless‑realm concentrations; and finally the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. The progression of the nine attainments presents a path from coarse to subtle: from having applied and sustained thought to being without them, and from having perception and feeling to the complete cessation of perception and feeling.

In the four form‑realm jhānas, the first jhāna is separation from sensual desire and unwholesome states, with applied and sustained thought, and it abides in joy and happiness born of seclusion. The second jhāna is where applied and sustained thought fall still; the mind becomes silent, focused on one object, without applied or sustained thought, and abides in joy and happiness born of concentration. The third jhāna is the abandoning of joy to establish equanimity, dwelling in right mindfulness and right awareness, feeling happiness with the body, and abiding in the happiness of mindful equanimity. The fourth jhāna abandons both happiness and suffering, extinguishes pleasure and distress, and abides in a state that is neither painful nor pleasant, where mindfulness of equanimity is completely pure. These four form‑realm concentrations correspond to the teachings on the four jhānas and form an extremely important inner ladder in practice.

The four formless concentrations then advance beyond this. The sphere of infinite space is the transcendence of all notions of material form and the complete ending of obstructive conceptions; one no longer thinks in terms of changeable worldly objects but abides in a realm of boundless space. The sphere of infinite consciousness transcends the sphere of infinite space and abides in boundless consciousness. The sphere of nothingness transcends the sphere of infinite consciousness and abides in the realm of “nothing at all.” The sphere of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception then transcends the sphere of nothingness and abides in an extremely subtle state in which there is neither clear perception nor total non‑perception. As for the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, it transcends even the sphere of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception and abides in the silent concentration in which perception and feeling are completely terminated.

II.2 Meditative Concentration, Pleasant Abiding in This Very Life, Wisdom, and the Standard of a Good Person  

Through accomplishment of the four jhānas, the four formless concentrations, and the cessation of perception and feeling, a practitioner can obtain the state of “pleasant abiding in this very life.” When he gains the superior mental states of these four concentrations, he can abide in happiness in this very lifetime, acting freely in accord with his right mindfulness and right understanding, no longer bound by difficulties and afflictions. This pleasant abiding here and now is not heedless indulgence, but a pure happiness that flows naturally from meditative concentration and shines together with supramundane wisdom.

In the practical sequence of training, especially in the aspect of meditative realization, it is emphasized that one must first separate from sensual desire and unwholesome states, possess applied and sustained thought, and realize joy and happiness, and then gradually accomplish the nine progressive attainments. The correct goal of practice is to apply oneself diligently and abide in meditative concentration, and on the basis of this concentration give rise to excellent wisdom and insight. Only one who delights in extinguishing all defilements and attachments truly deserves the name “good person.” This “delight in extinction” is not forced renunciation, but a heartfelt joy in the eradication of greed, anger, and delusion and in the letting go of all clinging, taking that extinction itself as happiness.

III. Detailed Explanation and Practice of the Four Jhānas / Four Meditative Absorptions  

III.1 The Nature of the First Jhāna and Key Points of Its Practice  

The first jhāna is the first stage in the entire system of meditative concentration and fully corresponds to the teaching on the “first meditative absorption.” It is defined as follows: having separated from various sensual desires and unwholesome states, the mind still possesses the mental activities of search and examination, that is, applied and sustained thought, and abides in joy and happiness born of seclusion. When entering the first jhāna, the practitioner bases himself on separation from desires and unwholesome states; through this separation, joy and happiness naturally arise, and he thus enters and abides in the first jhāna.

At this stage, the first jhāna is also the realm in which verbal action ceases and lightness is obtained. Upon reaching the first jhāna, speech begins to cease, verbal formations end, and verbal activity attains ease. In the sequence of the cessation and ending of formations, the first jhāna is described as the place where verbal action ceases and is stilled, and where verbal activity attains lightness. Because of the joy and happiness born of seclusion, bodily and mental lightness arises, and the practitioner, with a more supple and clear mind, can further continue to realize deeper states of concentration.

As part of the practice related to the “faculty of concentration,” the first absorption is also used to investigate this faculty. The noble disciple, taking equanimity as the object, gains concentration and unification of mind; in concrete terms, this means separating from desires and unwholesome states, with applied and sustained thought, and fully attaining the first absorption. At this time, the practitioner should not be heedless, but should let the mind rest, be unified and steadily maintained in the realm of the first jhāna, allowing the mind to stay for a long time in the concentration of joy and happiness born of seclusion. When cultivating the five faculties, the cultivation of the faculty of concentration also relies on seclusion, on separation from craving, and on extinction, and dedicates all that is cultivated toward equanimity. Thus, even in the abiding of the first jhāna there is already an implicit trend toward equanimity and toward nirvāṇa.

From the perspective of the five faculties, the faculty of pain is said to be completely extinguished in the first absorption. In other words, when the practitioner abides in the first absorption of joy and happiness born of seclusion, the coarse painful sensations in body and mind can be fully extinguished here, paving the way for more refined happiness and equanimity.

III.2 The Second Jhāna and the State of Holy Silence  

The basic definition of the second jhāna is that, with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought, the inner mind reaches stillness; it is focused on a single state and abides in a samādhi without applied or sustained thought, possessing joy and happiness born of concentration. That is, it is a deepening from the state of applied and sustained thought in the first jhāna: with the ceasing of applied and sustained thought the inner mind becomes tranquil and pure, the mind reaches one‑pointedness, without applied or sustained thought, and from the concentration itself joy and happiness arise.

In the second jhāna, the practitioner’s inner mind is quiet and steady, focused on a single object; the joy and happiness that arise are entirely dependent on concentration. This inner state free from the interference of applied and sustained thought is also called “holy silence.” Holy silence has several key features: discursive thought and evaluation are abandoned; inner stillness is attained; the mind is kept focused on a single object; and one abides in the realm of the second jhāna. When the practitioner enters the concentration of no applied and sustained thought and joy arises, he truly abides in the second jhāna and maintains the state of holy silence.

In the process of realizing the second jhāna, the practitioner attains inner stillness and one‑pointedness by subduing applied and sustained thought, and on this basis enters and abides in the second jhāna. However, even while abiding in this state, thoughts and mental orientations related to applied thought may still occasionally arise and must be especially guarded against with mindfulness and diligence. The guiding principle for cultivating the second jhāna is that one should not be heedless, but should focus the mind and let it rest in the second jhāna, continually maintaining it in that state. In the teachings on the cessation and lightness of formations, the second jhāna is also described as the place where applied and sustained thought come to rest and become light: upon attaining the second jhāna, applied and sustained thought cease and become light; their formations end and their lightness is accomplished.

From the perspective of the five faculties, the faculty of sorrow is said to be completely extinguished in the second absorption (the realm of joy and happiness born of concentration). When the practitioner abides in the joy and happiness born of concentration, inner sorrow does not arise, thus preparing for a still deeper equanimity.

III.3 The Equanimous Mind and Right Mindfulness and Clear Knowing of the Third Jhāna  

The realm of the third jhāna is founded upon the joy and happiness of the first two jhānas, and then further abandons joy in order to abide in equanimity. Its definition is: having withdrawn from joy, one possesses equanimity, right mindfulness, and clear knowing, and feels happiness with the body. The noble ones call this “equanimous, mindful, happily abiding.” At this time, the practitioner no longer clings to the excited state of joy, but calmly abides in tranquil equanimity while still clearly experiencing happiness through the body.

The mental characteristics of the third jhāna can be summarized in three points. First is equanimity: the mind is balanced and free of partiality, not rising and falling along with external conditions. Second is mindfulness: one continuously maintains right mindfulness, neither dull nor scattered. Third is happy abiding: although joy has been relinquished, one still abides in a refined bodily and mental happiness. In practice, the foundation for cultivating the third jhāna is the relinquishment of joy, giving up the joyful feeling while maintaining balanced equanimity, and at the same time maintaining right mindfulness and clear knowing, using wisdom and awareness to illuminate body and mind.

In concrete practice, the practitioner should feel happiness with the body, placing attention upon the happiness experienced by the body, allowing the mind to stand firm in the third jhāna. He lets the mind rest in this realm, focusing it exclusively on the third jhāna without allowing it to scatter or fall back. Special care must be taken not to be heedless in the third jhāna, not to slacken or lose mindfulness. The correct way to maintain it is that the mind continuously abides in the third jhāna, unceasingly maintaining right mindfulness and clear knowing, so that this state of equanimous, happy abiding becomes firm and luminous.

In the sequence of the lightness of formations, the third jhāna is said to be the place where joy grows light; upon reaching the third jhāna, joy ceases and becomes light, the formation of joy ends, and joy obtains lightness. From the teaching of the five faculties, the faculty of pleasure is completely extinguished in the third absorption (the realm of happiness beyond joy). This means that even though the body and mind still experience happiness, the root clinging to “pleasure” that binds one is totally quenched here.

III.4 The Purity of Equanimous Mindfulness and Neither‑Pleasant‑nor‑Painful Feeling in the Fourth Jhāna  

The realm of the fourth jhāna is the summit of all form‑realm concentration and is the state in which equanimity and mindfulness are completely pure. The fourth jhāna is described as follows: one abandons the feelings of pleasure and pain; happiness and sorrow have already been extinguished; one resides in a state that is neither painful nor pleasant and abides in the purity of equanimous mindfulness. That is, the practitioner has cut off happiness and suffering, extinguished the joy and sorrow that previously existed, and even extinguished the joy and attachment that had been present before, reaching a state that is beyond pleasure and pain, possessing purity of equanimity and mindfulness and abiding therein.

In the teachings on the cessation and ending of formations, the fourth jhāna is called the place where in‑breath and out‑breath cease. Upon reaching the fourth jhāna, inhalation and exhalation come to rest and become light, and the formation of breathing attains lightness. At the same time, in the levels of lightening of formations, the fourth jhāna is precisely the realm of the lightness of in‑breath and out‑breath. In the context of the five faculties, the faculty of joy is completely extinguished in the fourth absorption (the purity of equanimous mindfulness). That is, even the subtle clinging to joy is entirely quenched here.

The key point in practicing the fourth jhāna is the settling of the mind. The practitioner must not be heedless with respect to the fourth jhāna; he should let the mind rest, be unified and maintained in the fourth jhāna so that the purity of equanimity and mindfulness is consolidated and does not regress. From the concrete practice of the faculty of concentration, cutting off happiness and pain, as well as the already‑extinguished sorrow and joy, and fully attaining the fourth absorption of pure equanimous mindfulness, is part of the maturation of the concentration faculty. From the standpoint of the complete extinction of the five faculties, the faculty of equanimity ultimately becomes completely extinguished only in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, while the fourth jhāna is the decisive stage in which the faculty of joy is utterly purified and removed.

III.5 The Four Jhānas / Four Absorptions and Their Orientation Toward Nirvāṇa  

In the teaching on the four jhānas, which are identical with the four meditative absorptions, the first absorption is separation from all sensual desires and unwholesome states, possessing the mental activities of search and examination, and abiding in joy and happiness born of seclusion. The second absorption is when search and examination have ceased; the inner mind is pure; the mind is focused on one object; one abides in samādhi without search or examination and gives rise to joy and happiness. The third absorption is when joy has been abandoned and one abides in tranquility, maintaining right mindfulness and clear knowing; the body experiences happiness, as declared by the noble ones—this is an equanimous, mindful, happily abiding state. The fourth absorption is when happiness and pain have been cut off; the joy and attachment that formerly existed have been extinguished; one reaches a state of neither‑pleasure‑nor‑pain and possesses purity of equanimous mindfulness, abiding therein.

The teaching explicitly states that cultivating and repeatedly cultivating these four absorptions causes one to incline toward nirvāṇa, tend toward nirvāṇa, and ultimately reach nirvāṇa. In order to rightly know, fully understand, and utterly eradicate and cut off the five higher fetters—attachment to the form realm, attachment to the formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance—one should cultivate these four absorptions. The four absorptions are not only pleasant abidings, but also the fundamental path for cutting off the higher fetters and moving toward nirvāṇa.

IV. The Sequence and Practice of the Formless Concentrations and the Attainment of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling  

IV.1 The Transcending Sequence of the Four Formless‑Realm Concentrations  

When the four jhānas have been fully mastered, the practitioner can further cultivate the four formless‑realm concentrations in order to transcend the limitations of the material body and physical form. The defining feature of the concentration of the sphere of infinite space is that it transcends all concepts of matter and all perceptions of form, bringing obstructive ideas to an end; one no longer thinks in terms of changeable phenomena, but abides in a realm of boundless space. In this concentration, the practitioner lets consciousness rest in the meditative state of boundless empty space, surpassing perception of material form, eliminating dualistic mental attitudes, stopping mental discrimination about phenomena, and practicing non‑clinging and non‑grasping. This is precisely the implementation of the core training principle of “letting the mind abide free from appearances.”

The concentration of the sphere of infinite consciousness then transcends the sphere of infinite space and abides in a realm of infinite consciousness, where the mind recognizes “consciousness is boundless” and does not remain only at “space is boundless.” The concentration of the sphere of nothingness goes further, transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness and abiding in the realm of “nothing whatsoever,” no longer clinging to any duality of “having” or “not having.” The concentration of the sphere of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception then further transcends the sphere of nothingness and abides in an extremely subtle state that is neither clear perception nor complete non‑perception, far removed from all coarse mental activities of conceptualization.

In the methods for realizing the seven realms, the realms of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness can all be reached by relying on “attainments based on perception,” whereas the realm of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception must be realized by relying on the “attainment with residual formations.” Concerning the sphere of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception, the teaching especially points out that the practitioner should not be heedless: he should let the mind rest, be unified, and maintained in this concentration, ensuring that this most subtle state of absorption is not destroyed by distraction.

IV.2 Entry, Abiding, and Emergence in the Attainment of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling  

After transcending the four formless concentrations, the highest state of concentration is the “attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling,” wherein perception and feeling are completely extinguished. In the nine progressive attainments and in the sequence of the cessation of formations, this attainment represents the thorough stopping of all mental activities. From the standpoint of the cessation of formations, when one reaches the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling cease. In terms of the stilling of formations, this attainment is where perception and feeling come to rest; and at the level of the lightness of formations, it is the realm in which perception and feeling attain lightness.

When cultivating the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, the process of entering it has a distinctive mental characteristic. When the practitioner reaches this attainment, there does not arise in his mind the thought, “I am about to attain it,” “I am attaining it,” or “I have attained it”; rather, because of the force of his previously long‑cultivated habit and training, he naturally moves into this state. While he abides in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, the order of cessation appears in sequence: first verbal formations cease, next bodily formations cease, and then mental formations cease. The activities of body, speech, and mind come to rest one after another, and he enters extremely deep quiescence.

When comparing the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling with death, one can see both similarities and differences. The similarity lies in that in both cases bodily formations, verbal formations, and mental formations all cease and become light. The difference is that, in the case of death, a person’s life‑span is exhausted, bodily warmth has gone out, and the sense faculties have decayed; whereas for the practitioner abiding in the cessation of perception and feeling, life‑span is not exhausted, bodily warmth has not gone out, and the faculties remain pure. It is only that bodily and mental activity is completely stilled, while the potential for life and functioning is still present.

From the perspective of emergence from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, when the practitioner rises from this attainment, likewise there does not arise in his mind the thought, “I am about to emerge,” “I am emerging,” or “I have emerged”; instead, because of the prior power of training, he naturally moves toward emergence. The order of arising at emergence also has a sequence: first mental formations arise, then bodily formations arise, and finally verbal formations arise. The mind awakens first, and then bodily and verbal functions gradually recover.

After emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, the practitioner comes into contact with three kinds of contacts: contact with emptiness, contact with the signless, and contact with the wishless. These three contacts correspond to the three gateways to liberation—emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness—and they indicate that after emerging from concentration his mind still corresponds to the liberating Dharma and does not immediately fall back into the coarse, scattered worldly state. At this time his mind inclines toward seclusion, tends toward seclusion, and moves toward seclusion; all mental activity is directed toward disconnection, freedom from stains, and nirvāṇa. The attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling is said to have two great benefits: “calm” and “insight.” In the depth of extreme stillness, the power of calm (śamatha) is fully matured; after emerging, with a pure and undefiled mind he can observe the impermanence, suffering, and non‑self of all phenomena. This is the highest level of united calm and insight.

In the teaching of the five faculties, the faculty of equanimity is ultimately completely extinguished in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. That is, even the subtle clinging to equanimity itself is fully stilled there. This shows that this attainment not only extinguishes all bodily and mental feeling and perception, but is also the final key to fully gathering and turning the five faculties toward nirvāṇa.

V. The Stilling of Formations, Their Lightness, and the Nine Levels that Transcend Worldly Sensual Pleasures  

V.1 The Sequence of the Cessation and Stilling of Formations  

In the sequence of meditative cultivation, various formations gradually cease and become still as concentration deepens. From the perspective of the cessation of formations: in the first jhāna, verbal activity ceases; in the second jhāna, applied and sustained thought cease; in the third jhāna, joy ceases; in the fourth jhāna, in‑breath and out‑breath cease. Going further, in the sphere of infinite space, perception of form ceases; in the sphere of infinite consciousness, perception of the sphere of infinite space ceases; in the sphere of nothingness, perception of the sphere of infinite consciousness ceases; in the sphere of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception, perception of the sphere of nothingness ceases; and in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling cease. Finally, in the state of exhaustion of the outflows (complete liberation), greed, hatred, and delusion cease, and all defiled formations are utterly extinguished.

From the standpoint of the stilling of formations: in the first jhāna, verbal activity is stilled; in the second jhāna, applied and sustained thought are stilled; in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling are stilled; and in the exhaustion of the outflows, greed, hatred, and delusion are stilled. This shows that meditative concentration is not merely a pleasant experience but actually causes the three kinds of karma—of body, speech, and mind—to become progressively quiet and still, allowing the mind to move away from clinging and fabrication, gradually tending toward purity and liberation.

V.2 The Lightness of Formations and Their Changes in the Sequence of Meditation  

The lightness of formations also grows progressively as meditation deepens. In the first jhāna, verbal activity becomes light; in the second jhāna, applied and sustained thought become light; in the third jhāna, joy becomes light; in the fourth jhāna, in‑breath and out‑breath become light; in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling become light; and in the exhaustion of the outflows, greed, hatred, and delusion become light. This indicates that as practice progresses, various behaviors and mental activities not only stop but, after stopping, bring an experience of bodily and mental lightness.

In a section that discusses the transformation of formations in the progression of meditation, this gradual stilling and lightening is also organized into a clear path: upon reaching the first jhāna, verbal activity is stilled and becomes light; upon reaching the second jhāna, applied and sustained thought are stilled and made light; upon reaching the third jhāna, joy is stilled and made light; upon reaching the fourth jhāna, in‑breath and out‑breath are stilled and made light; upon reaching the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling are stilled and made light; and in the case of a monk who has exhausted the outflows, greed, hatred, and delusion are stilled and become light. Through such descriptions we can clearly see that practice is not simply a matter of “attaining certain states,” but a process in which the formations of body, speech, and mind are progressively purified and lightened at a deep level.

V.3 The Nine Levels that Transcend Worldly Sensual Pleasures and the Threefold Classification of Joy, Happiness, and Equanimity  

In the system of practice that transcends worldly sensual pleasures, the scriptures speak of nine levels and categorize joy, happiness, and equanimity into three levels each. Concerning the levels of “joy”: the first is the joy with sustenance, that is, joy that arises dependent on the five sensual pleasures; the second is joy without sustenance, meaning the joy that arises through the first and second jhānas; the third is joy with even less sustenance, which is the joy that arises when one contemplates the mind liberated from greed, hatred, and delusion. Concerning “happiness,” there is a similar threefold division: happiness with sustenance is the happiness arising from the five sensual pleasures; happiness without sustenance is the happiness that arises through the first to the third jhānas; and happiness with even less sustenance is the happiness that arises when one contemplates the mind freed from greed, hatred, and delusion. As for “equanimity,” it is likewise divided into three: equanimity with sustenance is equanimity related to the five sensual pleasures; equanimity without sustenance is the equanimity that arises through the fourth jhāna; and equanimity with even less sustenance is the equanimity that arises when one contemplates the mind liberated from greed, hatred, and delusion.

In the explanation of the “happiness of the first jhāna,” the scriptures state that the happiness of the first jhāna is joy and happiness born of seclusion, with applied and sustained thought, through separation from desires and unwholesome states. The happiness of the second jhāna is joy and happiness born of concentration, after applied and sustained thought have fallen still, with inner tranquility, focus on one object, and the absence of applied and sustained thought. The happiness of the third jhāna is that, with the abandoning of joy, one possesses equanimity, right mindfulness and clear knowing, and feels happiness with the body; the noble ones call this equanimous, happily abiding. The happiness of the fourth jhāna is that one relinquishes the previous happiness and suffering, extinguishes joy and sorrow, abides in a state that is neither painful nor pleasant, and possesses pure equanimity and mindfulness. These nine levels of joy, happiness, and equanimity clearly show a gradual path from the coarsest sensual pleasures to the three feelings of joy, happiness, and equanimity that arise from contemplating the liberated mind, a path that moves from the worldly to the supramundane and from clinging to purity.

In concrete cultivation, there is also a frequently cited sequence of mental development: from confidence comes joy; from joy comes rapture; from rapture the body becomes light and at ease; from lightness one experiences happiness; and because of happiness the mind enters concentration. This sequence shows that when a practitioner develops firm faith in the true Dharma, joy first arises in the heart; from joy comes deeper rapture; rapture brings bodily and mental lightness; lightness further brings stable happiness; and in this happiness the mind naturally enters meditative absorption.

VI. The Faculty of Concentration and the Role of Meditation within the Five Faculties  

VI.1 Definition and Practice of the Faculty of Concentration  

Within the teaching of the five faculties, the faculty of concentration is extremely important. Its basic definition is that, taking equanimity as the object, one gains concentration and unification of mind. That is, the noble disciple takes equanimity as the object of mindfulness, letting the mind rest and be focused upon equanimity, and thereby obtains stable concentration and one‑pointedness. In concrete practice, cultivation of the faculty of concentration is accomplished through the four absorptions: separating from desires and unwholesome states, with applied and sustained thought, fully attaining the first absorption; applied and sustained thought become still, leading to inner purity and one‑pointedness of mind, without applied and sustained thought, fully attaining the second absorption; abandoning joy, abiding in equanimity, experiencing happiness associated with right mindfulness and clear knowing, fully attaining the third absorption; and cutting off happiness and suffering, as well as the previously extinguished sorrow and joy, fully attaining the fourth absorption of pure equanimous mindfulness.

In the core principles for cultivating the five faculties, it is stated that cultivation must rely on seclusion, on separation from craving, and on extinction, and that everything cultivated should be dedicated toward equanimity. That is, the cultivation of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom should all stand upon the basis of separation from attachment and a direction toward extinction, taking equanimity as the final destination. When these practices are explained in detail, the teaching further states that based on seclusion one can elaborate all aspects related to the faculties, showing that seclusion is the common foundation for cultivating all five faculties. In actual contemplative practice, the scriptures explicitly state that one should investigate the faculty of concentration within the four absorptions—that is, by observing one’s own concentration and equanimity within the four jhānas in order to cultivate and mature the concentration faculty.

VI.2 The Places where Each Faculty Is Completely Extinguished and the Mind’s Orientation Toward Nirvāṇa  

In the teaching on the cessation of the five faculties and the mind’s orientation toward nirvāṇa, the scriptures detail the stage at which each faculty is completely extinguished. The faculty of pain is entirely extinguished in the first absorption (joy and happiness born of seclusion); the faculty of sorrow is entirely extinguished in the second absorption (joy and happiness born of concentration); the faculty of pleasure is entirely extinguished in the third absorption (refined happiness beyond joy); the faculty of joy is entirely extinguished in the fourth absorption (purity of equanimous mindfulness); and the faculty of equanimity is entirely extinguished in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. Through this sequence we can see how the five faculties are transformed and brought to cessation in different stages of meditative concentration, all ultimately tending toward nirvāṇa and complete liberation. When the practitioner contemplates the arising and cessation of these faculties within the various jhānas, basing himself on seclusion and extinction, he allows his mind to gradually distance itself from defilements and clinging and naturally incline toward nirvāṇa.

VII. Methods of Meditative Practice: Mindfulness, Radiant Perception, and the Unification of Body and Mind  

VII.1 The Attitude of Uniform Practice Before and After, Day and Night  

In the correct methods of practice, the scriptures present several key approaches. The first is “abiding with thoughts on before and after,” meaning that the practitioner must be skilled in holding, directing, and examining what is taken as object and what is thought of before and after, and skilful in understanding them with wisdom, so that what comes later is like what came before, and what came before is like what comes later, with mental activity remaining consistent and non‑contradictory over time. This attitude prevents deviations or back‑and‑forth swings between earlier and later stages of practice, allowing mental activity to advance steadily.

The second is “abiding with thoughts by day and night,” emphasizing that daytime practice and nighttime practice should have the same characteristics, features, and causal conditions—night like day, day like night. That is, the practitioner should not apply effort only at a particular time, but should maintain the same mindfulness and concentration throughout both day and night so that practice becomes a continuous and unbroken way of life.

VII.2 Vast Radiant Mind and the Perceptions of Happiness and Lightness  

The third method is to cultivate the “vast radiant mind.” The practitioner should skillfully maintain the perception of light, skillfully hold to this perception, and cultivate a vast, unconfined mind, developing a radiant mind. Such practice not only frees the mind from darkness and dullness but also fosters breadth and clarity, opening space for more delicate insight and deeper concentration.

In the fundamental principle of unifying body and mind, the teaching also mentions that the practitioner may abide in particular perceptions to foster unity and stillness of body and mind. Especially recommended are abiding in the perception of happiness and abiding in the perception of lightness, allowing the body to feel softness and ease while the mind stays stable in an impression of happiness. In this way, body and mind correspond to each other and jointly move toward absorption.

VII.3 The Four Establishments of Mindfulness and the Cessation of Bodily Pain  

Although practice of the four establishments of mindfulness—mindfulness of body, feeling, mind, and phenomena—focuses primarily on contemplative observation, it also profoundly transforms the physical and mental states. In the results of cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness, the scriptures state that a practitioner who has become skilled in them can, with respect to painful bodily feelings already arisen, cause them to completely cease in the mind so that they do not continue. This shows that by mindfully observing painful bodily feelings, one does not suppress or avoid them but, through wisdom, sees clearly their true nature; thereby the opportunities for clinging and proliferation are cut off, and painful feeling naturally ceases completely in the mind.

VII.4 Mindfulness of In‑ and Out‑Breathing as the Foundation of Meditation  

In the cultivation of meditative concentration, mindfulness of in‑ and out‑breathing plays an extremely crucial role. Practicing this concentration causes body and eyes not to become weary and enables freedom from all grasping, liberating the mind from all defilements. Here the emphasis is that by resting right mindfulness upon the breath, one not only soothes and restores the body and sense faculties but also allows the practitioner to gradually release clinging to internal and external objects, turning the mind toward liberation.

More importantly, mindfulness of breathing is clearly stated to be the fundamental method for entering and abiding in all meditative states. By resting upon the breath, the practitioner may enter the first jhāna: separating from desires and unwholesome states, accompanied by applied and sustained thought, and experiencing joy and happiness born of seclusion. He may enter the second jhāna: applied and sustained thought are calmed, the inner mind is pure and unified, accompanied by joy and happiness born of concentration. He may enter the third jhāna: joy has been relinquished, accompanied by tranquility, right mindfulness, and clear knowing, and the body experiences the happiness declared by the noble ones. He may enter the fourth jhāna: happiness and pain have been cut off, previous sorrow and joy have been extinguished, and he reaches the state that is neither painful nor pleasant, with complete purity of mindfulness and equanimity.

At the same time, mindfulness of breathing is also the basis for entering the higher meditative states of the sphere of infinite space, the sphere of infinite consciousness, the sphere of nothingness, the sphere of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception, and the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. Through deep focus on and letting go into the breath, the practitioner gradually transcends all concepts of material form, extinguishes dualistic views, no longer directs attention toward various perceptions, and reaches the realm of the sphere of infinite space in which “space is boundless.” He further transcends this to reach the sphere of infinite consciousness in which “consciousness is boundless”; then further enters the sphere of nothingness in which “there is nothing”; then transcends that to reach the sphere of neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception; and finally transcends even this, reaching the attainment in which perception and feeling are extinguished. Thus mindfulness of breathing becomes the common root of all meditative concentrations, from the coarse to the subtle.

VIII. The Progressive Realization of Meditation and the Multiple Paths Leading to Nirvāṇa  

VIII.1 Repeated Realization of the Four Jhānas and Summary of the Nine Progressive Attainments  

In the process of realizing the stages of meditative concentration, the scriptures repeatedly restate the characteristics of the four jhānas and their place within the system of the nine progressive attainments. The first jhāna is separation from desires and unwholesome states, accompanied by applied and sustained thought, and abidance in joy and happiness born of seclusion; the practitioner, having separated from desires and unwholesome states, with applied and sustained thought, experiences joy and happiness born of seclusion and enters and abides in the first jhāna. The second jhāna is the stilling of applied and sustained thought; the inner mind inclines toward tranquility; the mind reaches one‑pointedness, without applied or sustained thought, and experiences joy and happiness born of concentration; the practitioner extinguishes applied and sustained thought, his inner mind becomes pure, one‑pointed, without applied or sustained thought, experiencing joy and happiness born of concentration, and enters and abides in the second jhāna. The third jhāna is withdrawal from joy, maintaining equanimity and clear knowing, feeling happiness with the body, and abiding in a state of equanimity, mindfulness, and happy abiding; the practitioner abandons joy and abides in equanimity, maintaining right mindfulness and clear knowing, feeling happiness with the body, and enters and abides in the third jhāna. The fourth jhāna is the relinquishment of happiness and suffering, with previous joy and sorrow extinguished, reaching a state beyond pleasure and pain, possessing equanimity and pure mindfulness, and abiding therein; the practitioner abandons happiness and suffering, extinguishes previous joy and sorrow, and enters and abides in the fourth jhāna.

These descriptions repeatedly point out the same sequence: the first jhāna is joy and happiness born of seclusion with applied and sustained thought; the second jhāna is joy and happiness born of concentration without applied and sustained thought; the third jhāna is happiness with equanimity and mindfulness beyond joy; the fourth jhāna is purity of equanimous mindfulness beyond all pleasure and pain. This corresponds to another formulation: the progressive law of the four jhānas is that the first jhāna separates from desires and unwholesome states and has applied and sustained thought, reaching joy and happiness born of seclusion; the second jhāna stills applied and sustained thought, the inner mind tends to one‑pointedness, reaching joy and happiness born of concentration; the third jhāna withdraws from joy, maintains mindfulness and awareness, and experiences the happiness of relinquishment; the fourth jhāna abandons all pleasant and painful feelings and reaches a state of complete purity and fulfilled mindfulness.

VIII.2 The Many Kinds of Samādhis that Support Meditation and the Path to Nirvāṇa  

Regarding the methods of practice that lead to nirvāṇa, the scriptures clearly state that nirvāṇa can be attained through multiple approaches and that all these approaches are valid paths. Among the methods of meditative practice, many kinds of samādhi are mentioned, including samādhi with applied and sustained thought, samādhi without applied thought but with sustained thought, samādhi without applied or sustained thought, the samādhi of emptiness, the samādhi of the signless, and the samādhi of the wishless. These samādhis correspond to different meditative states and gateways to liberation, providing practitioners with varied and flexible paths of practice.

In instructing how to use meditation to achieve direct seeing of reality, the teaching again emphasizes that one should continuously cultivate and increase meditative concentration so that the mind becomes stable. Only a mind that is stable can truly and reliably know the nature of things, and one of the core contents of seeing things as they really are is clearly recognizing that all phenomena are impermanent. When the practitioner, on the basis of meditative concentration, further develops the wisdom of insight to contemplate the impermanence, suffering, and non‑self of all phenomena, he can truly proceed toward liberation, attain the exhaustion of the outflows, and bring greed, hatred, and delusion to cessation and lightness, ultimately to their complete extinction.

Bringing all the above together, we see that from living in seclusion and sitting in quiet meditation, maintaining inner stillness, to penetrating the first, second, third, and fourth jhānas, and further to the four formless concentrations and the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling; from cultivating quiet silence and holy silence to developing the faculty of concentration and stilling the formations; from consistency before and after and continuous day‑and‑night practice, to cultivating the vast radiant mind and mindfulness of breathing—all of these serve to enable the practitioner to separate from desires and evil, extinguish defilements, give rise to joy, lightness, and concentration, and then insightfully observe the true nature of all phenomena, ultimately inclining toward, tending toward, and arriving at nirvāṇa. Such a complete and rigorous system of meditative stages and realms of liberation constitutes the full path and inner transformation for the practitioner from ordinary person to liberated one.
