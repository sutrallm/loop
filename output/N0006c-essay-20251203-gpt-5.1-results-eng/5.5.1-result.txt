I. The Fundamental Basis of Perfect Virtue and the Character of the Dharma Speaker

I.1 Fundamental Principles of Perfect Virtue  
A person endowed with such virtues as wisdom, few desires, diligence, and skill in teaching will naturally be liked and praised by those who are not foolish, not defiled, and whose minds are not scattered. Such virtues shine with a pure brilliance like a precious jewel: not only are they complete and stable in oneself, they also become a model for others to look up to and rely upon. This perfect virtue does not remain merely at the level of external behavior, but is rooted in an inner clarity of mind, fewness of desires, and unremitting diligence. From this it unfolds as unshakable confidence in the true Dharma and as the ability to skillfully guide living beings.

I.2 The Basic Attitude of Skillful Instruction  
In the process of guiding living beings, a skillful teacher must be adept in speech, able to express the meaning with appropriate language, and at the same time diligent in exhortation so that those who hear are willing to actually put the teaching into practice, rather than remaining only at the level of intellectual understanding. In addition, one must be courageous in correcting wrongdoing, so that when encountering deviations and faults one does not keep silent out of fear or a wish to ingratiate oneself, but instead points out errors and rectifies the course on the basis of integrity and compassion, helping beings to stay away from unwholesome actions and distorted views. Skill in speech, diligence in exhortation, and courage in correcting wrong together constitute the indispensable basic attitude of a fully qualified Dharma teacher in guiding others.

II. The Teaching Motives of the Liberated and of Practitioners

II.1 The Pure Motive in the Teaching of the Liberated  
The teaching of one who is truly liberated is given with the benefit of living beings as its sole support. The reason they teach is their pity and compassion for all sentient beings, not any pursuit of fame, gain, or other worldly aims. Such teaching issues from a mind that has been completely liberated from greed and hatred; therefore its motive is pure and undefiled, with no craving for offerings and praise, and no agitation from hatred or dogmatic attachment. Precisely because their heart is freed from greed and hatred, everything they say takes the genuine welfare of beings as its only consideration.

II.2 The Methods and Aim of Guiding Beings Toward Liberation  
In concrete instruction, the purpose of teaching is to guide beings to the further shore of liberation, so that they may truly free themselves from birth-and-death and from afflictions. When beings raise questions about the path to liberation, the teacher answers these doubts and clarifies the right path so that their confusion is dispelled. Since the starting point of the instruction is to lead beings onto the path of liberation and help them reach the further shore, all the content and methods of teaching revolve around helping the listeners to correctly understand and actually practice the way to liberation.

II.3 The Attitude Practitioners Should Maintain When Teaching  
For teachers who are themselves still on the path of practice, the inner attitude is likewise extremely important. A genuine practitioner should not teach for the sake of obtaining material benefits, nor take wealth, offerings, or worldly rewards as the motive for guiding others. Rather, they should abide within the true Dharma, letting their own standpoint and conduct be in complete accord with it. They take practice itself as the right course of their life, regarding it as the fundamental direction of their existence, not as something incidental or ornamental. For such a person there is no contradiction between their teaching and their life; what they say and what they do echo one another, and thus they more readily inspire faith, acceptance, and actual practice in those who listen.

III. The Instructional Ability of Teachers and Noble Ones

III.1 The Teacher’s Function in Instruction  
A truly virtuous teacher plays a crucial role in instruction. They can cause a path that has not yet arisen to arise in the hearts of the listeners, enabling those who have not yet recognized the right path to clearly understand it. Teachings that have never before been explained they can elucidate, allowing listeners to encounter Dharma meanings that were previously unknown to them. By means of this instructional function, the teacher is not merely transmitting pre‑existing knowledge, but opening up within the listener’s heart a path of practice that was not there before, so that they can further come to know, understand, and undertake it.

III.2 The Scope of Noble Ones in Instructing Beings  
Those who possess the realization of noble ones have a special breadth and depth in their teaching scope and ability. They can expound the Dharma not only to Brahmā gods, Brahmā’s ministers, and the assembly of Brahmā, but also admonish and encourage all beings, bringing them joy and benefit through the teaching. For heavenly beings who are mired in foolish views, noble ones can also alert and awaken them, helping them to break through ignorance and distorted views and to move away from wrong views and attachments. Because such instruction is not confined to the human realm but encompasses the heavens and beings of various levels, it further reveals the vast capacity of noble ones in teaching living beings.

III.3 Conversations and Praise Among Noble Ones  
In their interactions with one another, noble ones speak to each other with kind and wholesome words. Their conversations are filled with joy and mutual accord, free of conflict and friction. This interaction is not only harmonious on an emotional level, but also expresses mutual recognition and praise of each other’s virtue and understanding. Through wholesome verbal exchange, noble ones can mutually reflect and support one another, displaying the pure, harmonious character of their community and enabling the true Dharma to circulate and be strengthened in such an atmosphere.

IV. Verbal Expression and the Content of True Dharma

IV.1 The Linguistic Qualities a Teacher Should Possess  
In verbal expression, a teacher should have several qualities. First, their tone should be gentle and approachable, so that listeners find it easy to draw near and do not shrink back due to harshness or sharpness. At the same time, their pronunciation must be clear and distinct, so that listeners can accurately grasp the content of every sentence and are not misled in understanding due to obscurity. Moreover, the voice should be pure and unrough, neither coarse nor piercing, so that those who hear can more easily focus and settle their minds. Furthermore, the language itself should be pleasing rather than dull, so that people do not feel bored and can more readily understand the meaning. The teacher needs to instruct using appropriate words that are free from clinging, avoiding extremist or dogmatic expressions, and by means of such fitting articulation they should encourage the listeners to feel joy, willingly accept the teaching, and engage in actual practice.

IV.2 Key Points of Content and the Core of Correct Teaching  
In terms of content, the meanings expressed by the teacher must be clearly knowable, enabling those who hear to grasp the Dharma being taught without feeling confused or unclear. The teaching should be able to display correct principles so that listeners can thereby establish right view and obtain true benefit in their actual lives. Such teaching should be encouraging, arousing in the listeners a spirit of diligence and a willingness to practice after hearing. Moreover, the core of correct teaching lies in the teacher’s ability to distinguish the wise from the foolish, to clearly understand differing capacities and conditions, and to ensure that everything they say is unfailingly the right path leading to liberation, not a distorted doctrine that deviates from it. In other words, what is taught must truly guide toward the path of liberation and accord with the goal of liberation, rather than being merely ornate rhetoric or empty ideas.

IV.3 The Importance of Consistency in Speech  
With regard to consistency in speech, what is said earlier and later must be mutually compatible and may not be self‑contradictory. If earlier statements are correct, then later statements should not be erroneous, nor should they overturn what was said before; conversely, if later statements are correct, then what was said earlier ought not to have been wrong. For teachings that contain contradictions between earlier and later statements, one should point out the problems so that they can be examined and corrected. Whether speech is consistent concerns not only logic and integrity, but also directly affects the listeners’ trust in the truthfulness of the teaching.

V. Penetrating the Dharma Realm and the Depth of Instruction

V.1 Manifestations of Thorough Understanding of Dharma Principles  
Those who are truly adept in the Dharma realm display several clear features in their understanding of Dharma principles. They can explain the teaching in accord with various different expressions and skillful means, not being confined to a single phrase or manner of expression, but flexibly using multiple kinds of language and expositions according to the capacities and circumstances of beings. The basis of such teaching is their deep understanding of the fundamental principles of the Dharma: they can grasp the true essence of the Dharma at its root, and thus will not lose direction amid changing situations. Because of this fundamental penetration, they possess an unobstructed ability in Dharma analysis and response: when others raise all kinds of questions, they can clearly analyze and explain them, dissolving doubts and revealing their integrated mastery of the Dharma’s meaning.

V.2 Depth and Flexibility Corresponding to Instruction  
In the concrete process of instruction, whether the time allotted for questions and answers is long or short, those who are adept in the Dharma realm can answer in accord with Dharma principles, without allowing time limitations to reduce their responses to perfunctory remarks or to lead them off topic. Regarding the same Dharma principle, they can explain it in many different ways, so that beings of differing capacities may all gain benefit and understanding from it. Through such multi‑faceted exposition, they demonstrate a thorough penetration of the reality of the Dharma realm: no matter from what angle they approach it, they are able to return to the same reality without deviating from the true Dharma, thereby enabling listeners, through repeated hearing and reflection, to gradually deepen their realization of the teaching.

VI. Pure and Impure Motives in Teaching

VI.1 Characteristics of Impure Teaching  
To discern the motive behind teaching, one can observe the difference between impure and pure intentions. For impure teaching, the underlying motive is to make others feel pleased with and well‑disposed toward oneself, hoping that through giving teachings the listeners will show favor, draw close, or praise oneself. Such teaching, arising from a craving for others’ attitudes and reactions, does not truly center upon the Dharma and the welfare of beings, but takes winning others’ favor as its goal. In this way, the teacher is easily led astray by the desire to ingratiate, by the pursuit of fame and gain, and thus deviates from the original intention of the true Dharma.

VI.2 Cognitive Basis and Motive of Pure Teaching  
Pure motives in teaching, by contrast, are founded on a correct understanding of several key features of the true Dharma. First, the teacher understands that the Dharma they expound has been well taught by the Blessed One, and is not something personally fabricated or arbitrarily conjectured. They also clearly realize that this Dharma yields its results in the present life, without delay; it is not an empty doctrine that can only be realized in some distant future, but a real law that can be verified here and now. Furthermore, this Dharma is “a teaching that, once spoken, can be seen for oneself”: when it is pointed out and explained, practitioners can personally confirm it, rather than having to rely solely on faith. Because this Dharma leads toward Nibbāna and ultimately brings complete liberation, it is a Dharma that the wise should each know for themselves, something every discerning person ought personally to experience and realize, not merely hear about from others.  
On this cognitive foundation, the pure motive in teaching is to enable those who hear the Dharma truly to understand it and then to practice accordingly, so that the instruction does not remain on the level of mere hearing, but leads the other to engage in actual cultivation. The teacher’s motive itself accords with the nature of wholesome qualities: all their speech is grounded in wholesome Dharma and is not intermixed with distortions or unwholesome states. Such a motive arises from compassion and pity for living beings, from a deep felt sense of their suffering, and from a wish that they escape the causes and results of suffering. Therefore they resolve to teach the Dharma, seeking no benefit for themselves and wishing only that beings may gain benefit.

VII. The Responsibility to Instruct and Principles for Transmitting the Teaching

VII.1 The Shared Responsibility to Instruct  
Within a community of practice or among fellow practitioners there exists a shared responsibility to instruct. Every practitioner should admonish and advise other practitioners and speak Dharma to them, so that all may mutually remind and support one another in the true Dharma. This responsibility does not belong only to a few teachers or elders, but is a duty that every practitioner should assume within the scope of their ability. Through mutual instruction and teaching, members of the community can avoid straying from the right path and, by mutual encouragement and assistance, can grow together.

VII.2 The Fundamental Motive for Transmitting the Teaching  
On a broader level, there is a universal and fundamental motive for transmitting the teaching: a mind of benefit and loving‑kindness toward all beings. The starting point for teaching and transmission should not be personal fame or gain, but the wish that beings thereby receive help and happiness. Such benefit and loving‑kindness are not confined to certain individuals, but extend to all sentient beings, regarding them with a vast and impartial mind as all worthy of being taught and benefiting from the Dharma. Thus the act of transmitting the teaching itself becomes a concrete expression of compassion.

VII.3 The Order of Teaching and Its Ultimate Aim  
In actual teaching, one should also consider the differing capacities of the audience and employ a certain order of priority. Instruction is first directed to those of superior faculties, enabling them to receive and practice the true Dharma in the quickest and most thorough way; on this basis, one then teaches those of middling faculties, adjusting the depth of exposition according to their ability and receptivity; finally, one instructs those of lesser faculties, offering more gradual and easily accepted methods so that they too may step onto the path of practice.  
Nevertheless, whether the recipients are of superior, middling, or lesser faculties, the ultimate aim of transmitting the teaching remains the same: to bring the listeners long‑term benefit and happiness. This benefit and happiness are not momentary sensory pleasures, but the profound stability grounded in the practice of the true Dharma, enabling beings in both present and future to obtain genuine and lasting well‑being from it.

VIII. Inner Realization and Outer Appearance

VIII.1 The Core Principle that Inner Realization Surpasses Outer Appearance  
In assessing a person’s value or attainment, there is a core principle that must be firmly kept in mind: one should not judge solely by outer appearance. Whether or not someone’s external form is imposing does not suffice to show the degree of their inner realization. This is especially true for those endowed with great supernormal powers and great might; the level of their inner realization often far surpasses what outward appearances can reveal. The true goal of practice is not to pursue external appearance or superficial merit, but to accomplish the realization of the unsurpassed holy life: in the here‑and‑now to personally know, realize, and dwell in the truth, so that one’s life is thoroughly aligned with the Dharma. This inner realization is the true standard for measuring the success of practice.

VIII.2 The Excellent Benefits of Teaching and the Radiance of the True Dharma  
When a teacher possesses the pure motives, perfect virtues, and correct methods described above, the act of teaching itself brings excellent benefits. Through correct and pure teaching, the radiance of the true Dharma is made manifest, so that truths that were obscured or neglected are once again seen and valued. Such teaching also raises high the banner of the noble ones’ Dharma, giving beings a clear direction to follow and letting them know where reliable instruction and the correct path are to be found. When the banner of the true Dharma is raised high in the world, beings are better able to distinguish the path of liberation from the confusion of various doctrines and thereby to enter onto the road of the true Dharma.
