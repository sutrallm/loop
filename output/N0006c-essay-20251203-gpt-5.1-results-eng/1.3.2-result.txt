<title> A General Treatise on the Principles of the Five Aggregates, Clinging, and the Path to Liberation </title>
<article>
I. The Goal of Liberation and the Practice of the Five Factors

The core of liberation is to know a path that can bring name‑and‑form—that is, all bodily and mental phenomena—to complete cessation without remainder. When a person truly penetrates such a Dhamma, they can cut off the bondage and fetters to existence and attain final liberation. To reach this goal there is a set of fivefold practical principles: one must sever five kinds of defilements, abandon five kinds of attachment, cultivate five kinds of undefiled pure qualities upwards, and transcend five kinds of fetters. One who completely accomplishes these four items is called “one who has crossed the flood,” symbolizing that they have crossed over the raging torrent of birth and death and are no longer swept away by it.

In concrete practice, what the liberator must cut off includes all mistaken clinging to names and concepts and to material forms, up to all obstructions and all notions that cling to material forms. On the other hand, “grasping” (upādāna) itself must be thoroughly understood and relinquished. There are four forms of grasping: grasping at sensual pleasures, grasping at views, grasping at rules and observances, and grasping at self-theorizing. Genuine practice is to make the mind “without taking up” at all these levels.

When the mind no longer calculates or clings to any basis of the mind, and is no longer imprisoned by the notion of “I,” it reaches a state where the mind does not grasp and does not remain stuck. Conversely, as long as consciousness is still blocked and clings to something, liberation cannot be obtained; only when consciousness no longer becomes blocked by, or grasps at, any object can liberation become possible.

In the course of cutting off, there is also a staged description in terms of “exhaustive pervasion” and “cutting off.” “Exhaustive pervasion” means to observe and counteract, without remainder, all phenomena that should be cut off; “cutting off” means the actual severing, so that they do not arise again. In the end, the practitioner must thoroughly uproot “identity view,” “what pertains to identity,” conceit, and all latent defilements (anusaya) to be called truly liberated.

Fetters are also clearly classified: there are five lower fetters, namely identity view, doubt, grasping at rules and observances, sensual desire, and ill will; and five higher fetters, namely attachment to the form realm, attachment to the formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. The connotation of the five higher fetters is: craving for the form realm, craving for the formless realm, pride in self, mental agitation and restlessness, and fundamental ignorance. These ten fetters constitute the net of bonds by which ordinary beings are tied to birth and death, and they must be severed step by step in practice.

II. Clinging as the Fundamental Obstruction

When sentient beings receive and try to understand the True Dhamma, there is a fundamental obstruction: most people delight in clinging, enjoy clinging, and even immerse themselves in clinging. Precisely because of this fondness for and habitual tendency toward clinging, it is hard for them to see and understand the truths of impermanence, suffering, and non‑self. This state is described as “dwelling in the five aggregates,” that is, dwelling in the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, and based on these, generating various views and attachments.

In essence, clinging is the arising of desire and craving toward the five bodily and mental phenomena—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. Wherever there is thinking and reflection, there is necessarily restlessness and change; restlessness and change in turn lead to attachment. Worldlings often instead delight in, and cling to, this state full of thinking and change, and thus sink ever deeper.

Whenever one generates feelings of pleasure, joy, or happiness with respect to any dhamma—that is, taking it as a lovable object and clinging to it—and cannot see as it really is the cessation of that dhamma, then various wrong views will arise, such as the view that “the Tathāgata exists after death,” and so on. Conversely, if one does not generate pleasure, joy, or happiness toward some dhamma, does not take it as a desirable object, and can see its cessation as it really is, then such wrong views do not arise. This fundamental principle applies not only to consciousness (the aggregate of consciousness) but equally and generally to the three classes of phenomena called “existence,” “grasping,” and “craving.” If one takes “grasping” as pleasant, joyful, and delightful, and has not realized the cessation of grasping as it really is, then corresponding wrong views arise; if not, they do not.

Clinging operates not only upon the five aggregates but also upon the six sense bases. Because the six sense bases exist, and because there is clinging and attachment to them, there arise comparisons and views such as “I am superior,” “I am equal,” or “I am inferior.” If one can directly observe that the six sense bases are all impermanent, suffering, and subject to decay, one then recognizes that when one does not cling to these impermanent, suffering, and decaying phenomena, those comparisons and views have no basis to arise.

Furthermore, the expression “tied on dry land” is used to refer to the mind of self‑conceit. This conceit is likewise a form of clinging that ties oneself to the comparisons of “I am superior, I am equal, I am inferior,” so that the mind cannot be at ease.

III. The Five Aggregates, Self‑View, and the Causal Basis of Suffering

The five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—comprise the totality of bodily and mental activity, and are also the key locus of bondage and suffering. Wrong cognition and clinging regarding the five aggregates form the root of “self‑view” and “view of a personal entity.” The so‑called “self‑view” concretely has four modes: taking the five aggregates as self, taking self as possessing the aggregates, taking the aggregates as in self, or taking self as in the aggregates. The accumulation and cessation of the bondage of life depend on whether these four self‑views continue to persist or are completely cut off.

An ordinary uninstructed person who does not understand the teaching of the noble ones often clings to the five aggregates as “I,” or thinks that “I” possess the aggregates, that “I” am in the aggregates, or that the aggregates are in “me.” They cannot see as it really is that the five aggregates are impermanent, suffering, non‑self, conditioned, and harmful (in that they bring suffering). Therefore, by clinging to the aggregates as “I,” they remain for a long time immersed in suffering and affliction. This wrong cognition appears concretely as: taking form as “I,” or thinking that “I” possess form, that “I” am in form, or that form is in “me.” When such clung‑to form undergoes change and alteration, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. The same error and suffering apply equally to the aggregates of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness.

From a broader perspective, all self‑view arises from clinging to the five aggregates subject to clinging. The ordinary person wrongly cognizes the five aggregates subject to clinging as “I,” and again understands them in four ways: I am the aggregates, I possess the aggregates, I exist in the aggregates, or the aggregates exist in me. As long as there is clinging to any one of the aggregates, the notion of “I” arises accordingly; if there is no clinging, then the notion of “I” does not arise. Specifically: clinging to form gives rise to the notion of “I”; if one does not cling to form, such a notion does not arise. The same is true of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness: clinging to them gives rise to the notion of “I,” and not clinging does not.

This clinging further shows up as: taking form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as self; or taking self as possessing them; or taking self as existing within them; or taking them as existing within self, and clinging to the aggregates as “this is what I possess.” When the aggregates thus clung to undergo change, inner suffering in the form of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arises. Conversely, if there was originally no clinging to certain aggregates, then even if they change, such inner sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair will not arise.

Here there is an important principle regarding the arising of suffering and happiness: in the past, present, or future, if a practitioner takes the lovable, pleasing objects of the six sense bases as permanent, as happiness, as belonging to self, as without danger, as secure, then their love (craving) for them increases. As love increases, “upadhi” (acquisitions, substrata of existence, the “fuel” of becoming) increases; as upadhi increases, suffering increases. In this way one cannot be liberated from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, and cannot be liberated from suffering. Conversely, if one regards these lovable, pleasing objects as impermanent, as suffering, as non‑self, as like a disease, as fearful and dreadful, then one can relinquish love for them; when love is relinquished, upadhi is relinquished; when upadhi is relinquished, suffering is relinquished. In this way one can be liberated from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, and realize liberation from suffering.

Regarding the relation between the five aggregates and suffering, there is a clear causal chain for the arising of fear. When the aggregate of form that is clung to undergoes change, consciousness arises in dependence on that changed form; because consciousness changes, fear arises; the mind falls into a state of desiccation, and finally astonishment, perplexity, expectation, clinging, and fear arise. Lining this up with the five aggregates one by one, we have: clinging to the aggregate of form as self, and change in form leads to fear; clinging to the aggregate of feeling as self, and change in feeling leads to fear; clinging to the aggregate of perception as self, and change in perception leads to fear; clinging to the aggregate of formations as self, and change in formations leads to fear; clinging to the aggregate of consciousness as self, and change in consciousness leads to fear. Conversely, if one does not cling to the aggregate of form as self, then change in form does not give rise to fear; if one does not cling to feeling as self, change in feeling does not give rise to fear; and likewise for perception, formations, and consciousness—without clinging to them as self, their change does not bring about fear.

When the practitioner walks the path of non‑clinging, then in the face of changes in the five aggregates, consciousness does not arise following those changes, fear does not arise, the mind does not become desiccated, and in the end there is no astonishment, perplexity, expectation, clinging, or fear. Since all bodily and mental phenomena must change, as long as there is clinging there will inevitably be fear and distress. Only by recognizing the impermanent nature of bodily and mental phenomena and not clinging to them can one be freed from fear and distress.

As to the fundamental characteristics of the five aggregates, they are all impermanent, suffering, subject to change, and not‑self, not “what pertains to self.” Precisely because the aggregates are not self and not belonging to self, each aggregate is not something that should be taken as owned by oneself; they ought to be relinquished. With respect to the aggregates and all their characteristics, desire, craving, and sensual craving should all be severed. Once severed, benefit and happiness are obtained. The experiential conclusion of this principle is: precisely because the aggregates are not self and not belonging to self, clinging to them should be cut off; once this clinging is cut off, one is bound to obtain genuine benefit and happiness.

From the perspective of practice, if one clings to any thing, then based on that there arise designations and comparative notions; if one does not cling to anything, then such designations and comparisons do not arise. This echoes the earlier point about the notion of “I”: every concept of “I” arises from clinging.

IV. Worldlings and Noble Disciples: Their Attitude Toward the Five Aggregates and the Outcome in Terms of Suffering

The fundamental difference between worldlings and noble disciples lies precisely in their cognition and attitude toward the five aggregates. A worldling, lacking right view and not drawing near the teachings of the noble ones and good spiritual friends, often mistakenly clings to the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as “I,” and thinks, “I possess consciousness,” “there is consciousness in me,” or “I am in consciousness.” Because of this clinging, they revolve around the five aggregates without cease, unable to be liberated from them, and thus are unable to be freed from form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, as well as from birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

An instructed noble disciple, however, possesses right view and draws near the teachings of the noble ones and good spiritual friends. They do not think that the five aggregates are self, nor that there is a self in the aggregates or aggregates in a self; they do not think that they own the aggregates, nor do they think that consciousness is self, that they possess consciousness, that there is a self in consciousness, or that consciousness is in a self. Regarding the teaching of “no self and nothing that is ‘mine’,” worldlings often feel fear; noble disciples, by contrast, do not feel fear, but instead generate confidence in the understanding that “these are not self, not what pertains to self, and there should be no self and nothing that is ‘mine’,” and by this they cut off the five lower fetters.

A noble disciple who has heard much Dhamma will generate revulsion and dispassion toward the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. Because of revulsion they become dispassionate; because of dispassion they abandon craving; because craving is abandoned they attain liberation. At the moment of liberation, the wisdom of liberation arises: they know that the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more of this becoming. This process can also be described as follows: through seeing things as they really are, the practitioner generates disenchantment with the five aggregates; through disenchantment they draw far away from craving for the aggregates; through drawing away from craving, the mind attains liberation; at the moment of liberation, liberating knowledge arises, understanding that the round of rebirth is finished, the pure practice is established, what needed to be done has been completed, and there will be no future flow of birth and death.

Likewise, a noble disciple who is able to observe in this way will generate disenchantment with form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness; through disenchantment they move away from craving; through moving away from craving they attain liberation. The wisdom that arises at liberation likewise knows that the round of life is exhausted, the pure practice is established, what had to be done is accomplished, and there will be no future rebirth. From another angle, when beings, because they cling to the flavor of pleasure that accompanies the aggregates, become defiled, defilements arise; if they can see clearly that the nature of the aggregates is suffering, they give rise to repulsion, then to dispassion, and thereby attain purity. If beings regard the aggregates as sources of pleasure, thinking that they are accompanied by pleasure and not by suffering, they become defiled thereby. If they can observe as it really is the suffering nature of the aggregates, they generate a sense of revulsion, then dispassion, attain purity, and ultimately are freed from the bondage of the aggregates, reaching a state of mental purity.

Worldlings are bound by the bondage of each one of the five aggregates; this bondage is complete, both inwardly and outwardly. As a result, they see neither the beginning of suffering nor its end; they are born in bondage, die in bondage, and pass in bondage from this life to the next. Noble disciples, on the other hand, are not bound by any bondage of the aggregates; they can be freed from bondage both inwardly and outwardly. As a result, they can see clearly the beginning and end of suffering and are completely liberated from all suffering.

In actual practice there is also the expression “not dwelling in the home.” This “not dwelling in the home” means that for the liberated one, desire, craving, clinging, and latent tendencies toward the five realms (i.e. five aggregates) of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness have been completely cut off and no longer arise, and thus they are said “not to dwell in the home.” Correspondingly, when a monk comes to a confident understanding that “these are not self, not what pertains to self; there should be no self and nothing that is ‘mine’,” he can cut off the five lower fetters; he further distances himself from conceit, transcends all conceit‑defilements, and with respect to the conscious body and all external phenomena no longer generates the notions of “I” and “mine.”

Since the aggregates themselves are subject to destruction and disintegration, clinging to what disintegrates inevitably leads to disaster and suffering, just as clinging to something fragile will eventually lead to a fall. The aggregates are impermanent, ever‑changing phenomena; whatever is impermanent is suffering. If one does not cling to these impermanent and changing aggregates, then the various wrong views and the ensuing suffering will not arise.

The relationship between the aggregates and “I” also needs careful discernment. The practice of contemplating non‑self is not to see any self in the five aggregates subject to clinging, nor to see anything as “mine” in them; one does not say that form is self, nor that there is a self apart from form. Likewise, one does not say that feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness is self, nor that there is a self apart from consciousness. Through such contemplation, one can shatter the common notion of a “substantial self” and keep the mind from being drawn into dependence, grasping, and present craving. When clinging arises in this present life, suffering arises with it; when clinging in this present life ceases, suffering ceases with it.

Given that the five aggregates are impermanent, wrong ways of clinging show up as: seeing form as self, seeing self as possessing form, seeing self as in form, or seeing form as in self; and likewise for the other four aggregates. Because the aggregates exist, and one clings to them and loves them, there arise painful feeling, self‑view, eternalist view, annihilationist view, wrong view, identity view, fetters, craving, and clinging. Conversely, if one recognizes that the aggregates are impermanent, suffering, and changing, and does not cling to these impermanent, suffering, changing phenomena, then neither pleasure nor pain arises inwardly, nor do self‑view, eternalist view, annihilationist view, wrong view, identity view, fetters, craving, or clinging arise.

When a practitioner becomes disenchanted with the aggregates and cuts off craving for them, they can completely free themselves from bondage and no longer take up another life. Here there is an important core principle: when one feels repulsion toward the aggregates, delight is exhausted; when delight is exhausted, craving is exhausted; when craving is exhausted, delight is exhausted—the two mutually bring each other to an end. Wherever consciousness is blocked and clings, there is no liberation; when consciousness is not blocked and does not cling, liberation is obtained.

In the functioning of the aggregates there is another key point: if one observes the aggregates as they truly are and sees their impermanence, suffering, and non‑self, the mind no longer clings to them at all, draws far away from all taints and defilements, and attains liberation; one’s views are thereby purified and no longer follow after wrong views connected with past and future. The mental attitude is also transformed: one no longer stubbornly and wrongly clings to anything, and with respect to form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness the mind has nothing to grasp.

Right knowledge that the aggregates are not self and not what pertains to self can shatter the wrong thinking of worldlings. Noble disciples can cut off ignorance and give rise to wisdom; because ignorance is destroyed and wisdom arises, none of the aforementioned wrong thoughts arise any more. When the mind no longer has any clinging toward the aggregates, it is far removed from all taints and defilements and attains liberation.

V. The Many Forms of Wrong View and Their Roots

The formation of wrong views follows a common basic principle: because the five aggregates exist, and one clings to them and loves them, various wrong views arise. When beings cling to impermanent phenomena as permanent, this is ignorance, and it generates many wrong views.

Among wrong views, there is one type that asserts the existence of an eternal, unchanging, undeteriorating, unaging, unwithering, undying, unborn realm, and claims that above this realm there is no higher way of renunciation. The corresponding correct understanding points out that above the realm clung to by such wrong cognition there still exists a higher level of renunciation. The root of ignorance lies precisely in taking all impermanent phenomena as permanent.

With regard to dependent origination, certain views are also mistaken—for example, the view that pleasure and pain are produced by oneself alone (self‑causation), produced entirely by others (other‑causation), produced jointly by self and other (both‑causation), or arise without any cause (no‑cause theory). These all violate the principle of dependent origination. Likewise, regarding the relation between life and body, to hold that “life and body are the same” or that “life and body are different” are both wrong views; the middle‑way right view stays clear of these two extremes and does not fall into either side.

Wrong views also appear as eternalism, annihilationism, and skeptical doubt. Eternalism maintains that there is an eternal, unchanging self after death; annihilationism denies all existence; skeptical doubt vacillates and hesitates regarding the True Dhamma. All these views are based on clinging to the aggregates and to various objects.

Beyond clinging to the aggregates, there is also clinging and craving toward what is seen, what is heard, what is thought, what is known, what is attained, what is sought, and what the mind attends to and investigates. Because one clings to and craves these objects, wrong views arise. When one clings to any one of the aggregates or to any mental content, and generates craving for it, various worldly wrong views are produced. For example, one may think that the world is eternally unchanging; or that the world is impermanent and ends in annihilation; or that the world is finite; or that the world is infinite.

Further, because form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness exist, and because of clinging and craving for these aggregates, wrong views such as “life is identical with the body” or “life is different from the body” arise, and also four views about the Tathāgata after death. For instance: that the Tathāgata exists after death; that the Tathāgata does not exist after death; that the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death; or that the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death. These questions arise and are clung to precisely because there is clinging to the aggregates.

Regarding the self after death, wrong views take many forms. Some think that after death there is a “with form, without disease” self; some think that after death there is a “formless, without disease” self; some think that after death there is a “both with form and formless, without disease” self; some think that after death there is a “neither with form nor formless, without disease” self. Others think that after death there is a “purely happy, without disease” self, or a “purely painful, without disease” self, or a “both happy and painful, without disease” self, or a “neither painful nor happy, without disease” self. All these wrong views arise because there are the painful five aggregates, and because one clings to suffering and craves suffering, and so imagines and asserts in many ways that “after death there is a self without disease.”

There are also some worldly opinions such as: thinking that the world is eternal; that the world is non‑eternal; that the world is finite; that the world is infinite; that life is identical with the body; that life is different from the body; that the Tathāgata exists after death; that the Tathāgata does not exist after death; that the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death; or that the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death. All these various views belong to a part of the sixty‑two types of views. The fundamental principle states: as long as there is a view of a personal entity (identity view), the sixty‑two views will arise; when identity view is absent, the sixty‑two views do not arise.

There is a specific type of wrong view that even claims that “the wind does not blow, the rivers do not flow, pregnant women do not give birth, the sun and moon neither rise nor set, and the world stands fixed like a pillar,” maintaining that phenomena are eternally unchanging; another type maintains that after death there is a self that is neither suffering nor happiness and is without disease. Both of these wrong views can arise from clinging to any one of the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness. Their common root is still this: because the five aggregates exist, and one clings to and craves these aggregates.

Among all these wrong views there is one all‑embracing rule: as long as one does not cling to these impermanent, suffering, and changing phenomena, none of the above wrong worldly views arise, nor do views such as “the Tathāgata exists after death” and so on. Therefore, with respect to the changing, impermanent, suffering five aggregates, if one does not cling to them, then none of the various views about “a self existing after death” will arise.

VI. The Two Extremes of Eternalism, the Nature of Life, and the Reason for Undeclared Questions

Many debates revolve around the two positions that “life and body are the same” or “life and body are different.” Middle‑way right view points out that both are wrong. Related questions include: “Is life identical with the body?” and “Is life separate from the body?” These questions are classified among those that should not be answered. The reason no answer is given is that these views and questions are all built on clinging to the five aggregates. As long as this fundamental clinging is not transcended, answering “yes” or “no” merely shifts between different errors.

Outside ascetics cling to these positions because they are attached to the existence of the five aggregates. They regard form as self, regard self as possessing form, regard form as in self, and self as in form; and they do the same for feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. The liberated ones are precisely the opposite: they have no clinging to the aggregates; they do not think that form is self, nor that they possess form, nor that form is in self, nor that self is in form; and likewise for the other four aggregates.

Thus, clinging to the aggregates is the fundamental cause for the formation of worldly views of eternalism and the like. This core principle applies broadly to all views about the nature of the world, the relation between life and body, and the state of the Tathāgata after death. As long as there is clinging to the aggregates, one will form affirmative or negative views about these questions; if one transcends clinging to the aggregates, one will not generate any affirmative or negative view about them at all.

Another related error is to think that consciousness can exist independently apart from the aggregates and that one can describe its coming and going, its death and birth, its increase and expansion. This view is likewise a mistaken cognition, because it takes an abstracted “consciousness” divorced from the aggregates as having a real self‑nature and ignores the fact that consciousness arises dependently together with the aggregates.

VII. Correct Observation, Right View, and the Sequence Leading to Liberation

The core of right view is to see all phenomena as impermanent, as suffering, and as non‑self. When one can see as it truly is that all phenomena are impermanent, one abandons wrong view; when one can see as it truly is that all phenomena are suffering, one abandons identity view (sakkāya‑diṭṭhi); when one can see as it truly is that all phenomena are non‑self, one abandons self‑view. Through such seeing, the practitioner no longer pursues wrong views related to past and future and no longer stubbornly and wrongly clings to anything; with respect to form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, the mind clings to nothing.

The concrete sequence is: through directly observing the impermanent, suffering, and non‑self nature of the aggregates, the practitioner generates disenchantment with them; because of disenchantment, they draw far away from craving for the aggregates; because they draw far away from craving, the mind attains liberation; at the moment of liberation, liberating wisdom arises, knowing that the round of rebirth is ended, the pure holy life is established, what had to be done is completed, and there will be no future flow of birth and death. Although this process is expressed repeatedly in different places, its content is the same: disenchantment leads to the cessation of delight; the cessation of delight leads to the cessation of craving, and the cessation of craving in turn brings delight to an end; the two mutually extinguish one another, ultimately reaching the liberated state devoid of craving and delight.

After such wise observation, the mind no longer clings at all to the aggregates, draws far away from all taints and defilements, and attains liberation. Therefore, noble disciples do not seek answers in wrong views about past and future, nor cling to any present object. They no longer regard the flavor of pleasure that accompanies the aggregates as genuine happiness, but see through to its nature as suffering, give rise to revulsion, then dispassion, and thereby attain purity.

In the cutting off of views there is a concise and clear principle: if one does not cling to these impermanent, suffering, changing phenomena, then wrong views do not arise, nor do any worldly wrong opinions; one thereby is free from clinging, severed from doubts. When a monk gives rise to firm understanding that “these are not self, not what pertains to self; there should be no self and nothing that is ‘mine’,” he can cut off the five lower fetters. Noble disciples no longer feel fear regarding “no self and nothing that is ‘mine’” but instead regard it as the door to liberation.

Through all this practice and contemplation, the core law of bondage and liberation becomes ever more evident: when consciousness is blocked and clings, there is no liberation; when consciousness is unblocked and does not cling, liberation is obtained. Finally, when “self‑view,” “view of what pertains to self,” conceit, and all latent defilements have been pervasively exhausted and cut off, and there is no longer any craving or clinging toward the aggregates, the practitioner is freed from all bondage of the aggregates, freed from birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, and accomplishes the state of ultimate liberation.
