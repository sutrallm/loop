<article>
I. The Impermanence of the World and the Passage of Time

I.1 Time and the Fading of Youth

Time has never ceased its course in this world; day and night alternate without pause. As time passes, the youthful phase that every living being undergoes inevitably comes to an end and never returns. This ceaseless alternation of day and night and the fading of youth shows that all phenomena in the world are changing without end, and that there is no fixed, unchanging state.

I.2 Reflections on Death and the Motivation for Liberation

Within this unceasing process of change, death—the end point of life—always exists and cannot be escaped. When a person observes the fact of death as it truly is, a sense of alertness should arise in the heart, so that one no longer lives carelessly. It is precisely this vigilance toward death and this clear recognition of it that can arouse a powerful inner drive to seek liberation, making one unwilling to simply follow the current of impermanence, and inspiring the wish to find a way that transcends birth and death.

II. The Formation, Growth, and Root of Life

II.1 The Stages in the Development of Life in the Womb

When a life is formed in the mother’s womb, it follows definite stages of development. At first, the stage known as “kalala” forms in the womb. As time goes on, the “kalala” gradually develops into “arbuda.” After the “arbuda” stage, flesh begins to form, and this flesh then coagulates into a solid body. Once the solid body has formed, various limbs and joints arise, and the basic structure of the body is thereby complete. Subsequently, hair and nails gradually grow out, the external appearance becomes increasingly distinct, and the life in the womb matures step by step in this way.

II.2 The Material Conditions on Which Life’s Growth Depends

Throughout this entire process of development, the life dwelling in the mother’s uterus does not exist independently out of nothing; it must rely on the drinks and foods that the mother takes in. What the mother drinks and eats is transformed into the provisions for the fetus’ growth, becoming the fundamental material condition that nourishes its body and promotes each stage of its development. It is precisely by means of the nourishment provided by this food and drink that the life in the womb can gradually grow and become strong, completing the whole progression from “kalala” to the point where the limbs are complete and hair and nails have all appeared.

II.3 The Continuity of Life and Its Root

However, life is not only about growing in the womb. The continuation and circulation of life have a fundamental condition on which they depend. The ongoing flow of any life must necessarily rely on its root; if this root is lacking, the circulation of life will not occur. In other words, life cannot continue to cycle on once it has lost its support. Its ongoing turning must depend on some fundamental cause in order to keep being prolonged.

III. The Four Kinds of Nourishment and the Continuation of Sentient Life

III.1 The Definition and Types of the Four Kinds of Nourishment

To understand the continuation of life, one must recognize the conditions that sustain it. The so‑called “four kinds of nourishment” are the four types of provisions and conditions by which sentient beings are able to continue, maintain life, receive nourishment, and pursue further rebirth.

The first kind of nourishment is physical food, which refers to all coarse or fine, material forms of food—everything that beings take into the mouth and that can directly nourish the body. The second kind is contact as nourishment, which is the contact itself that arises from the meeting of body‑mind and external objects. The third kind is intention as nourishment, which refers to volition or thought—the various ideas and intentions in the mind that form a kind of psychological sustenance. The fourth kind is consciousness as nourishment, that is, the conscious activity that knows and discriminates.

These four together are called the four kinds of nourishment. On the one hand, they are the conditions that enable sentient beings to continue and maintain life. On the other, they are the provisions that allow life to receive nutrients and support its continuation and further rebirth. The four kinds of nourishment are, respectively, physical food, contact, intention, and consciousness, ranging from the material to the mental, from external contact to inner awareness, and thus encompassing all dimensions needed to sustain life.

III.2 The Function of the Four Kinds of Nourishment and the Nurturing of Life

The function of the four kinds of nourishment is to enable all sentient beings to continue and maintain life. They are the four key conditions by which beings receive the nourishment of life. In other words, these four kinds of nourishment not only allow present life to keep functioning and extend its span, they also constitute the provisions on which beings rely to seek rebirth and continue to revolve in birth and death. Without these four kinds of nourishment, life would lose the basis for its maintenance and continuation, and existence itself would not even be possible.

III.3 The Nature of Physical Food, What Should Be Understood Through It, and Its Result

Among the four kinds of nourishment, physical food has an obviously material character. Its nature consists of all foods, coarse or fine, that are material in nature—anything that can be taken in and chewed, enter the body, and become part of the body’s composition falls within the scope of physical food.

Through reflecting on and observing physical food, what one ought to understand is the craving that arises for the five strands of sensual pleasure—that is, the delightful objects sought by the various senses. From our dependence on and enjoyment of physical food, we can detect this grasping at the five sensual pleasures. If, based on this awareness, one can turn back and examine oneself and then cut off the various fetters brought by craving and physical food, one can be freed from their bonds, no longer returning to this world to be reborn, and no longer driven to revolve by these desires and by food and drink.

III.4 The Dependence of Life Phenomena on the Four Kinds of Nourishment and Their Cessation

When we observe the reality of life, we can, in turn, clearly know several levels. First, we must accurately observe the “existence of life phenomena,” to acknowledge and clearly see that life is indeed operating in the present. Next, we must accurately observe that all life phenomena arise dependent on the “nourishment” that sustains life. Whether the body is supported by physical food, or the body‑mind is sustained by contact, intention, and consciousness, life phenomena never depart from these dependencies.

Finally, we must accurately observe that once the “nourishment” that serves as life’s provision ceases—whether material food or mental sustenance no longer continues—then life phenomena themselves must necessarily tend toward cessation, manifesting a law of decline and eventual ending. Observed in this way, one can appreciate the inseparable relationship between life and the four kinds of nourishment.

IV. The Growth of Consciousness and Its Dependent Relationship with the Five Aggregates

IV.1 A Simile and the Conditions for the Growth of Consciousness

How consciousness grows and expands can be explained using the simile of a seed. In the world there are five kinds of seeds: roots, stems, branches, nodes, and “seeds of seeds.” For these five types of seeds to truly grow and expand, three conditions must all be present. First, the seed itself must be intact and undamaged. Second, there must be soil—that is, the earth element—for the seed to fall upon. Third, there must be water to moisten the seed and enable it to sprout.

In this simile, the earth element stands for the various objects in which the four types of consciousness can alight and grasp—that is, the domains that can serve as supports for consciousness. The water element stands for the liking and attachment that arise toward these objects, the inner affection and clinging to them. As for the five kinds of seeds themselves, they stand for consciousness together with the various conditions that nourish it and enable it to grow. When these conditions are present, consciousness grows, extends, and expands, just like a seed that flourishes with the help of soil and water.

IV.2 Consciousness’ Dependence on Form, Feeling, Perception, and Formations

In actual operation, when consciousness clings to objects such as form, feeling, perception, and formations, it takes these objects as its supports. Relying on its liking for and attachment to such an object, consciousness begins to grow and expand within it. That is to say, consciousness, driven by attachment, proliferates and extends its sphere of activity based on these four categories of objects: form, feeling, perception, and formations.

If someone maintains that consciousness can exist independently, apart from form, feeling, perception, and formations, and that even without relying on these objects it can still freely come and go, undergo death and rebirth, and continue to grow, such a claim is utterly impossible. Consciousness must rely on form, feeling, perception, and formations in order to exist and operate; it cannot detach from these conditions and stand alone.

IV.3 The Pattern of Delighting in the Five Aggregates and Being Consumed by Them

Looking further, if one delights in and clings to the five aggregates that constitute body and mind—that is, form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—whether in the past, present, or future, then in past, present, and future alike one will be “eaten” by those aggregates, that is, dominated, bound, and consumed by them. If one reflects and considers, one can clearly know: at present one is being consumed by the five aggregates; looking back, in the past one was also consumed by the five aggregates; and if one still gives rise to delight in the future five aggregates, then in the future one will likewise continue to be consumed by the five aggregates, making liberation hard to attain.

V. The Aggregation of Beings and the Rapid Change of Lifespan

V.1 The Volitional Nature Underlying the Aggregation of Beings

With regard to the formation of individual and collective life, beings do not gather together at random, but aggregate based on the fundamental nature of their volitions. That is, the inner volitions and tendencies of beings become the fundamental force by which they attract, approach, and combine with one another. Beings whose volitional natures are similar or compatible will gather together, forming particular groups and relational structures.

V.2 The Rapid Disappearance of Lifespans and States of Existence

Within this multitude of life phenomena that have come together in this way, the lifespan of beings and their states of existence are, however, what change and vanish most rapidly. Life may seem drawn out, but in the flux of impermanence it is in fact extremely brief and easily lost. Lifespan diminishes day by day; states of existence change from moment to moment. Whether in physical or mental respects, everything is constantly changing at great speed, with not the slightest pause or enduring constancy.

VI. Aging, Illness, and Death that Life Must Undergo, and the Nature of the Physical Body

VI.1 The Inevitability of Change in Life

For any form of life, aging, illness, and death are unavoidable processes. Life is bound to undergo the changes brought by advancing years, as the functions of body and mind cease to be as they were. Illness will also appear at various stages, damaging the body and bringing painful experiences. Finally, death brings this particular phase of life to an end. All of this belongs to the inevitable trajectory of change in life; there are absolutely no exceptions.

VI.2 The Universal Characteristics of Aging and Death

Aging is not merely an increasing number of years; it concretely alters one’s external appearance. The temporarily manifest beauty that once appeared is destroyed by the process of aging; the face is no longer as before, and physical strength declines. This aging process cannot be escaped; in the end, all life will be ruined by old age. Even if someone lives as long as a hundred years, they still cannot avoid the arrival of death. Regardless of the length of lifespan, the ultimate outcome of aging and death is the same.

VI.3 The Four-Element Composition of the Body and Its Inevitable Destruction

Looking again at the body itself, this fleshly body is composed of the four great elements: earth, water, fire, and wind. It comes into being through the union of father and mother; it does not arise on its own out of nothing. From birth onward, this body must depend on food and drink for its maintenance; without the support of nourishment, it cannot survive. Even so, this body is still bound to undergo destruction, disintegration, severance, and decay. After life ends, the body finally breaks apart and scatters, and may in the end be consumed by various other living beings, becoming their nourishment. From its composition and maintenance to its destruction, everything about the body reveals the nature of impermanence and lack of self‑mastery.

VII. Right Eating and the Practice of the Path

VII.1 The Essentials of Discerning the Proper Measure of Food and the Correct Attitude

In daily life, food is an important condition for sustaining the body, but one’s attitude and approach toward eating are likewise closely tied to the state of body and mind and to the results of practice. When taking food, one should do so with careful reflection, rather than indulging oneself by following craving and habit. The purpose of eating should not be amusement and luxury, nor should it be to make the body splendid or to adorn oneself in order to please others. The correct attitude is to regard food as a means of keeping the body going, so as to prevent harm from arising, to keep the body from breaking down, and to enable oneself to practice the pure holy life smoothly.

VII.2 The Practical Benefits of Eating and a Life of Ease

When one takes food with this correct attitude, multiple practical benefits can arise. First, it can eliminate old painful feelings, alleviating the suffering that arises from bodily hunger or imbalance. Second, it can prevent new painful feelings, so that one does not incur fresh physical and mental suffering by overeating or eating inappropriately. In this way, one can enjoy a life of ease and keep both conduct and mindset free from fault. By using food to maintain the body so that it becomes an aid to practice rather than a cause of downfall, one can establish a life of blameless ease.

VII.3 Temperance in Eating and the Elements of Practice in Seeing Things as They Are

Knowing moderation in eating is an important practice for present‑life well‑being and for the path of liberation. When taking food, one should again reflect deeply, confirming that one is not eating for the sake of amusement, not for the sake of decorating and beautifying the body, but solely to maintain the body’s continuation, to prevent harm to body and mind, and to enable oneself to benefit from a pure life of practice. If one can eat with this attitude, one can eliminate old painful feelings, prevent new painful feelings from arising, and thereby gain a blameless and easeful life.

In actual practice, one must also add the work of observation with regard to food. When eating, one should observe, either accurately or inaccurately, the functions of food itself, examining whether one is eating for amusement, for conceit, for adornment, for display, or whether one is eating for the rightful purposes of protecting the body and supporting practice. Through such observation and self‑vigilance, one can truly achieve temperance in eating and transform food into an aid to the path, rather than letting it become a breeding ground for craving and heedlessness.

VIII. The Rarity of Human Birth and the Auspicious Conditions of the Present

VIII.1 Three Extremely Rare Circumstances

Among the vast conditions of the world, there are three circumstances regarded as extremely rare. The first is obtaining a human body—being born into the world in human form, with relatively complete rationality and capacity for practice, which is truly not easy. The second is the appearance of a Buddha in the world—having a fully awakened one present to teach the Dharma and guide beings on the path of liberation, which is exceedingly rare. The third is the transmission of the Buddha’s teaching in the world—having the opportunity to hear and practice the true Dharma, which is all the more precious. If any one of these three is lacking, the conditions for practice and liberation are greatly diminished; hence they are seen as three exceptionally rare circumstances.

VIII.2 The Exceptional Conditions Now Fully Present

From the standpoint of our present situation, it is evident that these three rare circumstances are now simultaneously present. First, a precious human body has already been obtained; we are not in a state where we cannot hear the Dharma or lack the capacity to practice. Second, a Buddha has already appeared in the world; although the time of his manifestation was limited, his awakening and teaching have become established historical fact. Moreover, the true Dharma taught by the Buddha has been widely transmitted, giving people the opportunity to encounter, study, and put it into practice. For this reason, the conditions of the present are extraordinarily auspicious and hard to come by: we possess a human body, there has been the actual appearance of a Buddha, and the true Dharma is widely available. Thus we hold the key conditions for setting out on the path of liberation.

Through a comprehensive observation of the impermanence of time, the formation and circulation of life, the function of the four kinds of nourishment, the relation between consciousness and the five aggregates, the aggregation of beings and the rapid disappearance of lifespan, as well as temperance in food and the rarity of human birth, one can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of life and the urgency of practice, and make good use of these rare and auspicious present conditions to advance along the path of liberation.
