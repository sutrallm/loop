<title> The Wise Person’s Self-Love and Self-Protection: A Complete Vision of Practice from Body, Speech, and Mind to the Distancing from Unwholesome States </title>
<article>
I. The Wise Person’s Attitude toward Practice and the Contrast with the Heedless

I.1 Prudent Preparation and Self-Knowledge  
Truly wise and virtuous people are first of all clearly aware of their own actions. They have a clear and thorough understanding of everything they do in body, speech, and mind. On the basis of this lucid self-knowledge, they do not let their actions drift along with circumstances, but instead make correct preparation for their actions in advance, so that the actions that are about to occur will develop in a suitable, upright, and wholesome direction. This attitude of prior preparation is the basic stance with which the wise and virtuous face life and spiritual practice.

I.2 The Mental State of the Heedless and Their Everyday Faults  
In contrast to the wise, the inner world of the heedless person appears in a very different way. His mind first inclines toward the unwholesome actions that occur within his own household; regarding the unwholesome behavior done by his own family, he not only does not feel ashamed, but clings to it in his thoughts again and again. At the same time, his mind is also bound to the wealth of others: he is always preoccupied with the assets and benefits that others possess, and is unwilling to abide contentedly with what he has rightly obtained.  
In daily life, such a heedless person lies down immediately after eating—he eats and then at once reclines—spending each day in a posture of laziness, letting his days slip away in negligence. Going further, his mind is like a village headman running a village: it is constantly rushing outward, placing his energy and attention on external affairs and desires, single-mindedly chasing external objects, and unable to abide in or reflect upon his own mind and conduct. Through this contrast, one can clearly see the sharp difference between the wise person’s prudent preparation and the heedless person’s laziness of mind.

II. The Nature of Self-Love and the Criteria of Conduct

II.1 The Standard for Judging Whether One Truly Loves Oneself  
When speaking of “loving oneself,” whether one truly loves oneself is not decided by what a person says with his mouth, but is completely determined by his actual behavior. The standard for judging self-love must return to the manifestations of conduct in the three aspects of body, speech, and mind.  
To see whether someone really loves himself, one must judge by the goodness or badness shown in the things he does, the words he speaks, and the thoughts that arise—these three forms of action. When bodily, verbal, and mental actions are wholesome, this shows that his self-love is genuine. Conversely, if these actions incline toward what is unwholesome, this indicates that his love for himself is not in fact real, and may even be nothing more than a verbal claim. In other words, the wholesome or unwholesome quality of conduct is the key basis for examining whether a person truly loves himself.

II.2 The Behavioral Characteristics of One Who Truly Loves Himself in Body, Speech, and Mind  
If a person truly loves himself, in his bodily actions he will choose wholesome deeds, keeping bodily conduct far away from various evil actions and improper behavior. In speech, he will also perform wholesome actions, so that the words he speaks incline toward truthfulness, kindness, and benefit, and he will not use harsh speech, lies, or divisive speech to harm others.  
At the same time, in his mental activity he will also rely on what is wholesome, keeping his thoughts pure and upright, and avoiding having his inner thinking and decisions dominated by unwholesome mental factors such as greed, hatred, and delusion. When a person in these three areas—body, speech, and mind—all inclines in this way toward wholesome conduct, then his overall actual behavior can testify that he is indeed cherishing and protecting himself, and is truly someone who knows how to love himself.

II.3 Concrete Manifestations of One Who Does Not Truly Love Himself  
Conversely, if someone, although he verbally claims to love himself, in bodily terms nevertheless performs unwholesome actions—creating various unwholesome deeds with his body—then his bodily conduct shows that he does not truly love himself. Likewise, if his verbal actions are unwholesome—he often uses speech to hurt others, deceive others, or stir up discord—then his verbal actions also deny that he loves himself.  
In addition, if his mental activity is likewise unwholesome—his heart long dominated by evil thoughts, wrong ideas, and unwholesome intentions—then, in terms of mental action, he is also harming himself. When body, speech, and mind are all primarily engaged in unwholesome actions, his overall behavior clearly proves that he does not truly love himself: even if he believes he loves himself, in fact he is harming himself through unwholesome conduct.

III. The Core Principle of Self-Protection and the Guarding Within and Without

III.1 Measuring Self-Protection by Wholesome and Unwholesome Conduct  
On the basis of self-love, self-protection becomes a further, central concept. If a person uses body, speech, and mind to perform wholesome actions, so that all three kinds of actions incline toward what is wholesome, then such behavior itself is a beneficial safeguarding of oneself. Through wholesome conduct, he not only avoids various unwholesome results, but also cultivates the causes and conditions for security, clarity, and happiness for himself. Thus it can be said that he is well protecting himself.  
On the other hand, if in body, speech, and mind he commits unwholesome actions, plunging body and mind deeply into what is unwholesome, then even if outwardly he appears to be pursuing benefit or pleasure, in reality he is damaging, destroying, and abandoning the protection of himself. Such unwholesome conduct is a form of not protecting oneself, even of pushing one’s own body and mind toward suffering and degeneration. From this it is clear that the wholesomeness or unwholesomeness of body, speech, and mind directly determines whether a person is protecting himself or harming himself.

III.2 The Difference between Inner Protection and Outer Protection  
When speaking of protection, people often associate it with various external forces, such as elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry—external protective forces that in the world are commonly regarded as symbols of protection, power, and security. However, no matter whether it is elephant troops, cavalry, chariots, or infantry, even if their formation is vast, they can only provide external and temporary defense, and cannot truly protect a person’s inner being and fundamental life.  
The power that can genuinely protect oneself actually comes from the wholesome actions of body, speech, and mind. When a person follows his own body, speech, and mental activity to perform wholesome deeds, these wholesome actions that proceed from within to without are the real inner protection. This inner protection does not rely on armies or force, but is based on the purity of the three actions, thereby bringing one genuine safety and security in this life and in the future. External protection cannot replace this inner protection; therefore, practitioners must understand that wholesome conduct of body, speech, and mind is the most fundamental and also the most reliable path of self-protection.

IV. The Universal Law of Self-Love and the Principle of Not Harming Others

IV.1 All Beings Take Themselves as What They Love Most  
From a broader perspective, self-love is not a special case of a single individual, but a psychological tendency common to all beings. In the depths of their hearts, every being considers that there is no one else more lovable or more worthy of cherishing than themselves. When weighing self and others in their hearts, beings always regard themselves as the side they most love and most do not wish to see suffer. This tendency exists universally among all beings.

IV.2 Deriving the Practice of Not Harming Others from Self-Love  
Precisely because all beings take themselves as what they love most, starting from this fact, in dealing with others and in one’s way of being in the world, one should not ignore this fundamental reality that others cherish themselves just as one cherishes oneself. Since everyone loves himself in this way, when facing others one should, taking self-love as the starting point, put oneself in their place and remember that they also do not wish to be harmed.  
Therefore, when living among others, one should ask oneself: since I do not wish to be harmed, I should not commit any actions that harm others. In other words, this universal law of self-love requires that in actual conduct we restrain all harm inflicted upon others, because if such harm were to fall upon ourselves, it would bring the same pain. From the fact that all beings love themselves, we can thus derive the basic principle for being a person: we should not harm others.

V. The Suffering and Enmity Brought by Victory and Defeat

V.1 The Negative Consequences of Winning and Losing  
In human relationships and worldly competition, victory and defeat are often regarded as signs of achievement or loss. Yet if we carefully observe the consequences that victory and defeat bring, we can see another dimension. When a person wins, although on the surface he may seem to have gained advantage or benefit, he often thereby creates resentful enemies—others who harbor resentment and hostility toward him in their hearts. This enmity born from victory gives the fruit of victory a hidden negative side.  
As for the one who is defeated, he falls into suffering. Because of his defeat, he cannot avoid feeling frustration, humiliation, and anxiety in his heart, to the point that he finds it hard to sleep at night—repeatedly chewing over the pain brought by defeat, unable to calm down for a long time. Thus, whether in victory or in defeat, there may accompany enmity and suffering, rather than purely glory or purely loss.

VI. Unwholesome Minds at the Three Times of Day and the Evil Ways that Lead to Hell

VI.1 The Concrete Content of Unwholesome Minds in Morning, Noon, and Evening  
In daily life, if during the three times of a day—morning, noon, and evening—one’s inner state is each dominated by what is unwholesome, this will form unwholesome patterns that lead to falling into hell. Among these, if in the morning a person abides at home with a mind of stinginess and greed, being extremely miserly with his own wealth and resources, unwilling to give or share, soaking the entire morning in thoughts of stinginess and greed, this is the first unwholesome mind.  
Next, during the middle of the day, if he abides at home with a mind of jealousy—harboring envy toward others’ achievements, wealth, or good fortune, never appreciating the good that others have, but only indulging in comparison and resentment—then spending the whole daytime in jealousy is the second unwholesome mind.  
By evening, if he again abides at home with a mind steeped in sensual desire, letting his thoughts sink into various sense pleasures and enjoyments, generating intense craving and attachment toward these desirable objects, and drifting through the entire evening in a mind stained by sensual lust, this is the third unwholesome mind. Morning stinginess and greed, midday jealousy, and evening lustful attachment—living in such a way that all three times of day are occupied by unwholesome mind-states—constitutes unwholesome patterns that lead to falling into hell, gradually driving body and mind toward the very heavy result of rebirth in unfortunate realms.

VII. The Mutual Fulfillment of Protecting Oneself and Protecting Others

VII.1 How Protecting Oneself Is Protecting Others, and Protecting Others Is Protecting Oneself  
In the full scope of practice, protecting oneself and protecting others are not two opposing matters, but are two aspects that fulfill one another and are in fact one and the same. If a person can truly protect and care for himself, he is in fact also protecting and caring for others; likewise, if he can truly protect and care for others, this will in the end also accomplish the protection of himself.  
Therefore, when practicing mindfulness, one should practice not only with the intention of self-protection—attending to the states of one’s own body, speech, and mind, and preventing inner heedlessness and degeneration—but should also practice mindfulness with the intention of protecting others, sensing the feelings and safety of others, and avoiding causing others to suffer through one’s own actions. Self-protection and protecting others should both be valued and implemented together in the practice of mindfulness.

VII.2 Achieving Protection of Others through the Practice of Self-Protection  
When a person puts practice into effect with the mindset of self-protection, he will continually “through practice” cultivate right mindfulness and right conduct. This practice is not an occasional effort, but is “through repeated practice,” whereby, through day-after-day repeated application, wholesome qualities become gradually firm within body and mind.  
As the practice of self-protection deepens, his afflictions, habits, and unwholesome behaviors become fewer and fewer, and his body, speech, and mind become increasingly pure and steady. Such a person, because his own behavior has already become upright, no longer harms himself or others through unwholesome conduct, and thus invisibly reduces the harm and pressure he exerts on others. In this way, practice that originally stemmed from self-protection naturally transforms into care and protection for others: through practice and repeated practice, self-protection fulfills the protection of others.

VII.3 Achieving Self-Protection through Virtuous Protection of Others  
On the other hand, if a person gives rise to the intention to protect others, he must rely on concrete virtues to carry out this caring protection. First, he must rely on patience: when facing the offenses of others or adverse circumstances, he is able to endure without hastily seeking revenge, and does not let anger and hatred dominate his actions. Such patience allows him, while protecting others, also to avoid falling into unwholesome conduct himself.  
Next, he should rely on non-harming, deliberately maintaining an attitude and behavior of not injuring others, so that his actions do not bring suffering to beings. Then, he must rely on loving-kindness, holding a sincere concern and goodwill toward beings, taking joy in their peace and happiness. Finally, he needs to rely on compassion, giving rise to a heart of pity toward the suffering of others and wishing to lessen their pain.  
When a person protects others on the basis of the above—patience, non-harming, loving-kindness, and compassion—he is not only practicing the protection of others, but is at the same time establishing purity of body, speech, and mind for himself, thus avoiding error and wrongdoing and accomplishing self-protection. In this way, protecting others becomes the cause of self-protection, and self-protection in turn supports the protection of others; the two are interwoven and inseparable.

VIII. The Universal Law of Distancing Oneself and the Rarity of Practitioners

VIII.1 The General Pattern: Few Can Distance Themselves, Many Cannot  
Regarding all the objects that should be distanced from, there exists a universal law. No matter which category of object is being discussed, so long as it is something that ought to be distanced from, the beings who can truly manage to distance themselves from it are few in number; in contrast, those who fail to distance themselves from these objects are many, with the majority of beings still remaining in a state of being unable to distance themselves.  
This situation—“few are those who can distance themselves; many are those who cannot”—does not occur only in isolated cases, but is a pattern that exists generally across various lists and categories. Regardless of how the objects are classified, this phenomenon appears repeatedly and widely.

VIII.2 The Broad Applicability of This Law to All Types of Objects  
The core law mentioned above—namely, that among objects that should be distanced from, those who distance themselves are few and those who have not distanced themselves are many—does not apply merely to one or two specific kinds of things, but applies universally to all the concrete objects in every category. For each concrete object, as long as it belongs to the kind that should be distanced from, the situation is thus: the practitioners who can truly distance themselves are always a minority, while those who cannot distance themselves are always the majority.  
From this it can be seen that, on the path of practice, those who are willing and able to distance themselves from what should be abandoned have always been a minority among minorities. This universal law reminds people that, if amidst the many who have not distanced themselves one can choose to become one of the few who truly do distance themselves, one thereby takes a crucial step on the path of self-love, self-protection, and the protection of others.
