I. Disorder in the Monastic Community and the True Meaning of Assembly

I.1 The Manifestations of Disorder in the Monastic Community

When a monastic community falls into disorder, its outward appearance clearly reflects its inner corruption. In such a Saṅgha, no one is any longer willing to show proper decorum and make respectful añjali to the community of monks. Some people only know how to pay homage to the emperor, yet are unwilling to turn to the Jewel of the Saṅgha with the same attitude of reverence, placing worldly power above the merit of spiritual practice. In this way, the Saṅgha becomes like an abandoned corpse cast aside with no one to claim it: no one cherishes it, no one protects it, and it completely loses the dignity and proper order it ought to possess.

I.2 The True Conditions of Assembly and of Good People

When speaking of an assembly, one must understand that a true assembly does not mean a mere gathering of numbers. If many people are collected in one place but no good people are present among them, such a gathering cannot be called an assembly in the true sense. Only when good people appear, and wholesome qualities can unfold among them—being jointly discussed, practiced, and protected—does such a gathering have genuine value and legitimate meaning.

II. Speech, Patience, and the Path to Victory

II.1 The Grave Offense and Consequences of Slandering Practitioners

Within the rules of practice and ethics, reviling those who are steady, harmonious, and diligent in cultivation is an extremely serious act. Such slander is not merely unwholesome verbal karma; it leads to exceedingly heavy results. According to the law of Dharma, if someone maliciously slanders these calm and steadfast practitioners, he will in the end fall into the Red Lotus Hell, enduring a hellish lifespan of great length and long-term suffering, difficult to escape. Thus it can be seen that carelessly injuring practitioners with one’s words brings consequences far exceeding the momentary thrill of having the sharper tongue.

II.2 The Foolish Behavior of the Ignorant

For those who are entirely unaware of, or do not understand, this law of cause and effect, great inversion manifests in their conduct and speech. In disputes or conflicts, they regard spewing harsh words, verbally injuring others, and even slandering them as a kind of victory: as if merely getting the upper hand or out-talking the other side meant superiority and success. Yet from the perspective of the Dharma, this attitude is precisely an expression of foolishness. They know nothing of the consequences brought by harsh speech, and are engrossed only in the immediate contest of winning and losing. They imagine they are gaining advantage, yet in fact they are deeply entangled in wrongdoing.

II.3 The Four Principles of Wholesome Speech and Faultless Words

In the regulations concerning speech, the “Four Principles of Wholesome Speech” are set forth as the standard for judging whether language is proper. Only speech that fulfills these four characteristics can be regarded as truly wholesome: it is legitimate, free of fault, and not subject to criticism or censure by the wise.

First, the speech itself must be wholesome and beautiful, not base, ugly, or vile.  
Second, its content must accord with the true Dharma and not run contrary to it.  
Third, the tone of speaking should be imbued with loving-kindness and grace, not rough, unfriendly, or hurtful, nor difficult for others to approach.  
Finally, what is spoken must be true and not false, not fabricated or deceptive, and certainly not used to mislead others into a wrong path by means of fraud.

Only when a person’s speech simultaneously possesses these four conditions—wholesome and beautiful, in accord with the Dharma, loving and graceful, and true and not false—can it truly be called wholesome speech, able to stand firm before the wise without incurring blame.

II.4 The Principle of Victory Through Patience and Its Twofold Benefit

In the face of conflict and opposition, patience is not cowardly retreat but a path of victory with clear principles and benefits. Acting according to the principle of victory through patience, one can win two victories at once. One victory is realized inwardly as clarity of mind and liberation; the other manifests outwardly as a harmonious resolution of circumstances and the cessation of hostile conditions. Such conduct benefits oneself and benefits others. Thus one can be said to be one’s own physician, able to heal one’s own afflictions and impulses, and at the same time a physician to others, who through one’s attitude and behavior can guide them away from wrongdoing and error.

II.5 Responding to Anger and to Fools

In the actual application of patience and of methods for restraint, the objects one faces are often the anger of others and the deeds of fools. Because fools do not understand the Dharma, and do not comprehend the causality of good and evil or the proper bounds of conduct, when someone attempts to restrain their unwholesome actions, they not only fail to reflect on themselves but may, instead, intensify their violent behavior—becoming even more ferocious and hard to manage.

In such situations, if one merely endures unilaterally and without limit, one may in fact encourage the fool’s arrogance and allow his evil deeds to continually escalate. Therefore, when the wise encounter the terrifying behavior of fools, they will at the appropriate time impose severe punishments or sanctions to put a stop to it. Such severity does not arise from revenge, but from the wish to prevent foolish conduct from further spreading and causing greater harm. If one only gives way without putting a stop to it, then in the absence of any restraint, the fool’s violent behavior will only grow more intense and finally lead to even greater disaster.

II.6 The Universal Principle of Harboring No Deceit

In all human dealings and in interactions with all beings, there is a law that must be remembered and practiced: the law of harboring no deceit. This principle stresses that, no matter whom one faces, one should not harbor a deceitful mind, and should not respond to anyone with trickery, calculation, or hypocrisy. This attitude of non-deceit has universal applicability: even an enemy is no exception. Even when dealing with those who oppose oneself, one should not take deceit and deception as one’s means, but must steadfastly uphold honesty and integrity. Only this accords with the codes of conduct required by the Dharma.

II.7 The Universality of These Principles and Their Historical Confirmation

Looking over all the foregoing principles, we can see that they are not confined to any one specific occasion; they possess broad universality. In particular, regarding ways of handling opposition and conflict, these principles can be applied to any kind of conflict situation. Whether it is a quarrel between individuals, a clash between groups, or opposition on a larger scale, as long as one acts in accordance with these principles, one can find an appropriate way out.

History repeatedly confirms that those who are able to persist in acting according to these principles often attain genuine victory and stability in the end. Their victory is not founded upon intrigue and brutality, but upon virtues gradually accumulated over a long time—uprightness, patience, and a mind free of deceit.

III. Gratitude, Appreciation, and Supporting Good Friends

III.1 The Core Practice of Gratitude and Thankfulness

In the inner cultivation of a practitioner, gratitude and thankfulness form an extremely important core principle. A practitioner should deliberately cultivate a mind that recognizes kindness, not forgetting the help and support received from others; at the same time, one must cultivate a sincere attitude of appreciation, mindfully remembering the benefits bestowed.

In concrete conduct, such gratitude and appreciation should not remain at the level of words alone, but should be implemented as a willingness to give to others—without fussing over gain and loss, and without taking the amount of return as a precondition or requirement. By learning and continuously practicing such an attitude, a practitioner can establish stable and pure wholesome connections within relationships.

III.2 The Content and Attitude of Lay Support for Practitioners

For lay believers who sincerely wish to support practitioners, offerings are not only acts of material giving; they are also expressions of inner intention and attitude. In concrete terms, lay supporters should provide practitioners with suitable clothing, so that in practice and daily life they can cover the body and keep warm; they should also supply the food and drink needed for daily sustenance, so that practitioners need not roam about in search of food and can peacefully concentrate on the path of Dharma.

In addition, they should prepare appropriate sitting and sleeping requisites, so that practitioners have basic support for rest and meditation; they should also supply the necessary medicines, so that when practitioners fall ill or feel unwell, they can receive needed treatment and care.

In terms of mindset, when lay followers witness a practitioner displaying extraordinary attainment, a natural reverence should arise within, with the understanding that this is the result of long-term cultivation and is not to be treated lightly. When making offerings, they should do so with a sincere heart, not for the sake of fame, gain, or other ulterior motives. Nor should they be enthusiastic only for a moment; rather, they should continue to support practitioners over time, so that the path of practice can be firmly sustained and the Dharma may long remain in the world.

III.3 Drawing Near to Good Friends and Bringing Honor to One’s Family

On the path of life, whether one draws near to good friends often has a far-reaching impact on one’s destiny and reputation. When a person can draw close to good friends, learn from them, and receive the influence of true Dharma and wholesome conduct, not only can he elevate his own character and wisdom, he can also bring honor to his relatives.

Because his behavior is upright and his virtues complete, he becomes within his family a person worthy of respect and praise, causing his household to shine. Such honor brought to the family does not arise from power and wealth, but springs naturally from association with good friends and from conduct in harmony with the true Dharma.

IV. Authority and Those Who Must Not Be Despised

IV.1 The General Applicability of Authority Surpassing Mere Appearance

When observing living beings—whether animals or humans—one can see a shared principle: what truly inspires awe is often not outward appearance and physical size, but inner power and authority. In the animal realm, such creatures as geese, egrets, peacocks, elephants, and spotted deer feel awe when facing a lion, not because the lion’s body is especially enormous, but because of the inner majesty and authority the lion possesses, which instinctively strikes other animals with fear and respect.

Similarly, in the human world, a young person endowed with wisdom has worth and influence far exceeding that of someone tall and powerfully built yet foolish and ignorant. This shows that the true basis for respect and trust is wisdom and inner virtue, not merely the grandeur of outer appearance or the strength of physique.

IV.2 Three Objects Not to Be Despised and Their Consequences

In the moral precepts, three kinds of persons or situations are listed as not to be despised, as a warning to prevent serious consequences arising from negligence.

First is a young kṣatriya. Although he is still young and not yet mature, he is born into a noble class and may already possess considerable reputation and influence. If someone, on account of his youth, despises, humiliates, or neglects him, then when he later ascends the throne and holds power, he may, out of anger and resentment, impose harsh punishments, bringing irreparable retribution upon those who slighted him.

Second is a small snake. No matter how slender its body may appear, or how insignificant its appearance, one must never look down on it as harmless. Snakes are innately venomous; if a foolish person, out of carelessness, draws near, he may be bitten at once and poisoned and harmed.

Third is a small flame. Once a fire is already burning, even if the flame seems tiny and only a little black smoke is rising, one must not relax one’s vigilance for that reason. Fire is by nature greedy and devouring, ever consuming fuel. Once it receives sufficient wood and combustible material, it can quickly flare up into a great blaze and spread into a conflagration. If a foolish person disregards the danger and rashly approaches, he may immediately be burned by the flames and suffer serious injury.

From these three situations, we see that despising things that appear weak or have not yet fully manifested their potential often leads to losses and suffering that cannot be remedied.

V. Mindful Eating and the Body’s Benefit

V.1 The Basic Principles and Benefits of Mindful Eating

In caring for body and mind, food is an extremely crucial factor. According to the basic principles of diet, if one approaches eating with mindfulness and carefully adjusts both the amount and manner of intake, multiple concrete benefits can be obtained. Mindful eating can effectively reduce physical suffering, preventing the body from bearing excessive burdens due to improper diet. It can also slow the process of aging, so that as the years increase, one’s physical condition remains relatively better. Furthermore, by regulating diet according to such principles, one can lengthen the span of life, allowing it to be extended and one’s state of health to become more stable.

V.2 The Process of Practice and Personal Verification

In practical terms, mindful eating is not a drastic overnight change but a gradual adjustment through which one slowly discovers the amount and degree of restraint most suitable to oneself. As time goes on and one’s diet gradually approaches a proper measure, the state of the body will undergo evident improvement. The body becomes healthier than before; discomforts or feelings of heaviness that used to arise easily will be reduced. This improvement is not mere conjecture, but a fact that can be verified through personal experience. As practitioners tangibly feel their health improving through bodily changes, they become all the more convinced of the correctness and necessity of these dietary principles.

V.3 The Twofold Benefit in This Life and in the Future

The benefits brought by such dietary principles are not limited to the body’s present condition. In this present life, they directly improve health, reduce illness and pain, and raise the quality of daily living. For the future, they also bring long-term benefits: through sustained restraint and mindfulness, body and mind accumulate wholesome causes, and thus in future lives or states of existence, one obtains corresponding good results. Therefore, mindful eating yields a twofold benefit, embracing both this life and the future.

VI. The Path of Self-Reliance and the Lesson of Unfilial Children

VI.1 The Plight Caused by Unfilial Children

In human relationships, one of the most heartbreaking situations is that of unfilial children who, together with their spouses, persecute their own father. When a father is advanced in years and ought to receive care and support, such children instead conspire with their spouses to drive the aged father out of the house, depriving him of shelter and reliance. Once expelled from his home, the old father falls into poverty and has no means to sustain his life, forced to beg everywhere merely to scrape by. This situation reveals the cruelty of unfilial conduct, in which an elder is cast aside like a worn-out rag precisely when he most needs support.

VI.2 The Principle of Self-Reliance and Depending on One’s Own Strength

In the face of such unfilial children, the Dharma sets forth a path of self-reliance, emphasizing the importance of depending on one’s own strength. Rather than relying on children who are unwilling to fulfill their filial duty, it is better to depend on one’s own abilities or on tools as reliable as a staff in the hand. One’s own strength and reliable aids can provide many kinds of concrete assistance in daily life.

For example, when encountering a dangerous bull or a fierce dog, with one’s own strength or with a staff in hand one can drive these dangers away and protect oneself. While walking in darkness, a staff can provide guidance, serving as supportive reliance in moving forward, preventing one from stumbling or being injured by unseen obstacles. When crossing a deep stream, a staff can become a firm point of support, helping stabilize the body so one can pass safely through the rushing water. If one should accidentally fall, one can again use the staff’s support to stand up by its strength. Such specific functions illustrate how relying on one’s own power and on trustworthy tools can truly play a practical role in various dangers.

VI.3 The Contrast Between Unworthy Descendants and a Reliable Staff

By contrast, those unworthy descendants, though called a father’s sons in name, in their behavior are as cruel and merciless as yakṣas. They abandon their aged father without providing care and even drive him out of the door. Their treatment of him is like dealing with an old, feeble horse: seeing no further use for it, they are unwilling even to provide basic food, leaving their father to cling to life amid hunger and hardship.

Sons of this kind are far inferior in value to a single reliable staff in one’s hand. A staff can at least protect one in times of danger, offer direction in darkness, and assist one to stand up when one has fallen; unworthy descendants only bring harm and abandonment. Thus, in practical life, it is better to rely on a truly dependable staff than on such sons.

VI.4 Choosing One’s Reliance When Facing Unfilial Children

Therefore, when facing unfilial children, instead of placing excessive expectations and reliance upon them, one should choose to rely on oneself, or on tools and strengths that are as dependable as a staff. One’s own abilities and reliable aids can provide genuine protection in danger, proper guidance, and concrete support. Such reliance far surpasses placing one’s hope in unworthy descendants who only bring suffering and deprivation. From this contrast, people can clearly see the necessity of self-reliance and the danger of depending on unfilial children, and thus make more lucid and secure choices.

VII. A Correct Understanding of Magic and Illusory Arts

VII.1 The Boundary Between Knowing and Performing

When discussing magic and illusory arts, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between “knowing” and “performing.” Merely knowing that such arts exist, or understanding their principles or forms, is not the same as actually performing them. Pure knowledge by itself does not constitute a fault or offense. The real fault lies in the act of performing such magic—that is, in using these arts to deceive or confuse others or to achieve improper aims.

Therefore, when judging whether there is wrongdoing, one must assess whether the act has actually been carried out in practice, and should not mistakenly regard mere knowledge and intellectual understanding as equivalent to having committed the deed.
