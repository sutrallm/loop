I. The Activation of Right Wisdom and the Fundamental Objects of Observation  
I.1 The Relationship Between Right Wisdom and the Five Aggregates  
When a practitioner uses right wisdom to observe body and mind, the first step is to establish the objects of observation upon the five aggregates. These five aggregates are form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. Form includes all material forms and phenomena related to the body; feeling is the feelings that arise toward objects; perception is the function of marking and recognizing things; formations are the various volitions, fabrications, and mental activities; consciousness is the mental activity that discerns and knows various objects. Using right wisdom as the tool means to illuminate these form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness clearly and as they really are, without allowing them to become vague, confused, or overlooked.  

I.2 Comprehensive Observation of All Form, Feeling, Perception, Formations, and Consciousness  
In such observation, it is not merely a rough understanding of the five aggregates; one must observe all states and appearances of every form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness. “All” means that whatever belongs to the aggregate of form, whether large or small, bright or dark, tangible or intangible; whatever belongs to the aggregate of feeling, whether painful or pleasant, sorrowful or joyful, or neither painful nor pleasant; whatever belongs to the aggregate of perception, whether clear or vague, strong or weak; whatever belongs to the aggregate of formations, whether brief or lasting, wholesome, unwholesome, or mixed; whatever belongs to the aggregate of consciousness, namely any knowing activity that arises in any realm— all should be brought within the scope of observation. To observe with right wisdom is to leave out no aspect whatsoever, placing every appearance of the five aggregates under clear seeing as they really are.  

II. Observing the Changes of the Five Aggregates in the Dimension of Time  
II.1 Past States of the Five Aggregates  
In the dimension of time, right wisdom first guides the practitioner to look back on all past phenomena related to the five aggregates. Past form includes bodily states and various material forms that have already arisen and ceased; past feeling is the various feelings that once arose but are no longer present; past perception is the past activities of memory, marking, and recognition regarding people and things; past formations are volitions, choices, and various mental fabrications that have already been initiated and completed; past consciousness is the various modes of mind that knew objects at that time. Although these past form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are no longer present, they still must be reviewed as they really were with right wisdom and brought into the field of observation.  

II.2 Possible Future Five Aggregates  
Next, observation also encompasses the dimension of the future five aggregates. Future form is bodily and material states that have not yet appeared but may arise; future feeling is the painful, pleasant, sorrowful, joyful, and neutral feelings that may be experienced; future perception is the future activities of attention to and marking of objects; future formations are volitions and fabrications that have not yet occurred but may be initiated; future consciousness is the knowing activity that may arise in the future under various conditions of dependent origination. All these future states related to the five aggregates are to be examined as they really are within the observation of right wisdom.  

II.3 Present Manifestation of the Five Aggregates  
In the present moment, right wisdom places particular emphasis on the direct observation of the five aggregates that are now manifest. Present form is the current state of the body and all material environments at this very moment; present feeling is the painful feelings, pleasant feelings, sorrowful feelings, joyful feelings, and neutral feelings that are currently being experienced; present perception is the memory, recognition, and marking that are being made toward the present objects; present formations are the volitions, decisions, habits, and various mental drives that are operating right now; present consciousness is the awareness and discernment of all internal and external objects that is currently manifest. To observe the present five aggregates with right wisdom is to know and see clearly and without dullness the totality of the body‑mind activities occurring right now as they really are.  

III. Observing the Five Aggregates in Terms of Internal and External Dimensions  
III.1 Observation of the Internal Five Aggregates  
Observation is distinguished not only in terms of time but also in terms of internal and external dimensions. “Internal” refers to all form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness related to oneself. Internal form is one’s own body and the material phenomena closely connected with it; internal feeling is the various feelings that one actually experiences in body and mind; internal perception is the memories, concepts, and functions of recognition that arise in one’s own mind; internal formations are the intentions, decisions, habits, and fabrications within one’s own mind; internal consciousness is one’s own knowing and awareness of body‑mind and external objects. All of these internal five aggregates are objects that must be clearly illuminated when observed with right wisdom.  

III.2 Observation of the External Five Aggregates  
At the same time, observation must be extended to the “external” dimension. External form is all material phenomena and external forms outside oneself; external feeling can be the inferred painful, pleasant, sorrowful, joyful, and neutral feelings experienced by other beings, or the general patterns of feeling phenomena in the world as seen with right wisdom; external perception is the memory and marking activities that others or sentient beings generate toward objects; external formations are the phenomena that appear as volitions, actions, and mental fabrications in the external world; external consciousness is the knowing and cognitive activity by which beings are aware of various objects. The application of right wisdom is not confined to one’s own body and mind; it can also clearly observe and apprehend as they really are all external phenomena of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness.  

IV. Observing the Coarse and Subtle Qualities of the Five Aggregates  
IV.1 Salient Features of the Coarse Five Aggregates  
In terms of quality, the five aggregates can also be observed from the two aspects of coarse and subtle. The coarse aspect usually refers to more obvious and easily noticeable states. For example, the coarse aspect of the form aggregate is the clearly visible and tangible body and material forms; the coarse aspect of the feeling aggregate is intense painful or pleasant feelings and prominent sorrow or joy; the coarse aspect of the perception aggregate is clear and strong memories or conceptual markings; the coarse aspect of the formations aggregate is obvious intentions, strong emotions, and immediate urges to act; the coarse aspect of the consciousness aggregate is vivid and intense awareness of objects. These coarse states of the five aggregates should first be observed as they really are under right wisdom, without being overlooked or misunderstood.  

IV.2 Subtle Levels of the Five Aggregates  
In contrast to the coarse and obvious, the subtle aspect refers to more delicate and hard‑to‑notice levels. The subtle aspect of the form aggregate may be very small changes in bodily or material states that are difficult to perceive directly; the subtle aspect of the feeling aggregate is extremely slight feelings, those minute sensations that lie between clear pleasure and clear pain; the subtle aspect of the perception aggregate is memories and concepts that flash quickly through the mind, not necessarily clear yet still present; the subtle aspect of the formations aggregate is deep‑seated habits, latent tendencies, and mental fabrications that have not yet become obviously manifest; the subtle aspect of the consciousness aggregate is extremely fine and fleeting moments of awareness. In observation with right wisdom, one must not only notice coarse phenomena but also maintain clear awareness of these subtle activities of the five aggregates, so that both the coarse and the subtle levels are completely unmissed.  

V. Observing Higher and Lower Quality States of the Five Aggregates  
V.1 The Manifestation of Inferior Five‑Aggregate States  
On the level of quality or value, the five aggregates can also be divided into inferior and superior states. Inferior states are usually relatively low, unwholesome, or unfavorable expressions of the five aggregates. The inferior state of the form aggregate may be impure, decayed, or unattractive bodily and material conditions; the inferior state of the feeling aggregate is feelings associated with the afflictions of greed, hatred, and delusion, or feeling experiences that give rise to unwholesome results; the inferior state of the perception aggregate is mistaken memory, inverted marking, and irrational modes of cognition; the inferior state of the formations aggregate is volitions, habits, and fabrications that bring about afflictions and unwholesome actions; the inferior state of the consciousness aggregate is knowing that is tainted by ignorance and afflictions. All these inferior phenomena of the five aggregates are clearly recognized under the illumination of right wisdom, without being rationalized or concealed.  

V.2 The Manifestation of Superior Five‑Aggregate States  
In contrast to the inferior is the superior state. Superior five aggregates refer to expressions that are relatively pure, excellent, or wholesome. The superior state of the form aggregate is a body and material condition that is more stable, dignified, and conducive to practice; the superior state of the feeling aggregate is feelings associated with renunciation, compassion, and wisdom, or feeling experiences that can give rise to wholesome qualities and a purified mind; the superior state of the perception aggregate is correct memory, rational marking, and cognition that accords with truth; the superior state of the formations aggregate is volitions and fabrications that lead toward wholesome qualities, purity, and liberation; the superior state of the consciousness aggregate is awareness associated with right view, right understanding, and right mindfulness. When observing with right wisdom, one must also know and see these superior five‑aggregate phenomena as they really are, neither exaggerating nor belittling them, clearly distinguishing between inferior and superior so that the mind is no longer confused.  

VI. Observing the Five Aggregates in Terms of Space and Distance  
VI.1 Contemplation of Distant Five‑Aggregate Phenomena  
On the level of distance, the five aggregates can also be divided into the two ranges of far and near. “Far” refers to five‑aggregate phenomena that are relatively distant in terms of spatial distance or relationship. Distant form may be the material world and bodily forms in far‑off places; distant feeling is the various feelings experienced by beings in other places or by those who are only distantly related to oneself; distant perception is memory and cognitive activity arising elsewhere, not in the present locale; distant formations are the volitions and behavioral fabrications that beings in distant regions initiate within different environments; distant consciousness is the awareness and knowing that arise in the minds of beings far removed from oneself. When observing the five aggregates with right wisdom, one is not limited to what is before one’s eyes or immediately around, but in understanding and contemplation also includes distant five‑aggregate phenomena within reflection and appreciation.  

VI.2 Manifestation of Nearby Five‑Aggregate Phenomena  
Opposed to what is far is the near range. Nearby form is the bodily states and material forms right beside one or closely related to oneself; nearby feeling is the feelings that oneself and nearby beings are currently or about to experience; nearby perception is memory and cognitive activity that are more directly related to this present time and place; nearby formations are the volitions and fabrications manifested by oneself and nearby beings in the present environment; nearby consciousness is the awareness activity occurring right now in this space that bears a closer relationship to oneself. The observation of right wisdom is even more direct and obvious with regard to nearby five aggregates, because these five‑aggregate phenomena that are right before one’s eyes are the easiest to clearly notice and experience.  

VII. Using Right Wisdom to Comprehensively Observe All Aspects of the Five Aggregates  
VII.1 Not Omitting Any Aspect of the Five Aggregates  
In summary, to observe the five aggregates with right wisdom is to illuminate as they really are all aspects of all form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, in a comprehensive and unfragmented way. This “all aspects” includes the past, future, and present in terms of time; it also includes the distinction between internal and external; at the same time it attends to both coarse and subtle levels; it clearly differentiates inferior and superior qualities; and it further brings within observation all differences of distance between far and near. Whatever forms and appearances the five aggregates may take, no matter how they are classified or how they present themselves, they should all be brought under the contemplation of right wisdom, with no situation whatsoever being neglected or lost.  

VII.2 The Integrating Function of Right Wisdom in Observation  
In this process of observation, right wisdom plays the role of integration and guidance. It does not look at only one portion of the five aggregates in a scattered way; rather, under the same clear and truthful wisdom, it enables the practitioner to simultaneously understand the changes of the five aggregates in past, future, and present; their manifestations on the internal and external levels; their appearance at different depths of coarse and subtle; their distinctions in the two qualities of inferior and superior; and their distribution at varying distances of far and near. Through right wisdom, all these seemingly scattered aspects of the five aggregates can be integrated within a single field of contemplation, so that the practitioner attains a complete and all‑pervading understanding of all phenomena of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness as they really are, no longer limited to partial or fragmentary knowledge.
