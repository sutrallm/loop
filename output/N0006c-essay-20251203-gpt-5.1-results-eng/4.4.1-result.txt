<title> The Core Principles of Freedom from Suffering, Attainment of Happiness, and the Victory of the True Dharma </title>
<article>
I. Core Principles and the Practice of Freedom from Suffering and Attainment of Happiness  
I.1 Taking Freedom from Suffering and the Attainment of Happiness as the Fundamental Orientation  
This core principle takes “the practice of freeing oneself from suffering and attaining happiness” as its fundamental orientation. That is to say, one’s entire cultivation and conduct are carried out around the question of how to escape suffering and obtain peace and happiness. Freedom from suffering and the attainment of happiness are not only the final result, but also the guiding principle that runs through the entire path; only practices that accord with this can truly embody the spirit of this core principle.

I.2 Bringing All Practice under the Guidance of the Core Principle  
Under such a core principle, all of a practitioner’s thoughts and choices take freedom from suffering and the attainment of happiness as their ultimate reference point. This means that every specific precept and every concrete action must be understood and examined within this principle, so that one’s practice does not deviate from the fundamental direction, but can always return to the actual implementation of freedom from suffering and the attainment of happiness.

II. Principles of Practice: Wholesome Precepts and Codes of Conduct  
II.1 The Requirements for Practicing Wholesome Precepts  
With respect to the principles of practice, the practitioner is required personally to put wholesome precepts into practice. Saying that “one must personally practice wholesome precepts” emphasizes that this is not a matter of merely conceptual or verbal assent, but of implementing them one by one in the concrete actions of body, speech, and mind in daily life, in conformity with the wholesome precepts. Whether an action is wholesome is to be measured and adjusted by using the precepts as the standard, so that one truly acts in accordance with them.

II.2 Taking the Principle as the Basis for All Actions  
While practicing the precepts, one must also “act in accordance with this principle.” The “this principle” referred to here is precisely the fundamental principle described above, which takes freedom from suffering and the attainment of happiness as its core. Practitioners must not only observe the precepts in outward form, but must also make this principle the basis and standard for all their actions. In other words, the initiation, process, and outcome of every action should accord with the core orientation of freedom from suffering and the attainment of happiness, so that the principles of practice become not merely external regulations, but the true inner support for one’s choices of conduct.

III. The Meaning of the True Dharma and of Victory  
III.1 The Victory that Comes from Following the True Dharma  
In the overall outline of the principles, one core principle is highlighted in particular: as long as one “acts in accordance with the true Dharma, one can obtain victory.” This makes it clear that whether one’s undertakings succeed does not ultimately depend on tactics or external conditions, but on whether one truly acts in accord with the true Dharma. So long as a person can, in concrete deeds, uphold the true Dharma and take it as the basis for action, they can thereby obtain a victorious outcome.

III.2 The Ultimate Peace Encompassed by Victory  
However, the “victory” spoken of here is not merely the narrow, superficial outcome of “defeating an opponent.” It is emphasized in particular that victory “does not only mean defeating an opponent, but also includes attaining ultimate peace and stability.” Thus, the victory obtained through the true Dharma is a deeper and more complete state. It encompasses both the outward situation of opponents being overcome and the inward state in which body and mind, and even one’s overall circumstances, move toward ultimate peace. Defeating opponents is only one aspect of victory; the truly complete meaning of victory lies in reaching that final, unshakable peace.

IV. The Concrete Effects Produced by Practicing the True Dharma  
IV.1 How Steadfast Adherence to the True Dharma Inspires Fear in Opponents  
When discussing the concrete details of putting the principles into practice, the text further points out certain evident effects of practicing the true Dharma. One such effect is that “steadfast adherence to the true Dharma causes opponents to feel fear.” That is to say, when a person can consistently and unwaveringly act in accordance with the true Dharma, this firm practice itself becomes a kind of power that causes those who face them to feel fear. Opponents feel fear not because of external intimidation or violence, but because, before the true Dharma, they themselves are aware that they lack right reason and that their conduct is improper, and thus they naturally experience fear.

IV.2 Opponents Withdraw of Their Own Accord Out of Fear of the True Dharma  
Because “out of fear of the true Dharma, opponents will withdraw of their own accord,” such fear is not merely an inner feeling, but will further be expressed in action. When opponents confront someone who steadfastly upholds the true Dharma, they are unable to oppose them in a legitimate way, and, fearing the legitimacy and power represented by the true Dharma, can only choose to yield, ultimately resulting in a situation where they retreat of their own accord. This withdrawal is precisely one of the concrete effects produced by holding fast to the true Dharma, and it echoes the previously mentioned result of obtaining victory and peace by relying on the true Dharma.
