<title> Correct Understanding of Value and the Nobility, Merit, and Harmony in Human Relationships </title>
<article>
I. The True Standard of Nobility and Value  
In people’s judgments about nobility and value, it is easy to stay at a superficial level, so we must first clarify the true standard of measurement. Among all beings that walk on two legs, the most noble is the one who is already awakened. By awakening, such a person transcends ordinary emotions and attachments, and is therefore regarded as the most noble among two‑footed beings. Among all beings that walk on four legs, the most excellent is the fine and noble horse: good in temperament, strong in body, and capable of bearing heavy responsibilities. It is regarded as the best representative among four‑footed beings.

Looking further at the family and intimate relationships: among all wives, the most virtuous is the one with a gentle and compliant disposition, who can respond to her partner and family with mildness and softness; such a wife is regarded as the most virtuous. Among all children, the most excellent are those who understand how to be filial to their parents, who serve them with a filial heart and repay the kindness of being raised; such children are regarded as exemplary among sons and daughters. From this we can see that, whether speaking of sentient beings, spouses, or children, true nobility and superiority do not lie in appearance or ability themselves, but in inner awakening, goodness, gentleness, and filial devotion.

II. Proper Use of Wealth and Obstacles to Merit  

II.1 The Proper Recipients for the Use of Wealth  
Once the standard of nobility and value has been established, we must also reflect on how wealth should be used so as to accord with what is proper and meaningful. The use of wealth is not merely for personal enjoyment; it also involves appropriate allocation among various recipients.

First, wealth should be reasonably used on oneself, to maintain one’s own livelihood and basic stability. Second, it should be used to support one’s parents, by repaying their nurturing grace with real material resources. Third, wealth should also be used to care for one’s wife, so that family life can be stable and the marital relationship well secured.

Beyond the family, wealth should be used to care for male servants, attendants, and others who work for one and perform labor, providing them with appropriate treatment and basic security in life so that their work is supported. In addition, wealth should be used for one’s friends, offering assistance or sharing within reasonable limits in order to sustain friendship and mutual help. On the spiritual and moral level, wealth should also be given in alms and offerings to śramaṇas and brahmins—practitioners and religious persons—to support their cultivation and their work of teaching, so that wholesome teachings may be preserved and spread. In this way, the recipients of wealth’s use include oneself, one’s parents, one’s wife, one’s male servants and attendants, one’s friends, and śramaṇas and brahmins, forming a complete and orderly scope of application.

II.2 The Obstacle to Merit Created by a Break in Wealth Transmission  
However, if wealth is not properly arranged, it can also create obstacles with respect to one’s store of merit. One such obstacle arises when the line of transmission is broken. If a person has no offspring to inherit his property, then after his death there will be no descendants to take over and make good use of that wealth, and in the end it will be confiscated into the royal treasury. In such a situation, wealth cannot be carried forward through relatives and descendants to become long‑term resources of merit. The direction in which the wealth flows is no longer the result of the person’s own voluntary giving or wise arrangement, but is instead passively absorbed into the royal coffers. This break in transmission becomes an obstacle that makes it difficult for one’s merit to continue and expand.

III. Principles and Meritorious Benefits of Supporting One’s Parents  

III.1 Right Livelihood and Ways of Supporting One’s Parents  
Among all human relationships, supporting one’s parents is a basic duty, and the starting point for practicing filial piety lies in the purity and righteousness of one’s means of livelihood. For those who wish to support their parents, they should seek what they need for living through proper and lawful means, and must not rely on unjust, illegal, or exploitative ways of amassing wealth that benefit oneself at others’ expense. Only income obtained through right livelihood is suitable to serve as the resources for supporting one’s parents. Using such open and upright earnings to provide for one’s parents is the way of filial support that accords with both morality and law.

III.2 The Rightness of Filial Conduct  
Using rightful income to support one’s parents is not only an emotional repayment, but in essence a correct action that ought to be carried out. To support one’s parents in this way is a choice that accords with ethics and true principles. It involves no fault at all; rather, it is a responsibility that one must assume. Looking at the action in itself, such filial support is worthy of affirmation—something that naturally should be done and must not be neglected.

III.3 The Meritorious Benefits of Supporting One’s Parents in This Life  
Supporting one’s parents is not only an expression of personal character; it also brings tangible wholesome results and evaluations in this very life. When a person earns a living by rightful means and uses that wealth to support his parents, the wise in this world will praise such conduct. They will recognize this filial behavior and regard it as a model worthy of learning and emulation. Thus, one who supports his parents can, in this present life, obtain the commendation of the wise and a good reputation; this is one of the meritorious benefits that filial piety brings in this world.

III.4 The Meritorious Fruits of Supporting One’s Parents in Future Lives  
Beyond praise in this life, supporting one’s parents will also ripen into excellent merit in future lives. When a person uses rightful wealth to provide for his parents and earnestly fulfills his filial duty, then at the end of his life this wholesome karma will become a powerful supporting condition for his rebirth, enabling him to be reborn in the heavenly realms and attain a purer and more sublime mode of existence. Thus we can see that supporting one’s parents is not only a responsibility to be fulfilled in this life, but also a path that can lead one toward the heavenly realms of good destination.

IV. The Conditions for Mutual Agreeableness Between Partners  

IV.1 Five Conditions of Agreeableness Common to Men and Women  
In human relationships—especially in relationships between male and female partners—whether both sides can be mutually satisfied and pleased with each other depends on certain conditions that can serve as criteria. For both men and women, there are some shared qualities that can make them find each other agreeable and suitable.

First, physical attractiveness is a condition that arouses joy and fondness in the other; a good appearance often enhances mutual attraction. Second, possessing property signifies the ability to sustain life and shoulder responsibilities, which is also an important foundation in a partnership.

Furthermore, having moral discipline—that is, possessing good conduct and ethical restraint—is one of the key conditions for maintaining a long‑term relationship. A person with moral discipline does not indulge in misconduct or do evil, and can make the other feel at ease. In addition, being diligent rather than lazy is also a shared trait that makes a person agreeable: being willing to work hard at managing life and family is far more likely to earn the partner’s trust than idleness and procrastination. Lastly, the ability to bear children for one’s partner concerns the continuation of the family and the transmission of the lineage, and in many relationships it is regarded as an important, shared expectation.

When both man and woman possess these five conditions—good looks, ownership of property, moral discipline, diligence rather than laziness, and the ability to bear children for the other—then they are more likely to value and delight in one another, becoming mutually agreeable partners.
