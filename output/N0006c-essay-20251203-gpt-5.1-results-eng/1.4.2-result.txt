I. The Basic Meaning and Types of Feeling  

I.1 Definition of Feeling  

What is called “feeling” (vedanā) is every experiential impression that arises based on contact. These feelings arise dependent on both internal and external contact. Wherever faculty, object, and consciousness come together to form contact, feeling arises from that. According to the doctrine, all feelings that arise from contact can be summarized into three major types: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. These three types of feeling can arise from six kinds of contacts: feeling born of eye-contact, of ear-contact, of nose-contact, of tongue-contact, of body-contact, and of mind-contact. From another perspective, all feelings taken together are called the “aggregate of feeling” (feeling-aggregate), whose nature is like foam upon water—arising and ceasing in an instant, without any real substance.  

I.2 The Nature of the Three Types of Feeling  

Among the three types of feeling, pleasant feeling is an agreeable, enjoyable experience; painful feeling is an unpleasant, disagreeable experience; neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is a neutral experience that is neither agreeable nor disagreeable. The doctrine clearly points out that feelings can be divided not only into pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant, but that all three share a common characteristic: every kind of feeling is impermanent and constantly changing. If one can see clearly, as it really is, that pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings are all impermanent, then one will not generate attachment and craving toward any feeling whatsoever. When a noble disciple experiences pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings, they understand as it really is that these feelings are impermanent, not to be clung to, not to be delighted in; thus, at the very moment feelings arise, they experience disconnection and liberation, no longer treating feeling as something reliable or worth grasping.  

I.3 The Dual Division of Feeling: Bodily Feeling and Mental Feeling  

Besides the threefold division, feelings can also be divided according to the level on which they are based: bodily feeling and mental feeling. Bodily feeling is the feeling that arises based on the body; it is the bodily experience produced by contact between the body-faculty and external conditions, including bodily pleasure, comfort, pain, or discomfort. Mental feeling is the feeling that arises based on the mind; it is the mental experience produced by contact between the mind-faculty and its objects, including mental happiness, ease, sorrow, depression, and even states that are neither agreeable nor disagreeable. This dual classification does not contradict the threefold division, but describes the same set of feeling phenomena from a different angle.  

I.4 The Relationship Between Feeling and the Five Faculties  

On a more refined level, feeling can be expressed as five functional capacities, called the five feeling-faculties: the pleasure-faculty, the pain-faculty, the joy-faculty, the grief-faculty, and the equanimity-faculty. The pleasure-faculty refers to bodily pleasure and comfort, feelings of pleasure and agreeableness born of bodily contact. The pain-faculty refers to bodily pain and discomfort, feelings of pain and disagreeableness born of bodily contact. The joy-faculty is mental happiness and ease, feelings of pleasure and agreeableness born of mental contact. The grief-faculty is mental sorrow and dejection, feelings of pain and disagreeableness born of mental contact. The equanimity-faculty is bodily or mental feeling that is neither agreeable nor disagreeable—a state of calm equanimity. These five faculties can be summarized into the three types of feeling: the pleasure-faculty and the joy-faculty belong to pleasant feeling; the pain-faculty and the grief-faculty belong to painful feeling; and the equanimity-faculty belongs to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Conversely, the three types of feeling can be unfolded into these five faculties; they correspond to each other and are not in conflict.  

II. The Dependent Origination Relationship Between Feeling and Contact  

II.1 From Name-and-Form and the Six Contacts to Feeling  

The arising of feeling must depend on the body, name-and-form, and their interactive process. When beings rely on the body and interact with external name-and-form, contact arises, and from this the six kinds of contact-bases are formed: eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact. With these six contact-bases, beings are able, through any one of them, to actually experience various feelings such as pleasure and pain. Therefore, contact is an indispensable condition for the arising of feeling.  

II.2 The Six Contact-Bases and the Six Feelings  

There is a direct correspondence between feeling and the six contact-bases. Feeling born of eye-contact is the feeling elicited when the eye-faculty contacts visible forms; feeling born of ear-contact is the feeling that arises when the ear-faculty contacts sounds; feeling born of nose-contact is the feeling that arises when the nose-faculty contacts odors; feeling born of tongue-contact is the feeling that arises when the tongue-faculty contacts flavors; feeling born of body-contact is the feeling that arises when the body-faculty contacts tangibles; and feeling born of mind-contact is the feeling that arises when the mind-faculty contacts mental objects (dharmas). The feelings born of these six contact-bases are collectively called the six feelings. They are identical to all the pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings previously mentioned that arise from eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-contact. As long as faculty, object, and consciousness converge to form contact, corresponding feelings will inevitably arise.  

II.3 The Law of Feeling’s Arising and Ceasing Based on Contact  

All feelings arise dependent on contact and also cease dependent on contact. Different contacts give rise to different feelings; without contact, no feelings will arise at all. This contact itself is impermanent, fabricated, and dependently arisen; therefore, all feelings born of contact have the same dependent and impermanent nature. Specifically, pleasant feeling arises dependent on pleasant contact, and when pleasant contact ceases, the corresponding pleasant feeling also ceases. Painful feeling arises dependent on painful contact, and when painful contact ceases, painful feeling ceases. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises dependent on neutral contact, and when this neutral contact ceases, the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling also stops. In short, all feelings take contact as their fundamental and immediate condition, and also as their supporting condition; different feelings depend on their corresponding contacts in order to arise, and when these corresponding contacts cease, the related feelings cease altogether. Thus, the arising and cessation of feelings fully follow the universal principle of “arising dependent on conditions, ceasing dependent on conditions.”  

II.4 Contact as Nutriment and Feeling  

Among the four kinds of nutriment, contact-as-nutriment holds a special place. The nature of contact-as-nutriment is precisely the contact produced by the convergence of faculty, object, and consciousness, which then gives rise to feelings. Through such contact-as-nutriment, one can discern the three types of feeling—pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. When a noble disciple directly understands, as it really is, the dependent arising and cessation of contact and feeling, and no longer clings to or is bound by any feelings born of contact, they arrive at a state where there is nothing further to be done in this matter—indicating that they have reached complete liberation here.  

III. The Role of Feeling in Dependent Origination and the Flow of Life  

III.1 Craving Has Feeling as Its Root  

In the sequential order of the twelve links of dependent origination, feeling is an extremely crucial link. Craving (taṇhā) is the key force that leads to the continuation of life and saṃsāra, and the root of craving is precisely feeling. Craving takes feeling as its fundamental cause, root, origin, and starting point; that is, because there is feeling, craving and attachment to feeling arise. Especially when experiencing pleasant feeling, beings easily generate delight and attachment toward it, thereby forming intense craving. Even in the face of painful and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings, they may, through resistance, aversion, or failure to contemplate them as they really are, produce further forms of craving within them. Thus it is clear that if one does not begin by clearly contemplating feeling, it is impossible to truly cut off craving and the subsequent clinging, becoming, and suffering that continue the round of rebirth.  

III.2 Craving and the Continuation of Feeling  

Although feeling arises due to contact, craving is the pathway and direction that cause feeling to keep arising and endlessly revolve. The doctrine states that feeling arises dependent on contact, whereas craving is the pathway through which feeling continues to arise, be sustained, and unfold. If one incessantly responds to feeling with craving, the cycle of feeling will never come to an end. Therefore, the arising of feeling depends on the condition of contact on the one hand, and on the other, craving’s involvement makes it even more entrenched, turning it into the driving force for the continuation of rebirth.  

III.3 Feeling as a Domain of Dukkha (Suffering)  

Within the content of the truth of dukkha, the various feelings that arise from the six contacts are all regarded as specific domains of suffering. Whatever feelings arise dependent on eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—are, in their very nature, dukkha and must be understood as such. Furthermore, all feelings arise from impermanent contacts; because they are impermanent, they certainly have the characteristics of oppression and instability. Therefore, “All conditioned phenomena are impermanent, thus they are dukkha.” The three types of feeling are all included within the domain of suffering and are objects that beings should contemplate as they really are and relinquish.  

IV. The Multiple Systems of Classifying Feeling  

IV.1 Classification by Basic Nature and Whether It Is Associated with Sensual Pleasure  

The diversity of feeling is first manifested in its basic nature. The body naturally generates various feelings, including pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings. In terms of fundamental nature, pleasant feeling is agreeable, painful feeling is disagreeable, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is neither agreeable nor disagreeable. In addition, feelings can be classified according to the conditions under which they arise into two major types: “feelings associated with sensual pleasure” and “feelings not associated with sensual pleasure.” Whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, any of them may arise accompanied by sensual pleasure, or may arise without being accompanied by sensual pleasure. This constitutes a more fine-grained system of classification.  

IV.2 Classification by Bodily and Mental Function and by the Five Faculties  

As mentioned earlier, feelings can be divided into bodily feelings and mental feelings, and in terms of function they unfold into the five feeling-faculties: pleasure, pain, joy, grief, and equanimity. The pleasure-faculty and pain-faculty mainly concern bodily pleasure and pain; the joy-faculty and grief-faculty concern mental gladness and sorrow; the equanimity-faculty covers neutral feelings on both bodily and mental levels. These five faculties can be collectively summarized as pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; or, starting from the three types of feeling, one can further analyze them into the five faculties. In this way, one can more concretely understand the detailed structure of how feelings operate within body and mind.  

IV.3 Further Subdivisions Based on the Six Contacts, Applied and Sustained Thought, and Worldly Orientation  

In more detailed subdivisions, feelings can be expanded into eighteen, thirty-six, and even one hundred and eight types. The eighteen types of feeling are established based on the involvement of applied and sustained thought (vitakka and vicāra). These include six joy-near-sustained-thought feelings—that is, six joyful feelings associated with seeking and examining; six grief-near-sustained-thought feelings—six sorrowful feelings associated with seeking and examining; and six equanimity-near-sustained-thought feelings—six neutral-equanimous feelings associated with seeking and examining. These eighteen types of feeling are all connected with the mental activities of applied and sustained thought.  

The thirty-six types of feeling are distinguished by orientation toward the household life and orientation toward renunciation. They include six joys connected with the household—six forms of delight that cling to the worldly, related to household life; six joys connected with renunciation—six joys that incline toward renunciation and the path of liberation; six griefs connected with the household—six sorrows arising from attachment to the worldly; six griefs connected with renunciation—six sorrows that arise in the context of moving toward renunciation; six equanimities connected with the household—six neutral-equanimous feelings that arise within attachment to the worldly; and six equanimities connected with renunciation—six neutral-equanimous feelings that arise in a renunciant orientation. Together these constitute thirty-six feelings related to the two orientations: worldly and renunciant.  

IV.4 The One Hundred and Eight Feelings According to Temporal Distribution  

If the thirty-six feelings mentioned above are further observed according to temporal distribution, a system of one hundred and eight feelings emerges. Concretely, there are thirty-six past feelings—the thirty-six types of feeling situated in the domain of the past; thirty-six future feelings—the thirty-six types situated in the domain of the future; and thirty-six present feelings—the thirty-six types currently being experienced in the present. With thirty-six for each of past, future, and present, the total is one hundred and eight feelings. This complete system aims to fully describe the various aspects of feeling along the dimension of time.  

IV.5 The Principle Behind the Many Numerical Classifications in the Doctrine  

The doctrine further states that, in expounding the teaching, one may, according to different lines of reasoning, divide feelings into two, three, five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, and even one hundred and eight types. All these methods of classification are based on reasonable principles and are meant to fully clarify the many dimensions and systematic classifications of feeling. The construction of this entire framework is intended to help listeners understand the diversity of feeling more thoroughly. The real purpose of teaching in this way is to guide beings to live together in harmony, delighting in one another, not to provoke debate or division.  

IV.6 Pleasant Feeling and the Establishment of “Pleasure”  

In describing “pleasure,” the doctrine is not restricted to a narrow sense of pleasant feeling. It is not that only a single specific pleasant feeling is called “pleasure”; rather, wherever and whenever pleasure can be obtained, that situation may be designated as “pleasure.” In other words, the doctrine does not establish pleasant feeling under just one fixed concept; instead, in any place and under any circumstances, wherever a pleasant experience can be obtained, the Tathāgata designates that as a locus of “pleasure.”  

V. The Multiple Causes for the Arising of Feeling  

V.1 Eight Concrete Causes for Arising  

The arising of feelings does not have a single source; instead, it emerges from multiple concrete and observable causes. From the perspective of bodily and mental conditions and external factors, there are eight principal causes for the arising of feeling.  

First, imbalance of bile: when the bile within the body is out of balance, it gives rise to corresponding painful or other kinds of feeling. Second, imbalance of phlegm: when bodily phlegm is not well regulated, it also produces various feelings. Third, imbalance of wind: when the internal vital winds (bodily energies) do not function harmoniously, they likewise cause changes in feeling. Fourth, combined imbalance of bile, phlegm, and wind: when these three are simultaneously or complexly out of balance, they bring about more complicated feeling responses.  

Fifth, seasonal and climatic changes: alterations in the external environment such as cold and heat, dampness and dryness, also induce different feelings in body and mind. Sixth, encountering unfavorable circumstances: various adverse conditions in life lead to painful feelings or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings. Seventh, sudden injury: external trauma or accidents directly cause intense bodily and mental feelings. Eighth, the fruition of past actions: when past karma matures, it manifests in the present as various pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings. These eight causes broadly explain the processes by which all pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings arise.  

V.2 Refuting the Erroneous View of a Single Cause  

Since feelings arise from the many causes described above, any theory that claims “feelings are produced by a single cause only (for example, solely by past karma)” directly contradicts facts that are knowable by oneself and publicly acknowledged in the world, and therefore is considered a wrong view. The doctrine clearly states that the arising of feelings is the result of many conditions converging: it includes various internal bodily imbalances, external seasons and circumstances, sudden events, as well as the fruition of past actions. Reducing feelings to a single source not only fails to match actual observation; it also goes against the spirit of the principle of dependent origination.  

VI. The Impermanent Nature and Oppressive Quality of Feeling  

VI.1 Feeling as Illusory Foam and the Impermanence of Conditioned Phenomena  

From the standpoint of contemplating the five aggregates, the aggregate of feeling is like foam on the surface of water—seemingly existent at first glance, but in reality arising and ceasing in a flash, with no substantial essence to be found. Since all feelings depend on impermanent contact to arise, and contact itself is impermanent, fabricated, and dependently arisen, all pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings conditioned by contact likewise have the nature of impermanence and insubstantiality. The doctrine repeatedly emphasizes that feelings arising from the six contacts—whether pleasant, painful, or neither—are all impermanent. If one can clearly observe the impermanence of these feelings, one will no longer develop attachment to them or mistakenly regard them as permanent, reliable, or dependable existents.  

VI.2 Feeling, Suffering, and Phenomena Subject to Decay  

From the perspective of suffering, any feeling that arises dependent on eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, or mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither—is, in its very nature, dukkha (suffering). This is because all conditioned phenomena, all fabrications, are impermanent; being impermanent, they are suffering. Hence the three types of feeling are concrete manifestations of suffering. Additionally, feelings born of the six contacts are regarded as phenomena subject to decay, for they are constantly in a state of deterioration and cessation. Pleasant feelings may appear delightful on the surface, but they too decay; painful feelings obviously display oppression and instability; neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings may seem bland, but they are in fact difficult to maintain for long. All these are genuine aspects of decay that practitioners must squarely face when contemplating impermanence and suffering.  

VI.3 Contact, Consciousness, and Feeling as Sources of Oppression  

In analyzing sources of oppression, consciousness, contact, and feeling are all taken into account. The six types of consciousness—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness—arise in dependence on the six contacts: eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact. The feelings that arise dependent on these contacts—pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant—constitute the roots of the many forms of oppression and unease in life. When beings fail to contemplate these contact-born feelings and instead allow greed, hatred, and delusion to operate upon them, they are profoundly oppressed by them without even realizing it.  

VII. The Different Responses of Ordinary People and Noble Disciples to Feeling  

VII.1 The Attachment and Bondage of Ordinary People in Facing Feeling  

When ordinary people face pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings, they typically generate attachment and defilement. Encountering painful feelings, they easily fall into sorrow, weariness, grief, lamentation, and confusion, thereby bearing two kinds of suffering: one is bodily, at the level of feeling; the other is mental, as inner torment. In the face of painful feeling, they react with aversion and retain the latent tendency of aversion in their hearts; in the face of pleasant feeling, they enjoy and cling to it, maintaining the latent tendency of greed; with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, because they fail to see it as it really is, they retain the latent tendency of ignorance. Because they do not clearly understand the arising, cessation, sweetness, danger, and escape from feelings, ordinary people are bound by all feelings and thus are tightly fettered by birth, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, unable to free themselves.  

VII.2 The Dispassion and Liberation of Noble Disciples in Facing Feeling  

In contrast, noble disciples do not generate attachment and defilement when encountering pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings. When they face painful feelings, they no longer wander in sorrow, weariness, grief, lamentation, and confusion; thus they bear only one kind of suffering—bodily feeling—and no longer undergo mental torment. Regarding painful feeling, they do not give rise to aversion and no longer retain the habit of aversion. Regarding pleasant feeling, they no longer delight in or cling to it and do not retain the latent tendency of greed. Regarding neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, they see it as it really is, and therefore do not retain the latent tendency of ignorance.  

When noble disciples experience pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings, they know that these feelings are impermanent, not to be clung to, not to be delighted in. Within all feelings, they are able to experience them in a way that is detached, so that the mind no longer grasps them. Because they clearly understand the arising, cessation, sweetness, danger, and escape with regard to feelings, they can stay far away from all bondage by feelings and are no longer fettered by birth, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.  

VII.3 The Core Content of Seeing Feeling as It Really Is  

To reach a state in which one is not bound by feelings, one must discern, as it really is, five aspects of all feelings.  

First, one must clearly see the arising of all feelings—that is, understand that they all arise dependent on contact and multiple conditions. Second, one must clearly see the cessation of all feelings—understand that when the corresponding contact and conditions cease, the feeling necessarily ceases.  

Third, one must clearly see the sweetness of all feelings—that is, the pleasant flavor and allure that make beings cling to them. Fourth, one must clearly see the danger of all feelings—that is, the harm and oppressive quality hidden behind them.  

Fifth, one must clearly know the way of escape from feelings, understanding how not to let the mind be carried along by feelings and how to abandon grasping and bondage. When a person possesses right understanding in these five respects, they can truly be liberated from the fetters of feeling.  

VII.4 The Concrete Manifestation of a State Free from Bondage  

When a liberated practitioner experiences pleasant feeling, what they feel within it is freedom from bondage; when they experience painful feeling, what they feel is still freedom from bondage; even when they experience neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, what they feel is likewise freedom from bondage. In other words, although the three kinds of feeling still arise according to conditions, the mind is no longer bound by them and can abide in liberation amidst any feeling. This state is precisely the concrete embodiment of what was described earlier as “being able to feel in a detached way amid all feelings, with the mind not grasping.”  

VIII. The Practice of Properly Contemplating Feeling and the Path to Liberation  

VIII.1 Observing the Arising and Ceasing of Feeling  

The practice of the noble disciple particularly emphasizes observing the process of the arising and ceasing of feelings. When pleasant feeling arises due to pleasant contact, the practitioner clearly knows by what it has arisen; when pleasant contact ceases, they see as it really is that pleasant feeling ceases accordingly. Similarly, painful feeling arises due to painful contact, and when painful contact ceases, painful feeling also ceases. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises due to neutral contact, and when that contact ceases, the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling likewise ceases. By personally observing the sequence of the arising and cessation of feelings in this way, one can verify from experience the dependent arising and cessation of feelings and cease mistaking them as something permanent and truly existent.  

VIII.2 Observing the Impermanence, Suffering, and Emptiness of the Six Contacts and Feelings  

Practitioners must also contemplate the impermanence and suffering-emptiness of the six contacts and the feelings that arise from them. Eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-contact are all impermanent, and the pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings that arise dependent on these six contacts are likewise impermanent. Further observation reveals that feelings born of the six contacts—whether pleasant, painful, or neither—are, in their nature, suffering and phenomena subject to decay. Because both feeling and contact are impermanent and oppressive, the practitioner, in contemplating them, gradually comes to see the impermanence, suffering, and emptiness of all phenomena, no longer mistakenly believing that there is an attainable self or permanent entity within them.  

VIII.3 Feelings as Objects of Right View and as Phenomena to Be Abandoned  

Within the scope of right view, the six contacts and the feelings that arise from them are objects that must be known as they really are. Eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-contact, and the feelings that arise dependent on them—pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant—should all be brought into the field of right contemplation.  

At the same time, the doctrine points out that what is to be abandoned includes the six faculties, the six objects, the six consciousnesses, the six contacts, and the feelings arising from them. Faculties, objects, consciousnesses, and contacts are all to be given up, and any pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings born of contact are likewise to be abandoned. Concretely speaking, all feelings that arise dependent on eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither—are to be observed and recognized as impermanent, suffering, and empty, and ultimately relinquished.  

VIII.4 The Difference Between Guarding and Not Guarding the Mind  

In the interaction between feelings and objects, whether or not one guards the mind leads to completely different results. Not guarding the mind means delighting in, praising, clinging to, and dwelling in regard to various objects. When the mind is in this state, the practitioner should know for themselves that they have fallen away from wholesome states; this is what the Blessed One called a “regressive state.”  

Guarding the mind, by contrast, means not delighting in, not praising, not clinging to, and not dwelling in that state of craving toward those objects. When a practitioner can maintain this attitude of non-clinging, they should know for themselves that they have not fallen away from wholesome states; this is what the Blessed One called a “non-regressive state.” This difference between guarding and not guarding applies equally to one’s attitude toward feelings and is a crucial key in practicing the path of liberation.  

VIII.5 The Noble Eightfold Path and the Cessation of Feeling  

The cessation of feeling occurs, on the one hand, naturally through the cessation of contact; on the other hand, there is a definite path of practice that leads to this cessation. The doctrine states that feeling arises dependent on contact and ceases with the cessation of contact; simultaneously, craving is the pathway for the arising and continuation of feeling, whereas the Noble Eightfold Path is the pathway leading to the cessation of feeling.  

The Noble Eightfold Path consists of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Through cultivating these eight factors, the practitioner gradually weakens and cuts off craving for contact and feeling. In the end, feelings may still arise and cease according to conditions, but they are no longer supported by craving and thus no longer function as causes of bondage and continued saṃsāra.  

IX. The Operational Laws of the Sense Faculties, the Six Objects, and Feeling  

IX.1 The Basic Pattern of Operation in the Sense Domain  

Within the operation of the sense domain there is a stable and unchanging law: when the sense faculty, object, consciousness, and contact come together, feeling inevitably arises. When eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind meet their respective objects—forms, sounds, odors, flavors, tangibles, and mental objects—and corresponding eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness arise, eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact are thereby formed. From these contacts, pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings further arise.  

The doctrine explains more concretely: when there is an eye, only based on the condition of eye-contact do pleasant and painful feelings arise internally; when there is an ear, only based on the condition of ear-contact do pleasant and painful feelings arise internally; the same holds for nose, tongue, body, and mind. If there is no mind-faculty, then there will be no internal pleasant or painful feelings arising dependent on mind-contact. From this it is clear that the mind-faculty plays an indispensable, central role in the arising of feeling.  

IX.2 The General Rule Governing the Generation of Feeling  

The pattern of feeling’s generation can be further elaborated: when a sense domain meets a pleasant object, corresponding consciousness and pleasure-type contact arise dependent on that, and thus pleasant feeling is produced. When a sense domain meets an unpleasant object, corresponding consciousness and pain-type contact arise dependent on that, and thus painful feeling is produced. When a sense domain meets a discardable (neutral) object, corresponding consciousness and equanimity-type contact arise dependent on that, and thus neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is produced.  

In other words, the category of feeling depends on the nature of the sensory object—whether it is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—and on the corresponding nature of the contact—pleasure-type, pain-type, or equanimity-type. This confirms the core law: when the sense domain contacts its object, different kinds of contact arise, and different kinds of contact in turn elicit different types of feeling.  

IX.3 The Objects of the Six Contacts and the Suffering of Attachment  

Within the domain of the five sense desires, the forms known by the eye, sounds known by the ear, odors known by the nose, flavors known by the tongue, and tangibles known by the body are all pleasant, desirable, and agreeable objects that arouse desire and can be defiled. Gods and humans often take forms, sounds, odors, flavors, tangibles, and mental objects as sources of enjoyment and stimulation, regarding them as the sources of happiness and satisfaction. However, when these objects deteriorate, separate, or cease, those who cling strongly to them end up abiding in suffering. This shows that when the objects of the six contact-bases become objects of craving, they will inevitably lead to the arising of suffering.  

IX.4 The Noble Ones’ Direct Knowledge of the Six Objects  

In contrast, noble ones have direct and realistic knowledge of the six objects. They know, as it really is, the arising and cessation of forms, sounds, odors, flavors, tangibles, and mental objects, and they understand the sweetness, danger, and escape with regard to them. Precisely because they grasp these three aspects of truth, they no longer take these phenomena as pleasures, nor are they stimulated by them. Thus, when these phenomena deteriorate or cease, they remain calmly abiding and are not swayed by external conditions.  

Regarding all feelings that arise from these objects, noble ones likewise face them with realistic understanding, neither being bewitched by their sweetness nor shaken by their danger.  

X. The Limits and End of Feeling  

X.1 Understanding the Limits of Bodily Feelings and Life-Bound Feelings  

At different stages of life, practitioners also have a clear understanding of the limits of feeling. When one experiences feelings limited by the body, one knows, “I experience feelings limited by the body,” understanding that these are feelings that arise with the body as their range and basis. When one experiences feelings limited by life, one knows, “I experience feelings limited by life,” understanding that these are feelings that arise with the life-process as their range. This understanding prevents one from mistaking feelings as some permanent entity that transcends body and life; instead, one clearly knows that feelings have boundaries corresponding to the presence of body and life.  

X.2 The Cooling of Feeling at the End of Life  

When the body disintegrates and life comes to an end, the practitioner knows as it really is: “Here, all that has been felt and delighted in is completely cooled.” That is, as body and mind collapse, everything that has been experienced and enjoyed is cooled and brought to rest at this point. This direct knowledge of the end of feeling frees one from fear and confusion regarding death, making it clear that feeling itself is only a temporary phenomenon within the span of body and life, and in the end will return to coolness and stillness.  

XI. Feeling, the Five Faculties, and Their Dependent Arising and Cessation  

XI.1 Definition and Classification of the Five Faculties  

The five faculties—pleasure, pain, joy, grief, and equanimity—are the five basic functional modes through which feeling operates within body and mind. The pleasure-faculty is bodily pleasure and comfort, feelings of pleasure and agreeableness produced by bodily contact. The pain-faculty is bodily pain and discomfort, feelings of pain and disagreeableness produced by bodily contact. The joy-faculty is mental happiness and ease, feelings of pleasure and agreeableness produced by mental contact. The grief-faculty is mental sorrow and dejection, feelings of pain and disagreeableness produced by mental contact. The equanimity-faculty includes bodily or mental feelings that are neither agreeable nor disagreeable, a state of calm equanimity.  

In terms of classification, the pleasure-faculty and joy-faculty can be grouped under pleasant feeling; the pain-faculty and grief-faculty under painful feeling; and the equanimity-faculty under neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. This shows that the three types of feeling and the five faculties can mutually include and unfold one another: the five faculties can be summarized as three feelings, and the three feelings can in turn be elaborated into the five faculties.  

XI.2 The Dependent Arising and Cessation of the Five Faculties Based on Contact  

The arising and cessation of the five faculties are likewise governed by the law of dependent origination. The arising of all five faculties depends on their corresponding contacts. The pleasure-faculty arises dependent on contact that produces pleasant feeling; the pain-faculty arises dependent on contact that produces painful feeling; the joy-faculty arises dependent on contact that produces joyous feeling; the grief-faculty arises dependent on contact that produces sorrowful feeling; and the equanimity-faculty arises dependent on contact that produces equanimous feeling.  

When the contacts that can give rise to these five faculties cease, the corresponding faculties also cease and come to rest. Thus, although the five faculties are the fundamental functional modes of feeling, they too are conditioned phenomena that arise and cease dependent on contact and do not possess any permanent, unchanging self-nature.
