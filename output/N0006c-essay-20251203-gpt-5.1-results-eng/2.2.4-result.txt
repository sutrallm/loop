<title> The Five Hindrances and the Seven Factors of Awakening: The Complete Path from Obstruction to Liberation </title>
<article>
I.  The Noble Recipient of Offerings and the Five Mental Obstructions

I.1  The Fundamental Qualities of a Noble Recipient of Offerings  
A truly noble recipient of offerings must be free from five kinds of mental obstructions. These five obstructions, also called the Five Hindrances, are sensual desire for sense pleasures, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt about the truth. Anyone who can stay far away from these five obstructions has a mind that is clear and pliant, fit to receive offerings and fit to receive the training of all true Dharma.

I.2  The Names and Nature of the Five Hindrances  
The Five Hindrances, according to their function of covering the mind, are called the hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of sloth and torpor, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance of doubt. They are an “aggregation of unwholesome states,” a summary of all unwholesome phenomena, specializing in obstructing the arising of wholesome States. These five mental obstructions defile the mind, making it unpliant and impure, casting it into darkness and ignorance, covering over wisdom, and ultimately bringing damage and ruin. They are the fundamental forces that obstruct nirvana.

I.3  The Five Hindrances and Whether One Can Realize Nirvana in This Life  
Whether one can realize nirvana in this very life is directly related to whether one is liberated from the Five Hindrances. If a practitioner has not yet been freed from the defilements of the Five Hindrances, this means they do not yet truly understand these five mental obstructions that should be abandoned, and have not yet cultivated the methods that counteract them. Therefore, it is impossible for such a person to realize nirvana in this life. Conversely, if a practitioner has already been liberated from the defilements of the Five Hindrances, this means they truly know these five obstructions that should be abandoned and have in practice cultivated the methods that counteract them, and thus they possess the conditions for realizing nirvana in this very life.

I.4  Cutting Off the Hindrances in Two Stages: Learner and Final  
The cutting off of the Five Hindrances can be divided into two levels: the level of the learner, and the final level. At the learner’s level, the practitioner is able, one by one, to cut off the hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of sloth and torpor, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance of doubt, so that they do not function at that time. At the final level, the Five Hindrances have been utterly cut off, like severing the root of a tree so that it disappears and never arises again in the future.

I.5  Detailed Classification of the Five Hindrances  
The Five Hindrances can be further subdivided into ten types. The hindrance of sensual desire can be divided into internal sensual desire and external sensual desire, both of which are obstructions. The hindrance of ill will likewise is divided into internal ill will and external ill will, both of which are obstructions. Within the hindrance of sloth and torpor, mental sinking is one obstruction, and sleep itself is another obstruction. The hindrance of restlessness and remorse arises from two sides—inner agitation and remorse—which together form an obstruction. The hindrance of doubt includes doubt regarding internal phenomena and doubt regarding external phenomena; both kinds of doubt constitute an obstruction.

II.  The Arising, Growth, and Harm of the Five Hindrances

II.1  The Five Hindrances as Dependent on “Nourishment”  
The Five Hindrances do not arise without conditions; they depend on specific conditions, called “nutriment” or “food,” in order to arise, grow, and persist. If these conditions are not cut off, the Five Hindrances will continually flourish; once these conditions are severed, the Five Hindrances can no longer arise or remain.

II.2  Specific Conditions That Promote the Growth of Each Hindrance  
Each hindrance has its own special conditions that promote its growth. Sensual desire grows when one latches onto the “sign of the beautiful” and reflects on it with unwise attention. Ill will grows when one clings to the “sign of the repulsive (for anger)” and likewise observes it with unwise attention. Sloth and torpor grow out of bodily and mental states such as lack of joy, fatigue, depression, overeating, and mental shrinking, and then corresponding to them with unwise attention. Restlessness and remorse grow when the mind is “not at peace” and one engages with that with unwise attention. Doubt grows when one attends to “states that are grounds for doubt” and thinks about them with unwise attention, causing doubt to deepen more and more.

II.3  How Modes of Reflection Affect Both the Five Hindrances and the Seven Factors of Awakening  
The arising and growth of the Five Hindrances and of the Seven Factors of Awakening entirely depend on where the mind is directed and how it reflects. If one continually attends to objects that nourish unwholesome states, then unarisen unwholesome states will arise and arisen unwholesome states will grow. Such wrong reflection will cause the unarisen Five Hindrances to arise and the arisen Five Hindrances to grow, while at the same time inhibiting the development of the Seven Factors of Awakening. Conversely, if one continually attends to objects that nourish the Seven Factors of Awakening and reflects on them with wise attention, then unarisen awakening factors will arise and arisen factors will move toward fulfillment, while the Five Hindrances are suppressed and weakened.

II.4  Concrete Objects of Reflection and Their Opposite Effects  
In practical application, the very same type of object can have completely opposite effects on the Five Hindrances and the Seven Factors of Awakening, depending on how it is reflected upon. If one attends to the domains of arousing energy, of vigorous effort, and of courageous exertion with correct reflection, this will strengthen the factor of awakening of energy (effort) and suppress sloth and torpor; if one attends to them with wrong reflection, it will suppress the factor of energy. With regard to wholesome and unwholesome states, blameworthy and blameless states, inferior and superior states, and states that are mixed black and white, correct reflection will strengthen the factor of awakening of discrimination of states (investigation of dhammas) and suppress doubt; wrong reflection will suppress that factor and increase doubt. If one attends to the stilling of the mind with correct reflection, it will strengthen the factor of awakening of concentration and suppress restlessness and remorse; wrong reflection will suppress the concentration factor and increase restlessness and remorse. Furthermore, regarding the specific objects that belong to the mindfulness factor, the joy factor, and the equanimity factor, as well as bodily ease, mental ease, the sign of stillness, and the sign of non-distraction: if one reflects on them correctly, the corresponding factor of awakening grows; if one reflects on them wrongly, the corresponding factor is suppressed.

III.  The Definition, Composition, and Basic Nature of the Seven Factors of Awakening

III.1  Names and Composition of the Seven Factors of Awakening  
The Seven Factors of Awakening are a set of seven elements that lead to awakening. Because they assist practitioners in attaining awakening, they are called “awakening factors.” These seven elements of awakening are: the mindfulness factor, the factor of discrimination of states (investigation of dhammas), the energy (effort) factor, the joy factor, the tranquility factor, the concentration factor, and the equanimity factor. Wherever the Seven Factors of Awakening are discussed, they refer to this set of seven.

III.2  The Fundamental Nature of These Factors of Awakening  
The Seven Factors of Awakening themselves have the nature of being unobstructed, uncovered, and free from the disturbances of mental defilements. They are non-damaging states; they do not harm any wholesome quality, but instead foster wisdom and liberation. To cultivate and repeatedly cultivate the Seven Factors of Awakening brings about clear vision and wisdom, increasing wisdom without harming it, powerfully aiding the attainment of nirvana and helping one directly realize the fruit of liberation in this very life. The Seven Factors of Awakening form a non-damaging path leading to liberation; they are the path and method leading to the cessation of craving. By cultivating them, one can gradually accomplish the cutting off of craving, the cutting off of karma, and the cutting off of suffering.

III.3  The Discriminative and Counteractive Function of the Seven Factors in Liberation  
The cultivation of the Seven Factors of Awakening gives rise to discriminative wisdom—wisdom that penetrates and breaks through those accumulations of defilement that were previously not seen clearly, namely the aggregates of greed, hatred, and delusion. Through practicing the Seven Factors of Awakening, one can cut off all fettering states. These fettering states refer to the sense faculties and mental consciousness that give rise to bondage and clinging: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Only when these six faculties are no longer bound by fetters can liberation truly be realized.

III.4  The Seven Factors as Causes of Wisdom and Vision  
The causes of lack of wisdom and lack of true vision lie in the Five Hindrances. When the mind is entangled by sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt, and cannot rightly know and see the path of release, this constitutes the cause of non-wisdom. In direct contrast, the Seven Factors of Awakening are the specific causes of wisdom and vision. When one cultivates mindfulness, discrimination of states, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity grounded in seclusion, in dispassion, and in cessation, and directed toward letting go, then right knowledge and vision arise, and true wisdom appears.

III.5  The Fundamental Rule for Cultivating the Seven Factors of Awakening  
In cultivating any of the awakening factors, one must follow the same basic principle: all cultivation must be based on seclusion (from defilements and clinging), based on dispassion (freedom from craving), and based on cessation (leading toward the quenching of defilements), with all practice ultimately directed toward equanimity—an even, peaceful, and non-clinging state. This core rule of practice applies universally and evenly to all seven factors. Whether mindfulness, discrimination of states, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, or equanimity, all must be cultivated on the basis of seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and directed toward equanimity.

IV.  The Arising Conditions of the Seven Factors of Awakening, Their “Nourishment,” and Wise Attention

IV.1  The Principle That the Seven Factors Arise Dependent on “Nourishment”  
The Seven Factors of Awakening likewise depend on specific conditions—“nutriment”—for their arising, growth, and persistence. If these conditions are cut off, the Seven Factors cannot arise or persist; if one skillfully gathers and maintains these conditions, the Seven Factors will continually grow and move toward fulfillment.

IV.2  Specific Conditions for the Fulfillment of Each Factor  
Each factor of awakening has its particular conditions for arising and reaching fulfillment. The mindfulness factor arises and grows by relying on “objects that are bases for the mindfulness factor” together with wise attention. The factor of discrimination of states arises by wisely attending to wholesome and unwholesome states, blameworthy and blameless states, inferior and superior states, and mixed black-and-white states. The energy factor grows by taking as its objects “the domain of arousing energy, the domain of vigorous effort, and the domain of courageous exertion,” and reflecting on them with wise attention. The joy factor arises by relying on “objects that are bases for the joy factor,” and arises through wise attention. The tranquility factor is fulfilled by relying on “bodily tranquility and mental tranquility,” together with wise attention. The concentration factor arises and stabilizes by relying on “the sign of stillness and the sign of non-distraction,” accompanied by wise attention. The equanimity factor matures by taking as object “objects that are bases for the equanimity factor” and cultivating them with wise attention.

IV.3  Recognizing the Inner State When the Factors Arise  
While cultivating any awakening factor, the practitioner should clearly know the changes in their own mind. When the mind has reached the state of wholesome liberation—when sloth and torpor have been completely cut off, restlessness and remorse have been fully subdued, and energy, aspiration, and purposeful attention that does not shrink back have arisen—this is the critical moment when the awakening factors can arise and grow. If one then skillfully cultivates the Seven Factors of Awakening with wise attention on this basis, one can confirm that one has achieved “dwelling in well-being”: the mind abides in a peaceful, bright, and undefiled state.

IV.4  How Unarisen Factors of Awakening Come to Arise  
Whether the Seven Factors of Awakening can come from a state of non-arising to arising depends on whether one cultivates and repeatedly cultivates the Seven Factors themselves. As long as one continually cultivates them according to the basic principles, they can arise from non-arising and grow from arising to development and fulfillment. There is only one circumstance in which this rule does not operate: when the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Fully Enlightened One has not appeared in the world. In such an era, the unarisen Seven Factors of Awakening do not manifest in the world.

IV.5  Wise Attention as the Most Crucial Inner Condition  
Among all internal conditions, wise attention is the most crucial factor for the arising and fulfillment of the Seven Factors of Awakening. One endowed with wise attention can, when facing various phenomena, reflect and choose in the right way, thereby being able to cultivate and repeatedly cultivate the Seven Factors of Awakening, allowing them to mature day by day and become a force that leads to liberation.

V.  The Order of Practice of the Seven Factors of Awakening and Their Seven Fruits

V.1  The Sequential Arising of the Seven Factors  
The Seven Factors of Awakening do not arise in a random or disorderly way; they arise in a definite sequence. When a practitioner abides in recollection (mindfulness) and reflects on the meaning of the Dharma, the mindfulness factor arises. When the mindfulness factor has been cultivated to fulfillment, one can abide in right mindfulness and, with wisdom, discriminate, examine, and investigate the meaning of the Dharma. When the mind abides in right mindfulness and with wisdom observes the Dharma, the factor of discrimination of states arises; when this factor has been cultivated to fulfillment, one can with wisdom discriminate, examine, and investigate the meaning of the Dharma, and at the same time an unwavering energy arises in the mind. When, by wisely observing the Dharma, the practitioner gives rise to unwavering energy, the energy factor arises; when the energy factor is cultivated to fulfillment, it brings joy born of seclusion from sensual desire. When energy is aroused and joy of renunciation is obtained, the joy factor arises; when the joy factor is cultivated to fulfillment, the heart is filled with delight, which then brings bodily and mental tranquility and ease. When the mind is joyful and thus gains bodily and mental tranquility, the tranquility factor arises; when the tranquility factor is cultivated to fulfillment, bodily tranquility brings pleasant feeling, and pleasant feeling gives rise to mental stability. When bodily tranquility receives pleasant feeling and the mind becomes stable, the concentration factor arises; after the concentration factor has been cultivated to fulfillment, the practitioner attains firm mental collectedness and becomes one who is skilled in observation. When firm concentration has been obtained and one is skilled in observation, the equanimity factor arises; if the equanimity factor is cultivated to fulfillment, the mind can abide in an even, peaceful, and non-clinging state.

V.2  The Arising and Fulfillment of the Seven Factors within the Four Establishments of Mindfulness  
In the practice of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, the Seven Factors of Awakening arise and come to fulfillment in this same sequence. When a practitioner establishes mindfulness on any one of the four foundations and abides with mindfulness that does not forget, the mindfulness factor arises. While abiding in right mindfulness, if one uses wisdom to discriminate, examine, and investigate the observed phenomenon, the factor of discrimination of states arises. Through such wise discrimination and examination, unwavering energy is aroused, giving rise to the energy factor. Once energy is aroused, the practitioner attains joy that is independent of material conditions, and the joy factor arises. When the heart is filled with joy, both body and mind become tranquil and at ease, and the tranquility factor arises. After bodily tranquility is established, pleasant feeling and mental stability arise, and the concentration factor arises. When the mind becomes stable and is well used for observation, the equanimity factor follows. This entire process—from the arising to the fulfillment of mindfulness through to equanimity—applies not only in the practice of contemplation of the body, but equally in contemplation of feelings, of mind, and of phenomena (Dharma).

V.3  Fulfillment of Knowledge and Liberation through the Seven Factors  
The cultivation of the Seven Factors of Awakening does not merely make the mind more peaceful and clear; its ultimate purpose is the fulfillment of “knowledge” and “liberation.” In cultivating each factor, one must base it on seclusion, on dispassion, and on cessation, and direct it toward equanimity. When mindfulness, discrimination of states, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity are all practiced according to this principle and brought to fulfillment, then knowledge and liberation are fully realized. From the practice of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness that fulfills the Seven Factors of Awakening, and from the Seven Factors of Awakening that fulfill knowledge and liberation, this constitutes a crucial link in the sequential path of practice.

V.4  The Seven Fruits of Practicing the Seven Factors of Awakening  
If one practices and widely applies the Seven Factors of Awakening as described above, one may expect to obtain seven kinds of excellent fruits and merits. The first fruit is realizing awakening in this very life. The second fruit is: if one does not realize awakening in this life, one realizes awakening at the moment of death. If these first two fruits are not achieved, the third fruit is: by cutting off the five lower fetters, one attains nirvana in the intermediate state (nirvana in-between lives). If that is not attained, the fourth fruit is: by cutting off the five lower fetters, one attains nirvana upon rebirth (nirvana in the next life). If nirvana upon rebirth is not attained, the fifth fruit is: by cutting off the five lower fetters, one attains nirvana without exertion. If even that is not attained, the sixth fruit is: by cutting off the five lower fetters, one attains nirvana with exertion. If none of the above fruits are attained, the seventh fruit is: by cutting off the five lower fetters, one is reborn ascending up to the highest heaven of the form realm.

V.5  The Fundamental Rule of Practice Achievement and the Seven Factors  
Whether practice can be accomplished depends on an unbreakable fundamental rule. First, one must take moral discipline as the basic foundation; upon the firm basis of morality, one further cultivates the seven awakening factors. Through continuous and unremitting cultivation, one can attain vast accomplishment in all phenomena. In terms of the order of the path, if one cultivates and repeatedly cultivates the Seven Factors of Awakening, one fulfills knowledge and liberation. This is an important link in the overall system of practice, connecting the foundations to the final goal.

VI.  The Seven Factors of Awakening with the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, Mindfulness of Breathing, and Various Contemplations

VI.1  The Rule That the Four Establishments of Mindfulness Fulfill the Seven Factors  
In the complete sequence of the path, there is an important interconnection: by cultivating a single method, one can fulfill four methods; by cultivating four methods, one can fulfill seven methods; and by cultivating seven methods, one can fulfill two ultimate goals. In this context, the Four Establishments of Mindfulness are the four methods to be cultivated, and the Seven Factors of Awakening are the seven methods fulfilled through the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. On the basis of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, seven factors of awakening develop. When these seven factors are cultivated and deepened, they become conditions for the arising of knowledge and liberation.

VI.2  Integrating the Seven Factors of Awakening with Mindfulness of Breathing  
The practice of the Seven Factors of Awakening is not merely an abstract observation done only in sitting meditation; it must be closely integrated with mindfulness of in-and-out breathing. In cultivating each awakening factor, one must base it on three principles: seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and direct the mind toward equanimity. At the same time, each factor must be cultivated together with mindfulness of breathing. That is, in the very process of observing the breath, one simultaneously cultivates the mindfulness factor, the factor of discrimination of states, the energy factor, the joy factor, the tranquility factor, the concentration factor, and the equanimity factor. In this way, the Seven Factors of Awakening can gradually mature in the everyday awareness of breathing.

VI.3  The General Benefits of Contemplative Practices and Two Attainable Fruits  
To cultivate and repeatedly cultivate specific contemplations brings many excellent benefits. These include: obtaining great fruit and great benefit, realizing one of two attainments, accomplishing great purpose and advantage, obtaining great security, giving rise to great disenchantment, and leading to great abiding in happiness. The accomplishment of these contemplative benefits is not achieved by many scattered methods, but through one core method of practice: based on seclusion, based on dispassion, and based on cessation, and directed toward equanimity, one cultivates the Seven Factors of Awakening in conjunction with that contemplation.

VI.4  Ten Contemplative Themes and Their Coordination with the Seven Factors  
This method of practice that centers on the Seven Factors of Awakening is applicable to ten contemplative themes. These ten contemplations are: contemplation of bones, contemplation of the body as food for worms (being eaten), contemplation of blue-green discoloration, contemplation of decay, contemplation of bloating, loving-kindness contemplation, compassion contemplation, empathetic joy contemplation, equanimity contemplation, and contemplation of in-and-out breathing. When cultivating these ten contemplations, one should align them with the Seven Factors of Awakening, cultivating in turn the mindfulness factor, the factor of discrimination of states, the energy factor, the joy factor, the tranquility factor, the concentration factor, and the equanimity factor—and, as always, basing practice on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and directing it toward equanimity.

VI.5  Contemplation of Cessation and the Seven Factors of Awakening  
When cultivating the perception of cessation, one likewise relies on the Seven Factors of Awakening. The related contemplative themes include: contemplation of impurity, contemplation of death, contemplation of the repulsiveness of food, contemplation of the un-loveliness of all worldly things, contemplation of impermanence, contemplation of “impermanent, therefore suffering,” contemplation of “suffering, therefore not-self,” contemplation of cutting off, contemplation of dispassion, and contemplation of cessation itself. In cultivating these contemplations, one must base practice on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and direct it toward equanimity, while at the same time cultivating, together with the contemplation of cessation, the Seven Factors of Awakening—that is, the mindfulness factor, the factor of discrimination of states, the energy factor, the joy factor, the tranquility factor, the concentration factor, and the equanimity factor. This direction of practice leads toward nirvana.

VII.  Correspondence, Classification, and Mental Adjustment Between the Seven Factors and the Five Hindrances

VII.1  Contrasting the Growth Principles of the Five Hindrances and the Seven Factors  
The growth of the Five Hindrances depends on wrong reflection on specific objects; the growth of the Seven Factors of Awakening depends on right reflection on specific objects. For sensual desire, the related object is the “sign of the beautiful.” If one attends to it with wrong reflection, sensual desire increases; if one reflects correctly and instead takes the “sign of the unattractive” as object, sensual desire is suppressed. For ill will, the related object is the “sign of the repulsive (for anger).” Wrong reflection increases ill will; correct reflection that takes liberation through loving-kindness as object suppresses ill will. For sloth and torpor, the related objects are lack of joy, fatigue, depression, overeating, and mental shrinking: wrong reflection increases sloth and torpor; if one takes as object the domains of arousing energy, vigorous effort, and courageous exertion and reflects correctly, sloth and torpor are suppressed and the energy factor is strengthened. For restlessness and remorse, the related object is “the mind not at peace.” Wrong reflection increases restlessness and remorse; if one takes “the mind at peace” as object and reflects correctly, restlessness and remorse are suppressed and the concentration factor is strengthened. For doubt, the related objects are “states that are grounds for doubt.” Wrong reflection increases doubt; if one correctly reflects on wholesome and unwholesome states, blameworthy and blameless states, inferior and superior states, and mixed black-and-white states, doubt is suppressed and the factor of discrimination of states is strengthened. Furthermore, the specific objects for the mindfulness factor, the joy factor, and the equanimity factor, as well as bodily and mental tranquility and the sign of stillness and the sign of non-distraction—if one attends to them with correct reflection, the corresponding awakening factor grows; with wrong reflection, the corresponding factor is suppressed.

VII.2  The Fourteenfold and Tenfold Classifications of the Seven Factors and the Five Hindrances  
From another angle, the Seven Factors of Awakening can be divided into fourteen types, and the Five Hindrances into ten types. For the Seven Factors: the mindfulness factor can be divided into mindfulness of internal states and mindfulness of external states. The factor of discrimination of states can be divided into wise observation of external phenomena and wise observation of internal phenomena. The energy factor can be divided into physical effort and mental effort. The joy factor can be divided into joy accompanied by discursive thought and joy without discursive thought. The tranquility factor can be divided into bodily tranquility and mental tranquility. The concentration factor includes concentration accompanied by discursive thought and concentration without discursive thought. The equanimity factor can be divided into equanimity toward internal phenomena and equanimity toward external phenomena. As for the Five Hindrances: the hindrance of sensual desire can be divided into internal sensual desire and external sensual desire; the hindrance of ill will likewise into internal and external; within the hindrance of sloth and torpor, mental sinking and sleep are each separate obstructions; the hindrance of restlessness and remorse consists of inner agitation and remorse; the hindrance of doubt is divided into doubt regarding internal phenomena and doubt regarding external phenomena. Through such subdivision, one can observe and subdue various mental states with greater precision.

VII.3  Rules for Adjusting the Mind in States of Shrinking and Restlessness  
In actual practice, the mind often tends toward either shrinking (listlessness) or restlessness, and one must choose appropriate awakening factors according to the situation. When the mind is shrinking, one should emphasize the cultivation of the factors of discrimination of states, energy, and joy, using wisdom to observe the meaning of the Dharma, invigorating effort, and arousing joy; at such times one should not emphasize tranquility, concentration, and equanimity, to avoid making the mind even more subdued and leading to slackness. When the mind is in a state of restlessness, one should emphasize the tranquility factor, the concentration factor, and the equanimity factor, to soothe agitation, steady the mind, and incline it toward equanimity; in this situation, one should not further emphasize the factors of discrimination of states, energy, and joy, to avoid making the mind even more excited. The mindfulness factor, however, is universally applicable: it can and should be cultivated at any time and is the indispensable basis for adjusting the mind.

VII.4  The Four Bases of Spiritual Power and the Principle of Brightening the Mind  
In practices that are connected with the Seven Factors of Awakening, the cultivation of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power also follows common principles. When cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, one should not shrink back too much from the object—whether it is desire (aspiration), energy, mind, or investigation—while also cultivating a brightened mind, making the mind clear and luminous. Especially when cultivating “concentration based on investigation,” there are more specific rules: one should not be overly strenuous in “investigation,” nor should one be overly withdrawn inward or scattered outward; instead, one should cultivate a bright, expansive mind that is not bound or constricted. The general principle is that in practice the mental attitude should stay on the middle way—neither shrinking back too much nor over-striving—and with an expansive, unbound mind one should brighten the mind, in harmony with the stability and clarity of the Seven Factors of Awakening.

VIII.  The Universality of the Seven Factors, the Appearance of the Tathāgata, and the Complete Order of Practice

VIII.1  A Common Path of Liberation for Practitioners of the Three Times  
In the past, present, and future, all ascetics and brahmins who are able to cut off the three types of defilements do so by practicing and repeatedly practicing the Seven Factors of Awakening. Thus it can be seen that the Seven Factors of Awakening are the common path of liberation followed by practitioners in all three times, unrestricted by era or region.

VIII.2  The Appearance of the Tathāgata and the Treasure of the Seven Factors  
When the Tathāgata appears in the world, the treasure of the Seven Factors of Awakening appears, just as when a Wheel-Turning Monarch arises in the world, the seven treasures of a worldly emperor appear. The appearance of the Seven Factors of Awakening is an important sign of the appearance of the Enlightened One in the world, and it means that the true path that truly subdues Māra’s army has been presented to humanity.

VIII.3  The Seven Factors of Awakening and the Subduing of Māra’s Army  
These Seven Factors of Awakening are the right path for subduing Māra’s army. One who does not practice and repeatedly practice the Seven Factors of Awakening is called a foolish, dumb sheep and poor—meaning extremely impoverished in both wisdom and Dharma wealth. Conversely, one who practices and repeatedly practices the Seven Factors of Awakening is called wise, not dumb, and not poor—meaning endowed with wisdom and possessing abundant Dharma wealth.

VIII.4  The Seven Factors of Awakening and Liberation from All Bonds  
To know, fully know, completely exhaust, and cut off all fetters of defilement, one should cultivate the Seven Factors of Awakening. This is the fundamental method for liberating oneself from all bondage, and it is the key path that leads one to head toward nirvana, incline toward nirvana, and draw near to nirvana. When one practices and repeatedly practices the Seven Factors of Awakening, the mind naturally inclines toward nirvana and gradually approaches final liberation.

VIII.5  The Seven Factors of Awakening in the Complete Order of Practice  
In the complete order of the training system, one first uses the Four Establishments of Mindfulness to fulfill the Seven Factors of Awakening; then, through the Seven Factors of Awakening, one fulfills knowledge and liberation. In concrete stages of practice, on the basis of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness one develops the seven elements of awakening, and then cultivates and deepens these Seven Factors so that they become conditions for the arising of knowledge and liberation. This complete sequence means: within the Four Establishments of Mindfulness that one cultivates, one fulfills the Seven Factors of Awakening, and through the Seven Factors of Awakening one realizes the two ultimate goals.

IX.  Principles for Practicing the Seven Factors of Awakening, Dwelling in Well-Being, and Orientation toward Nirvana

IX.1  The General Outline for Practicing the Seven Factors and Dwelling in Well-Being  
The general outline for practicing the Seven Factors of Awakening is this: through internal wise attention one skillfully arouses the Seven Factors, thereby accomplishing dwelling in well-being. While cultivating any awakening factor, one should clearly know that one’s own mind has already reached a state of wholesome liberation, that sloth and torpor have been completely cut off, that restlessness and remorse have been fully subdued, and that energy, aspiration, and non-shrinking purposeful attention have arisen. By skillfully cultivating the Seven Factors of Awakening with such wise attention, one can confirm that one has attained the state of dwelling in well-being.

IX.2  The Fundamental Rule That Directs Practice toward Nirvana  
In cultivating the Seven Factors of Awakening, one must base practice on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and direct all practice toward equanimity. Such a direction naturally leads to nirvana. Whoever cultivates and repeatedly cultivates the Seven Factors of Awakening will have a mind that heads toward nirvana, inclines toward nirvana, and draws near to nirvana. In order to know and cut off all fetters of defilement, this cultivation of the Seven Factors of Awakening based on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation and directed toward equanimity is an indispensable fundamental method.

IX.3  Moral Discipline, the Seven Factors of Awakening, and the Accomplishment of Practice  
Seen from the perspective of the whole practice, one must first take moral discipline as the root foundation, and then, on this basis, cultivate the Seven Factors of Awakening. Next, through systematically cultivating these seven factors and continuing to deepen them, one can attain vast accomplishment in all phenomena and ultimately fulfill knowledge and liberation.

X.  The Decisive Role of the Five Hindrances and the Seven Factors in Wisdom and Non-Wisdom

X.1  The Five Hindrances as Causes of Non-Wisdom  
When the mind is entangled in sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt, it cannot rightly know and see the path of release. This is precisely the fundamental cause of non-wisdom and lack of true vision. The Five Hindrances not only darken the mind and make it ignorant; they also destroy wisdom, bring damage and ruin, and obstruct people from reaching nirvana. Therefore, the Five Hindrances are called an aggregation of unwholesome states and are at the core of all causes of non-wisdom.

X.2  The Seven Factors of Awakening as Causes of Wisdom and Vision  
In contrast, the Seven Factors of Awakening are the concrete causes of wisdom and vision. When one cultivates mindfulness, discrimination of states, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity based on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and directed toward equanimity, right knowledge and vision arise, becoming the cause of true wisdom. The Seven Factors of Awakening not only increase wisdom, they also directly aid in the realization of the fruit of knowledge and liberation.

XI.  The Concrete Content, Functions, and Key Points of Practice of the Seven Factors of Awakening

XI.1  Summary of the Content and Functions of the Seven Factors  
In many discourses, the content of the Seven Factors of Awakening is repeatedly stated, showing their importance. They are, in order: the mindfulness factor, the factor of discrimination of states, the energy factor, the joy factor, the tranquility factor, the concentration factor, and the equanimity factor. In the system of training in these awakening elements: the mindfulness factor is the clear awareness that keeps one awake; the factor of discrimination of states is the power to discern truth; the energy factor is the drive to make effort in practice; the joy factor is the inner delight; the tranquility factor is the calm and ease of body and mind; the concentration factor is the focused collectedness of the mind; and the equanimity factor is the attitude of evenness and letting go. These seven elements themselves are unobstructed, uncovered, and free from disturbing mental defilements; to cultivate and repeatedly cultivate them assists the development of wisdom and liberation.

XI.2  Universal Application of the Rule of Practice and Comprehensive Cultivation  
In all teachings concerning the Seven Factors of Awakening, the rule of practice is always the same: in cultivating the mindfulness factor, the factor of discrimination of states, the energy factor, the joy factor, the tranquility factor, the concentration factor, and the equanimity factor, one must base practice on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and direct it toward equanimity. This rule is universally applicable to each individual awakening factor and should also be broadly applied in all topics of practice. At the same time, the Seven Factors of Awakening must be cultivated continuously and widely, and they must be cultivated comprehensively: none of the seven should be neglected.

XI.3  The Seven Factors of Awakening as the Path to the Cessation of Craving, Karma, and Suffering  
The Seven Factors of Awakening are non-damaging states that lead to liberation; cultivating them is the path and method that leads to the extinction of craving. Through cultivating the Seven Factors of Awakening, one can gradually accomplish the cutting off of craving, thereby cutting off the motivation for creating karma, and ultimately attaining the complete cessation of suffering. In the process of practice, the discriminative wisdom generated by these factors penetrates the aggregates of greed, hatred, and delusion and cuts off all fettering states that arise through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, allowing liberation to be truly realized.

XII.  Focused Attention, Hearing True Dharma, and Clearing Obstructions

XII.1  Wise Attention and the Opposite Results for the Five Hindrances and the Seven Factors  
Wise attention and unwise attention have completely opposite effects on the Five Hindrances and the Seven Factors of Awakening. Unwise attention causes the unarisen Five Hindrances to arise and the arisen Five Hindrances to grow; wise attention, on the other hand, causes the unarisen Seven Factors of Awakening to arise and the arisen factors to move toward fulfillment. When the mind is focused and listens to the true Dharma, the Five Hindrances are absent at that moment. In this state free from the Five Hindrances, the Seven Factors of Awakening can be cultivated to fulfillment, further consolidating the foundation for wisdom and liberation.

XII.2  Confirming the State of Dwelling in Well-Being  
When a practitioner, through wise attention, skillfully cultivates the Seven Factors of Awakening, not only can the unarisen factors arise and the arisen factors reach fulfillment, but they can also in this way confirm that they have reached the state of dwelling in well-being. The characteristic of dwelling in well-being is that the mind is not covered by the Five Hindrances and is endowed with the brightness and stability of the Seven Factors of Awakening.

XIII.  The Calm and Clear Insight That Should Be Cultivated, and the Wrong Searches and Idle Talk That Should Not

XIII.1  What Should Be Cultivated: Calm and Clear Insight  
In the overall path of practice, what should be cultivated is nothing other than calm (samatha) and clear insight (vipassanā). Calm makes the mind stable and serene, providing the basis for the concentration and tranquility factors; clear insight enables the mind to see things as they really are, aligning with the mindfulness and discrimination-of-states factors. When calm and clear insight are combined and mutually support the cultivation of the Seven Factors of Awakening, the whole practice becomes stable and comprehensive.

XIII.2  Wrong Searches and False Views That Should Be Avoided  
On the right path of practice, one must avoid certain things that harm practice. These include unwholesome searches and reflections, such as reflection on sensuality, on ill will, and on harming; they also include unwholesome reflections concerning wrong views—for example, eternalism and annihilationism, or views about the world having an end or no end—false opinions of this sort. Furthermore, argumentative debates aimed at victory in contention, and beastly topics of worldly idle chatter, should all be avoided. Such unwholesome searching and idle talk will obstruct right reflection and hinder the arising of the Seven Factors of Awakening.

XIV.  Mindful Recollection of Wholesome Qualities and the Cessation of Bodily Pain

XIV.1  Using Recollection of Wholesome Qualities to Counteract Intense Bodily Pain  
When the body is undergoing intense pain, the practitioner should recollect the wholesome qualities already possessed and reflect on their characteristics. When the mind turns toward and abides in the wholesome qualities that have been accomplished, the pain immediately ceases. This method of counteracting pain through right faith and mindful recollection of wholesomeness aligns with the practice of the mindfulness and joy factors of awakening, preventing the mind from being overwhelmed by bodily pain and helping it abide in clarity and stability.

XIV.2  The Overall Status of the Five Hindrances and the Seven Factors of Awakening in Practice  
In summary, the Five Hindrances are an aggregation of unwholesome states and are the fundamental cause of non-wisdom and suffering; the Seven Factors of Awakening are the constituents of awakening and the fundamental cause of wisdom and liberation. By cutting off the Five Hindrances and cultivating the Seven Factors of Awakening, and on the basis of moral discipline, calm, and clear insight, grounding practice in seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and directing it toward equanimity, the practitioner can move from obstruction to liberation, from darkness to light, and ultimately head toward, incline toward, and draw near to nirvana.
