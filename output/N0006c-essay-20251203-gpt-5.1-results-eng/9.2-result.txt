<title> The Complete Continuum of Practice and Liberation </title>
<article>
I. Giving, Wholesome Deeds, and the Overall Orientation of Practice  
In spiritual practice, giving and wholesome deeds are regarded as an important starting point leading toward liberation. When a person is able to diligently act in accordance with the true Dharma, and thereby gains the karmic result of giving, he acquires the capacity to transcend the Yāma Heaven and the Vaitaraṇī River and take rebirth in the heavenly realms. Among these, giving that is carried out based on right faith, and giving in the form of the Dharma (using Dharma verses as what is given), are especially noble and precious. In past lives, those wise and good people relied precisely on such lawful, faith-based material giving and Dharma-giving as a foundation, step by step progressing toward the final fruit of Nirvāṇa. Viewed as a whole, the ultimate orientation of practice does not lie in any single wholesome deed by itself, but in using giving and various wholesome deeds to gradually accomplish the path of disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation—ultimately fully understanding suffering and entering upon the path to Nirvāṇa.

II. Fundamental Virtues, Few Desires, Contentment, and Self-Restraint  
A practitioner who perfects virtue must possess several fundamental qualities: wisdom, fewness of desires, energy, and the ability to teach effectively. One who has these virtues will inevitably be appreciated and praised by those who are not foolish, not defiled, and not mentally distracted; his virtuous conduct shines with a pure radiance like a precious jewel. The principles of wisdom can be applied broadly to mental qualities, enabling the mind to be well-tamed and to show profound penetration in various attainments of practice. The principles of having few desires are manifested in being free from anger and having a gentle disposition. The principles of skillful instruction appear in taking on and carrying out the teacher’s instructions, and in receiving universal respect in the world. One who is truly skilled in self-protection knows how to restrain body, speech, mind, and all actions; only in this way can he truly be called someone who knows shame and guards his own mind.

III. Correctly Understanding Sense Pleasures and Wholesome States  
A practitioner must clearly understand that worldly sense pleasures are not genuine happiness, and, in the course of practice, must be able to discern various disturbances and rely on wisdom to see reality as it truly is. Even with regard to wholesome states themselves, there exist fundamental cognitive obstacles: such obstacles make it hard for people to recognize what wholesome states are and to understand what constitutes a wholesome teaching. Once these obstacles are overcome, one can truly understand the content of wholesome states and grasp the correct meaning indicated by wholesome teachings. The entire system of practice is like agriculture: mental cultivation is like farming and must have specific conditions and methods—first ploughing the soil, then sowing, irrigating, and protecting the crop—so that, in the end, one can harvest the fruit of liberation from birth and death.

IV. Forest Seclusion, Mindfulness and Stillness, and the Alms-Mendicant Holy Life  
In concrete forms of practice, practitioners often choose to sit cross-legged in the forest, keeping the body upright and dignified, establishing mindfulness within, and dwelling unshaken—thus observing body and mind in the midst of silence. Even if one adopts alms-begging as a way of life, one cannot claim to be a bhikkhu merely on the basis of going to others to ask for food. A true bhikkhu is not defined by outward form, but by whether his lifestyle is supported by right view, right mindfulness, and the holy life. Seclusion and seated meditation, combined with the establishment of mindfulness, are key conditions for deepening contemplation and dispassion.

V. Factors for Seeing Reality as It Is, and the Right Use of Requisites  
In order to gain direct seeing of reality, a practitioner must acquire and put into practice thirteen factors. These include seeking out a teacher, study, yogic practice, desire (for wholesome practice), effort, non-retreating, fervor, energy, steadfastness, right mindfulness, right intention, and non-negligence. These conditions mutually support one another so that the practitioner maintains a non-retreating direction and strength. On the level of daily life, the requisites upon which practitioners rely mainly include clothing, food, bedding and seats for sitting and lying down, and medicines and related supplies for illness. One must have a correct attitude toward these requisites. This correct attitude should be applied universally to all categories of requisites: being content with what is obtained, not being bound by them, and not allowing them to give rise to craving and dependence. Practitioners must learn and embody this lifestyle of contentment and non-attachment, letting material requisites serve only as support for the path, not as bondage.

VI. Self-Restraint, Confession, and Simple, Austere Conduct  
When a practitioner is able to recognize his own faults as faults and confess them in accordance with the Dharma, he can subsequently enter into a state of self-restraint and gain real benefit within the discipline of the Noble Ones. The practical key to a life of practice lies in learning to live in a simple and austere manner—remaining alert and not negligent, and continuing to practice diligently with a fervent and focused mind. To truly be in accord with the original intention of going forth, one must completely abandon inappropriate adornments and desires, and thoroughly put into action the corresponding simple and austere way of living—so that external decoration, ornamentation, and various worldly desires do not obscure the core orientation toward liberation.

VII. The Framework for Contemplating Phenomena, Combinations of Samādhi, and Universal Principles  
Within the framework for contemplating phenomena, there are seven modes of cognition that can be applied universally to each of the five aggregates. Although the five aggregates differ in their essential definitions and in the specific conditions for their arising and cessation, they are exactly the same in four aspects: the path leading to their cessation, the function of attachment to them, the dangers inherent in them, and the methods for transcending them. Correspondingly, there are eight different combinations of the capacities of samādhi, and each combination presents the four types of structure just described, enabling the practitioner to experience and understand how meditative absorption operates from multiple perspectives. All of these fundamental principles can be universally applied to the various specific scopes of practice and contemplation that have been listed. For each item, one must go through a complete process of knowing, understanding, becoming dispassionate toward, and abandoning it in order to reach finality.

VIII. Solitary Reflection, the Cessation of the Six Sense Bases, and the Path to Nirvāṇa  
The dedicated cultivation of solitary reflection has extremely high central value, because it is through quiet seclusion and solitary contemplation that one can know all things as they truly are. In this process, it is essential to give importance to the cultivation and realization of the six sense bases: the complete cessation of the six sense bases is the state of dispassion, and this state of dispassion is the object that practitioners must know and master. When a practitioner guards the six sense bases with mindfulness and firmly resolves to use this guarding as the concrete goal of tending toward cessation, then he can genuinely move toward liberation. Thus it can be understood that the various processes of contemplation and practice described above constitute the definite path leading to the accomplishment of Nirvāṇa. In order to avoid the arising of dependency and attachment within the holy life, practitioners should cultivate a holy life that “does not dwell inwardly and has no model to cling to.” If there is inward dwelling and reliance in practice, and if the mind clings to some fixed image of a “model” or standard, this will lead to suffering and instability. By contrast, when there is no inward dwelling and no model to cling to, one can attain stability and happiness.

IX. Contemplation of Arising and Ceasing, Abiding with a Mind Free from Signs, and the Noble Eightfold Path  
The attainment of purified vision depends on seeing the arising and ceasing of all phenomena as they truly are. Only through such contemplation of arising and ceasing can delusion and attachment be completely cut off. In the process of realization, the principle of “abiding with a mind free from signs” has universal applicability. In the initial stage, one must first overcome attachment to material perceptions and mental activities—that is, practicing “freedom from signs” with respect to various appearances. In the stage of counteracting defilements, one must concentrate and abide in meditative absorption so that the mind does not follow external conditions, taking “abiding of mind” as the core. In the stage of accomplishment, freedom from signs and abiding of mind become completely unified: one is neither confused by appearances, nor fails to abide in a stable, clear one-pointedness. Relying on such training, together with cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path, practitioners can fully understand suffering. Thus, thoroughly understanding suffering does not come from mere thinking; one must actually cultivate this Noble Eightfold Path—letting right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right samādhi be concretely enacted in daily life.

X. Bound Mindfulness and Unbound Mindfulness, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, and Three Types of Seeking  
In terms of meditative methods, there are two paths of cultivation: bound mindfulness and unbound mindfulness. Practitioners should meditate under a tree or in other vacant, quiet places. Regardless of which method is adopted, one must stay far from negligence, not be led by laziness, and avoid later regret. When, through the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness, a practitioner gradually attains a state of self-reliance and reliance on the Dharma, he can be said to have accomplished the highest mode of practice among practitioners. At the same time, regarding the three kinds of seeking, there are clear domains of cultivation: practitioners must discern the nature of these seekings, and use mindfulness and wisdom to contemplate and tame them, so that seeking no longer becomes a source of confusion for the mind.

XI. Mindfulness of Breathing, Great Fruits and Great Merits, and the Cessation of Fears  
If one follows the appropriate methods of practice and makes great efforts to cultivate mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, one can obtain great fruits and great merits. Such practice not only brings great benefit and great security; it also becomes the basis for great disenchantment and great pleasant abiding in the future. At the same time, practice also aims at security in this life and in future lives: through specific right conduct, five kinds of fears and hostilities resulting from certain actions can be brought to cessation, so that fears, enmities, and mental pain that might arise in this life and the next are calmed. Furthermore, noble disciples should accomplish the four factors of stream-entry, so that their faith and practice gain a stable foundation, and they can correctly observe and penetrate the principles realized by the Noble Ones with wisdom.

XII. Merit, Heavenly Paths, and the Status of Lay Followers  
In the building of merit and happiness, four kinds of actions can bring blessings and wholesome results and serve as the basis of happiness. These four kinds of Dharma are at the same time sources of merit that provide nourishment for the wholesome and provisions for happiness. As for practice directed toward rebirth in heavenly realms, there are four heavenly-path practices that can purify beings who were not previously pure and make unwhitened beings attain a purified heart. Among these, the heavenly path of non-ill-will has universal applicability: it applies not only to all practices that arise from faith—such as faith in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha—but also to the practice of moral precepts, and is regarded as the common core of the methods that accomplish the heavenly path. All who take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha are called lay followers (upāsaka/upāsikā). The establishment of this status marks that they take the Three Jewels as their refuge and have begun to walk the path of right faith in the midst of ordinary worldly life.

XIII. The Fruit of Stream-Entry, the Four Noble Truths, and Mutual Encouragement in Practice  
If a noble disciple can fully accomplish four core principles, he can realize the fruit of stream-entry, escape inevitable downfall, be firmly established on the right path, and move toward final awakening. Therefore, regarding the nature of suffering, one should mutually encourage each other to recognize it; regarding the origin of suffering, one should mutually encourage each other to cut it off; regarding the cessation of suffering, one should mutually encourage each other to realize it; regarding the path leading to cessation, one should mutually encourage each other to cultivate it. The acceptance and upholding of the Four Noble Truths must be thus rational and steadfast. Concerning the Four Noble Truths, there are also two universal principles. One is the principle of oneness, which applies universally to the four aspects of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. The other is the principle of practice, which likewise applies universally to these four truths. In other words, with respect to suffering itself, the arising of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering, one must, based on the same principle and with practice as the core, truly know, truly abandon, truly realize, and truly cultivate. Therefore, regarding suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering, one should exert effort; and regarding the insight and experience that “this is suffering,” “this is the origin of suffering,” “this is the cessation of suffering,” and “this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,” one should exert effort in cultivation and implementation. Furthermore, concerning the ten matters that should be avoided, there is also a universally applicable principle: all of these items that should be avoided manifest the same pattern—those who are able to avoid them are very few, while those who are unable to avoid them are very many—reminding practitioners not to underestimate the power of defilement and attachment.

XIV. Invitation to Admonition, Ordination, and Contemplation of Dependent Origination  
In community life within the Saṅgha, the practice of invitation to admonition (pravāraṇā) has special significance and method. In specific assemblies, practitioners must openly invite others to examine their conduct, with the purpose of purifying bodily and verbal actions. In practice, the preceptor first inquires of the disciples about their assessment of his own conduct; the disciples truthfully report the results of their examination. Afterwards, the disciples likewise request the preceptor to examine their conduct, serving as mutual admonition. If practitioners from other traditions wish to go forth in this true Dharma, they must first undergo a period of “residing separately” as a trial. After they pass the test, they are then conferred full ordination, thus formally joining the pure Saṅgha. When contemplating dependent origination, one must take the phenomena that bind and fetter as objects of contemplation, and, under the general principles of contemplating the four kinds of “nutriments,” understand the true nature of each “nutriment.” When one can see the true reality of a particular nutriment, one can understand the category of defilements or phenomena directly related to it, and thereby cut off the corresponding reliance and attachment.

XV. Three Types of Bhikkhus and Practice on the Links of Dependent Origination  
In the practice and accomplishment of the path of liberation, bhikkhus can be classified according to three standards. The first is the “Dharma-teaching bhikkhu”: he can expound, with respect to a given Dharma, the path that leads to disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation. The second is the “bhikkhu who practices the Dharma and follows the Dharma”: he not only listens and understands, but can truly put into practice disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to a given Dharma. The third is the “bhikkhu who attains Nirvāṇa in this very life”: by means of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to a given Dharma, he reaches the state of no more clinging, with a mind that is liberated. Such practice is not limited to a few aspects, but can be applied to every link of dependent origination—from aging-and-death, birth, existence, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, volitional activities, all the way to ignorance. Each link can serve as a specific object for contemplation and the cutting off of clinging.

XVI. Mindset When Entering Households and Equality in Receiving and Accepting  
When a practitioner enters lay households, especially when begging for food or receiving offerings, his mental attitude must be extremely cautious. If his mind holds specific expectations—for example, that he must receive alms, must receive much, must receive high-quality alms, must receive quickly, must receive with respect—then, if these expectations are not fulfilled, he will easily become angry when he receives no alms, little alms, coarse alms, slow alms, or disrespectful alms, thus experiencing sorrow and suffering in his heart, letting his mind follow external conditions, and generating various pains and afflictions. Conversely, a proper mindset when entering households is to reflect reasonably on the benefits of giving, but not to cling to the result. Even if he receives no alms or what he receives is not as desired, he does not give rise to affliction or anger, but can maintain inner calm, not allowing external changes to become the source of inner sorrow and suffering. In concrete behavior, this correct mindset appears as an attitude of equality toward offerings: regardless of receiving much or little, the mind does not make distinctions; receiving fine or coarse, there is no picking and choosing; receiving quickly or slowly, no urgency arises; receiving respectfully or casually, no calculation arises. In terms of inner cultivation, it is to prevent the mind from changing with external conditions, to maintain purity and stability, to be far from craving and anger, and to uphold right mindfulness and clear comprehension. One who becomes an exemplar in practice is someone who, with this correct mindset, enters lay households and remains calm amid all situations, not letting the presence, amount, quality, or manner of offerings shake his heart. Other practitioners should learn from such an exemplary attitude, implement the rightly taught conduct, and concretely embody it in their daily lives.

XVII. Forest-Dwelling Practitioners and the Trap of Gain, Offerings, and Fame  
As exemplary practitioners, their core qualities include dwelling in forest hermitages and other quiet places, living by alms-begging, wearing rag-robes, keeping to three robes, having few desires and contentment, staying far from crowds, not engaging extensively in worldly socializing, and practicing diligently. They are often respected by elder practitioners, invited to sit, praised as fortunate, and recognized as eager learners who courageously walk the path. However, material gain, offerings, and fame can become a grave danger for practitioners. Some people were originally able to maintain a true mind and not tell lies. Even when faced with great temptations—such as extremely precious objects, vast profits, threats to their lives, or the lure of sensual beauty—they could still firmly uphold their integrity without wavering. Yet later they fell due to gain, offerings, and fame: their minds were dazzled, and in the end they lost their true mind and spoke falsehood. This shows that if gain and fame are not guarded against and counteracted, they are enough to undermine a previously pure holy life.

XVIII. Observation across All Times and Spaces, and the Danger of Laziness and Negligence  
In terms of contemplative method, practitioners should grasp principles that pervade everything. In the dimension of time, they must be able to observe past, present, and future. In the dimension of place, they must be able to contemplate inner and outer phenomena. In terms of forms, they must encompass all manifestations—coarse and subtle, inferior and superior, far and near. Such all-encompassing observation across all times, places, and forms helps prevent one from being blinded by partial experience. At the same time, one must understand that laziness and negligence will invite harm: when practitioners become weak, seek only bodily comfort and enjoyment, indulge in pleasure and abandon vigilance, and become lazy and negligent, external aggressors can easily find opportunities to invade, destroying their physical and mental stability. Therefore, energy and non-negligence are not only virtues of practice; they are also practical lines of defense that protect one from inner and outer dangers.

XIX. Going Forth, Solitary Dwelling, and Non-Contention  
To accomplish the holy life, one must leave the worldly household and live the pure life of one without a home, pursuing the supreme and ultimate holy life. In outward form, a solitary dweller enters the village for alms alone, acts alone, sits alone in a quiet place, and walks meditation alone, thereby distancing the mind from crowds and noise and making it easier to concentrate and contemplate. “Frequenting villages” means interacting excessively with laypeople, sharing in the same joys and sorrows as they, and spending one’s efforts on their various affairs. Not frequenting villages means not overly socializing with laypeople, not generating the same emotional responses, and not expending effort on their affairs, thus avoiding being entangled in human matters to the detriment of practice. Regarding debates with others, “quarreling with people” means judging others with words as not understanding the Dharma and discipline, considering oneself right and accusing others of being wrong, and demanding that others concede defeat. “Not quarreling with people” means not judging others with words, not considering oneself right and accusing others, and not demanding that others submit—thereby returning practice to inner taming and self-purification rather than outward winning of arguments.

XX. Contemplations Directed toward Disenchantment and the Nature of Harmful Thoughts  
In a correct contemplative attitude, one should guide oneself toward disenchantment and dispassion with regard to all phenomena currently being experienced, ultimately aiming at the cessation of defilements, rather than continuing to face the present with craving and grasping. The core operating principle of all harmful thoughts is that, once they arise, they inflict very deep harm upon oneself; their function is like holding an inverted bamboo fruit in one’s hand—because the shell of the fruit is sharp on the outside, it ends up stabbing the holder himself. This simile shows that the nature of malignant mental states is not merely one-way harm toward others, but first and foremost a backlash against oneself, causing short-term and long-term pain and loss for the practitioner.

XXI. Wide-Ranging Contemplation of Time and Space, and Direct Knowing of the Six Sense-Contacts  
Regarding the temporal dimension of observation, one must clearly grasp the three times—past, future, and present. At the same time, one must also reflect from the perspective of spatial attributes: including all phenomena that are inner and outer, coarse and subtle, inferior and superior, remote and near. Such broad and meticulous observation helps to break through bias and limitation. Furthermore, among the core conditions for liberation, direct knowing of the six kinds of sense-contact is particularly important. Practitioners must truly know the arising, cessation, sweetness, danger, and escape with respect to the six sense-contacts. If they cannot know in this way, the holy life has not yet been completed, and the way of liberation remains far away. In other words, without comprehensive understanding of the six sense-contacts, one cannot truly complete the holy life or draw near to the true Dharma.

XXII. Negligence and Non-Negligence, Maintenance of the Holy Life, and Contemplation of the Six Sense Bases  
In the concrete process of practice, whether certain Dharmas are present or absent directly defines the practitioner’s status and condition. If these Dharmas are not present, it indicates that the person is dwelling in negligence; if they are present, it indicates that the person is dwelling in non-negligence. Regarding the maintenance of the holy life, there are clear fundamental principles: if one follows three specific conditions, one can maintain an extremely pure holy life flawlessly throughout one’s entire life. Conversely, if one violates these three conditions, one cannot maintain a completely pure holy life throughout life. Although the concrete content of these three is not elaborated here one by one, their benefits and consequences are quite evident. On the other hand, the principle of contemplating the six sense bases as suffering is itself a complete path of practice that leads to Nirvāṇa. Likewise, the principle of contemplating the six sense bases as impermanent is also a complete path of practice that leads to Nirvāṇa. Observing the six sense bases from the dual angles of suffering and impermanence can shatter the illusions of permanence, happiness, self, and purity, and guide the mind toward liberation.

XXIII. Benefits of Non-Negligence in This Life and the Next, Worldly Baits, and This Shore and the Far Shore  
The benefits of non-negligence are very evident both in this life and in future lives. In this life, non-negligence can make life long, the body relatively free from illness, appearance upright and beautiful, everyday wishes fulfilled, and provide the opportunity to be born into a noble family. In the future, non-negligence enables practitioners to be reborn in heavenly realms, enjoying more favorable conditions for practice. Conversely, there are six kinds of worldly baits that lead beings into misfortune and ruin. They are like traps that entice people with temporary sweetness but conceal great dangers beneath. A core principle of the path of liberation points out that whether a practitioner remains sunk on this shore or arrives at the far shore depends on how he practices three aspects: guarding the senses, moderation in eating, and diligent cultivation of wakefulness. If various obstacles arise in these three—such as mental clinging, failure to observe as-it-really-is, failure to abandon obstructive states, following desires, directing the mind toward sense-objects, and not carrying out the path of liberation—then one will inevitably remain sunk on this shore. If, on the other hand, one achieves non-clinging, as-it-really-is observation, abandonment of obstructive states, non-compliance with desires, turning the mind away from sense-objects, and actual implementation of the path of liberation, then one can cross from this shore to the far shore.

XXIV. The Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, Use of Supernormal Powers, and Solitary Practice  
At higher levels of meditative absorption, practitioners must master a principle of mental operation: to establish, focus, and maintain the mind in the sphere of infinite consciousness so that the mind abides, unscattered, in the boundless field of consciousness. In this state, one must pay particular attention not to become negligent with respect to the sphere of infinite consciousness, otherwise one will lose clarity at a subtle level. Regarding the use of supernormal powers, practitioners should take humility and restraint as their principles: satisfying others’ needs at proper times is sufficient; one should not flaunt these abilities or crave display. Once necessary tasks are completed, one should stop, not allowing supernormal powers to become a new source of clinging. In daily practice, one should still dwell alone in quiet places, devote oneself to cultivation, not cling to any specific dwelling place, and strive to maintain singleness and purity of mind.

XXV. The Holy Vehicle, the Seven Factors of Awakening, and the Five and Three Faculties  
The Noble Eightfold Path is not only the route to liberation but is also called the “holy vehicle” and the “Dharma vehicle,” the supreme path of mastery among all vehicles. In cultivating the seven factors of awakening, there are several core principles that must be grasped. The first is the principle of flexible cultivation: the practitioner can, at any time, according to his intention, focus and cultivate any one of the awakening factors, making the training both flexible and continuous. The second is the principle of recognizing three phases: for any awakening factor, one must clearly recognize three states—when it has definitely arisen, when it has arisen well and is steadily maintained, and when it declines due to specific conditions. These two principles apply universally to all seven factors of awakening, enabling practitioners to constantly observe and adjust their mental processes. When the mind is sluggish or withdrawn, one should emphasize the cultivation of the factors of investigation-of-Dharma, energy, and joy, and should not emphasize the factors of tranquility, concentration, and equanimity. When the mind is agitated, one should focus on cultivating tranquility, concentration, and equanimity, and temporarily not emphasize investigation-of-Dharma, energy, and joy. Such taming and counteraction bring great fruits and great merits, as well as great benefit, great security, great disenchantment, and great pleasant abiding. The principles for cultivating the seven factors of awakening and subduing fundamental defilements can also be applied universally to the broader contents discussed in each section; their core aim is to subdue sensual desire so that the mind gradually departs from craving.

XXVI. Not Relying on External Authority, the Perfectly Enlightened One, and the Five and Three Faculties  
Regarding the fundamental basis of reliance in practice, the teaching does not encourage dependence on external authority. This is because within the teaching there is no division between inner and outer secret doctrines, nor is there any absolutely supreme “teacher-lord” authority. The Enlightened One does not regard himself as ruling over practitioners, nor does he think that practitioners must depend on him; rather, he guides beings to rely on the true Dharma and their own awareness. To become a perfectly enlightened Buddha, several key elements are required: cutting off mental defilements and the five hindrances, binding the mind to the four foundations of mindfulness, and cultivating the seven factors of awakening—step by step realizing unsurpassed perfect awakening. Correspondingly, the content of the five spiritual faculties must also be clearly understood: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. Among these, the faculty of mindfulness is the capacity for focused and clear awareness; the faculty of concentration is the capacity to keep the mind stable and unmoving; the faculty of wisdom is a capacity for seeing reality as it truly is. Once these faculties are mature, they can lead the practitioner to orient toward Nirvāṇa, incline toward Nirvāṇa, and approach entry into Nirvāṇa, so that the entire weight of life is completely shifted toward liberation.

XXVII. Concentration through Mindfulness of Breathing, and the Contrast between Lay and Monastic Life  
To accomplish the various benefits described above, practitioners, when cultivating concentration through mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, should go to quiet places such as remote forests, the foot of a tree, or an empty hut and there practice with focused attention—learning to observe and relinquish the in-breath in calm, and to observe and relinquish the out-breath in calm, so that the mind, in the arising and passing of the breath, gains insight into impermanence and non-self. It is not hard to see that lay life is mostly turbulent—a place where dust accumulates and various desires and attachments are intricately entangled. By contrast, a life of monastic practice is leisurely and quiet, making it easier for the mind to settle and observe. From this there also arises a fundamental distinction concerning the “path upward”: a false path upward regards external behavior alone as the method of liberation, lacking a foundation of inner realization, and therefore cannot lead to genuine liberation. The true path upward possesses a complete sequence of training, taking inner realization as its core and ultimately leading to final Nirvāṇa.

XXVIII. Wholesome and Unwholesome States, and Wholesome and Unwholesome Practitioners  
There is a corresponding relationship between Dharma and practitioners. If a teaching is unwholesome, it is an unwholesome discourse and unwholesome demonstration: it cannot accomplish renunciation and cannot support tranquility. An unwholesome practitioner follows such unwholesome teachings in his actions, like bad seed sown in bad soil, which naturally cannot grow. Conversely, wholesome Dharma is a wholesome discourse and a wholesome demonstration; it can accomplish renunciation and support tranquility. A wholesome practitioner follows such Dharma in his conduct, like good seed sown in good soil, which will surely grow and greatly increase. Therefore, all the wholesome Dharmas mentioned earlier, once their qualities are recollected, can bring about the cessation of suffering; each recollection of a wholesome Dharma can independently produce the function of ending suffering.

XXIX. Accomplishing Wisdom and Obstacles to Recognizing Wholesome States  
To accomplish wisdom, there is a fundamental path of practice consisting of four steps: associating with good and wise friends, listening to the true Dharma, wise reflection, and practicing in accordance with the Dharma. By cultivating and repeatedly practicing these four steps, one can gradually accomplish wisdom of various kinds. However, if certain obstacles are present, they will make it difficult for a person to recognize wholesome states and impossible to understand wholesome teachings, and may even distort his judgment and response to the true Dharma. Therefore, removing obstacles and establishing the correct sequence of reliance is the fundamental starting point of cultivating wisdom.

XXX. Conclusion: Taking Nirvāṇa as the Ultimate Direction  
Surveying all of the above teachings—whether the starting point of giving and wholesome deeds, the foundation of virtue and fewness of desires, the correct understanding of sense pleasures and wholesome states, the practice of forest seclusion and the alms-mendicant holy life, contentment with and non-attachment to requisites, the benefits of self-restraint and confession, the frameworks for contemplating phenomena and the universal principles of combinations of samādhi, or the practice of solitary reflection, the cessation of the six sense bases, abiding with a mind free from signs, and the Noble Eightfold Path; as well as the practice of invitation to admonition, going forth and receiving ordination, contemplation of dependent origination, the classification of three types of bhikkhus, the correct mindset when entering households, the example of forest-dwelling practitioners, the benefits of non-negligence, direct knowing of the six sense-contacts, the cultivation of the seven factors of awakening and the five (and three) faculties, and the power of the true path upward and the recollection of wholesome Dharmas—all of these, without exception, point toward the same ultimate direction: thoroughly knowing suffering, cutting off the origin of suffering, realizing the cessation of suffering, and cultivating the path that leads to the cessation of suffering, ultimately realizing Nirvāṇa. This overall framework outlines a complete path that begins with giving and morality, proceeds through the cultivation of concentration and wisdom, gradually departs from worldly defilements and inner stains, and finally abides in unsurpassed liberation.
