<title> The Complete Principles of Dependent Origination, Its Cessation, and Middle‑Way Liberation </title>
<article>
I. The Starting Point of Non‑Abiding in Stillness and the Practice of Liberation  

I.1 Transcending the Torrent through Non‑Abiding and Non‑Seeking  
At the beginning of the path of liberation, what is first emphasized is the principle of “non‑abiding in stillness.” Non‑abiding means not generating clinging fixation to any state, not settling down upon anything obtained; non‑seeking means not chasing after any object or state with a greedy, grasping mind. Only by neither clinging to any point of abiding, nor racing outward with a mind of craving, can one transcend the torrential rush of birth and death, cross over the dangerous flood of samsaric life and death, and no longer be swept away by it.

I.2 Methods of Liberation and the Cessation of Reliance  
In actual practice for liberation, the core of the method is to know, just as they are, the causes for the arising of all phenomena, and to completely extinguish their root cause. Liberation is not achieved merely by suppression or escape, but by wisely discerning dependent origination, clearly seeing how every phenomenon arises conditioned by causes, and eradicating those causes at their root.  

When there is something for the mind to rely on, the mind will move and turn; where there is any support, there will be grasping and fluctuation. When all reliance has completely ceased and there is nowhere to lean, this movement and turning no longer occurs; the mind is no longer driven or pushed. This is an important aspect of the principle of liberation.

I.3 Non‑Abiding of Consciousness and States of Stillness  
In the functioning of consciousness, if consciousness abides and grows with respect to any object, it becomes a condition for future rebirth. Conversely, if consciousness does not abide, it no longer constructs the basis for future arising. When consciousness no longer abides anywhere at all, then there is no future rebirth; with no more rebirth, there is no more birth and aging‑and‑death, and at the same time sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress are extinguished, thereby achieving the complete ending of the whole mass of suffering.

Related to this there is a more detailed explanation of states of stillness and the arising of feeling:  

When desire, thinking, and perception have not yet become still, feeling arises with these three as conditions. When desire has become still but thinking and perception have not yet become still, feeling still arises with thinking and perception as its conditions. When desire and thinking have both become still, but perception has not yet become still, feeling then arises with the not‑yet‑stilled perception as its condition. And even when desire, thinking, and perception have all become still, still, based on that very stillness, corresponding feeling arises. From this it can be seen that feeling is in a tightly structured relation of dependent origination with the various moving or still states of the mind.

II. The Twelve Links of Dependent Origination and the Causal Chain of the Cessation of the Aggregate of Suffering  

II.1 The Sequence and Result of the Ending of Suffering  
Concerning how suffering is eliminated, the scriptures present a clear sequence: when ignorance is completely stilled and cut off, volitional activities cease; because volitional activities cease, consciousness ceases; because consciousness ceases, name‑and‑form ceases; because name‑and‑form ceases, the six bases cease; because the six bases cease, contact ceases; because contact ceases, feeling ceases; because feeling ceases, craving ceases; because craving ceases, clinging ceases; because clinging ceases, existence (becoming) ceases; because existence ceases, birth ceases; because birth ceases, aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress all cease.

This entire process is said to be the complete ending of the whole mass of suffering, the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering, the cessation of the whole aggregate of suffering; it is also the process of the complete extinction of the entire collection of suffering. Whether it is called “the whole mass of suffering,” “the entire aggregate of suffering,” or “the entire collection of suffering,” all of these refer to the totality formed by all aggregates of suffering and their accumulation, all of which are completely stilled in this chain of cessation.

II.2 The General Principle of the Cessation of Dependent Origination  
In the general teaching of dependent origination, the basic structure of cessation is pointed out: because of the complete fading away, dispassion, and cessation of ignorance, formations (volitional activities) cease; because formations cease, consciousness ceases; because consciousness ceases, name‑and‑form ceases; because name‑and‑form ceases, the six bases cease; because the six bases cease, contact ceases; because contact ceases, feeling ceases; because feeling ceases, craving ceases; because craving ceases, clinging ceases; because clinging ceases, existence ceases; because existence ceases, birth ceases; because birth ceases, aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress cease. This process is a complete description of the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering.

Here, an important principle is also explained: cessation proceeds by removing the condition in the previous link so that the subsequent link can come to rest. That is, the cessation of the prior factor results in the cessation of the later factor; each factor’s cessation is achieved because the previous factor has ceased. In this way, the complete stopping of the aggregate of suffering can be realized.  

When it is said that “the two‑way sequence of the law of dependent origination clearly regulates the logic of generation and cessation of all fundamental links,” this means that on the one hand there is the door of arising, “When this exists, that comes to be; when this arises, that arises,” starting from ignorance and step by step advancing until the whole mass of the aggregate of suffering is formed. On the other hand there is the door of cessation, “When this does not exist, that does not come to be; when this ceases, that ceases,” starting from the extinction of ignorance and step by step regressing to the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering. By extinguishing the root factor, ignorance, one can in due order bring to rest all process‑factors and result‑factors.

II.3 Investigating the Cessation of Suffering and the Reverse Sequence of Cessation  
To investigate the conditions under which suffering comes to an end, one must rely on right reflection and wisdom. When the twelve links of dependent origination are contemplated in reverse with wisdom, one can see: when ignorance ceases, formations cease; when formations cease, consciousness ceases; when consciousness ceases, name‑and‑form ceases; when name‑and‑form ceases, the six bases cease; when the six bases cease, contact ceases; when contact ceases, feeling ceases; when feeling ceases, craving ceases; when craving ceases, clinging ceases; when clinging ceases, existence ceases; when existence ceases, birth ceases; when birth ceases, aging‑and‑death and the whole mass of suffering cease. This reverse sequence of cessation clearly shows how the cessation of each link leads to the cessation of the link that follows it, ultimately arriving at the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering.

In another formulation, this is expressed as: “Because there is no ignorance, there are no formations; because there are no formations, there is no consciousness; because there is no consciousness, there is no name‑and‑form; because there is no name‑and‑form, there are no six bases; because there are no six bases, there is no contact; because there is no contact, there is no feeling; because there is no feeling, there is no craving; because there is no craving, there is no clinging; because there is no clinging, there is no existence; because there is no existence, there is no birth; because there is no birth, there is no aging‑and‑death.” This formulation emphasizes that when the preceding link is completely absent, the subsequent link no longer arises, whereby the cessation of the world is displayed as a clearly ordered causal sequence.

II.4 The Linked Cessation of Name‑and‑Form, the Six Bases, Contact, and Suffering  
In a more detailed description of the process of cessation, the relationship between name‑and‑form, the six bases, and contact is given special emphasis: when name‑and‑form ceases, the six bases cease; when the six bases cease, contact ceases; and so on, until birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress all cease. This is called the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering.  

Likewise, when the six sense‑contact‑bases cease, contact ceases; when contact ceases, feeling ceases; when feeling ceases, craving ceases; when craving ceases, clinging ceases; when clinging ceases, existence ceases; when existence ceases, birth ceases; when birth ceases, aging‑and‑death ceases. From this it can be seen how crucially important contact is in the arising of suffering: to understand the role of contact, and to bring about the cessation of its conditions so as to bring suffering to an end, is one of the important guiding principles in the practice of dependent origination; complete cessation of suffering, however, requires walking the entire chain of dependent origination in reverse along the path of practice.

Furthermore, in a special explanation of the cessation of dependent origination, it is pointed out that if name‑and‑form ceases, then consciousness ceases; if consciousness ceases, then name‑and‑form ceases. Name‑and‑form and consciousness are mutually dependent and condition each other; when either one comes to rest, the other no longer exists. In this way, by extension, the cessation of each link leads to the cessation of the links that follow it, and the accumulated result is the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering.

II.5 The Exhaustion of Ignorance and the Cessation of the Aggregate of Suffering: A Summary  
In many teachings it is repeatedly emphasized: due to the thorough extinction, distancing, and cessation of ignorance, formations are brought to cessation; the cessation of formations leads to the cessation of consciousness, and so on by degrees until the whole aggregate of suffering ceases. When ignorance is exhausted and craving cut off, formations cease; when formations cease, consciousness ceases; when consciousness ceases, name‑and‑form ceases; when name‑and‑form ceases, the six bases cease; when the six bases cease, contact ceases; when contact ceases, feeling ceases; when feeling ceases, craving ceases; when craving ceases, clinging ceases; when clinging ceases, existence ceases; when existence ceases, birth ceases; when birth ceases, aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress cease.  

This reverse sequence of cessation is, in different contexts, repeatedly described with phrases such as “the cessation of the aggregate of suffering,” “the complete ending of the entire aggregate of suffering,” and “the cessation of all suffering.” The meaning is the same: when root‑ignorance is completely severed, all defiled factors—whether causes, processes, or results—likewise all come to rest.

III. Craving, Clinging, Existence, and the Principles of the Accumulation and Cessation of the Aggregate of Suffering  

III.1 The Common Principle of the Accumulation and Cessation of the Aggregate of Suffering  
All phenomena of the five aggregates follow the principles of “arising” (accumulation) and “ceasing.” “Arising” refers to the coming into being of phenomena; “ceasing” refers to the coming to rest and ending of phenomena. As for the aggregate of suffering, its arising and cessation also follow a clear general rule: regarding things that can be clung to, if one dwells in contemplating their pleasures, craving will increase; if one dwells in contemplating their dangers and drawbacks, craving will come to rest.  

When one clings to the taste of pleasure in things taken up, craving for them increases; when one abides in observing the dangers and drawbacks of what is taken up, craving is extinguished. When craving arises, clinging arises; when craving ceases, clinging ceases. Clinging forms existence; when clinging ceases, existence ceases. Conditioned by existence, birth arises; conditioned by birth there arise aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress. When craving is fully relinquished, cut off, and ended, clinging is extinguished; when clinging ceases, existence ceases; when existence ceases, birth ceases; when birth ceases, aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress come to an end. Through such arising or ceasing, the whole accumulation of the aggregate of suffering and the complete ending of that aggregate are constituted.

III.2 The Chain from Craving, to Clinging, to Existence and Birth, and the Ending of Suffering  
In another explanation, the relation among craving, clinging, existence, birth, and aging‑and‑death is more concretely expressed: conditioned by craving, clinging arises; conditioned by clinging, existence arises; conditioned by existence, birth arises; conditioned by birth, there arise aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and distress.  

When one abides in the enjoyment of the taste of what is taken up, craving becomes strong; from craving there is clinging, from clinging there is existence, from existence there is birth, and from birth unfold all aging‑and‑death and manifold afflictions. Conversely, when one abides in contemplation of danger (drawbacks), craving ceases; with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases, and this is the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering. Another formulation states: conditioned by craving, clinging arises; conditioned by clinging, existence arises; conditioned by existence, life appears; conditioned by life, aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress arise. Because craving ceases, clinging comes to rest; because clinging ceases, existence comes to rest; because existence ceases, life comes to rest; because life ceases, aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress all come to rest.

All these explanations jointly point to one central principle: the key lies in the extinction of “craving.” If the craving that arises with respect to the six senses and their objects can be utterly abandoned, left behind, and extinguished, then with the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; with the cessation of clinging, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, birth ceases; with the cessation of birth, aging‑and‑death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despondency all cease; finally the entire aggregate of suffering is extinguished. This process is the “disappearance of suffering” and the “disappearance of the world.”

III.3 Name‑and‑Form, Birth and Death, and the Gathering and Dispersal of the Aggregate of Suffering  
On the level of name‑and‑form, there is also a corresponding set of principles for its arising and ceasing. For the realm to which one is bound, if inwardly one abides in liking and tasting its pleasures, name‑and‑form will arise; for the realm to which one is bound, if inwardly one abides in contemplating its dangers and drawbacks, name‑and‑form will be completely extinguished. In other words, conditioned by tasting the pleasures of a sphere, name‑and‑form becomes manifest; conditioned by contemplating its dangers, name‑and‑form no longer appears.  

Furthermore, conditioned by the existence of name‑and‑form, the six sense‑bases arise; conditioned by the cessation of name‑and‑form, the six sense‑bases cease. Thus, by mutual conditioning in this way, the complete aggregate of suffering is accumulated; and by mutual cessation in this way, the complete aggregate of suffering is brought to rest.

III.4 Food and the Principle of the Cessation of the Abiding of Consciousness  
In addition, there is a principle of cessation that takes “food” as its core. Concerning any kind of food, if there is no greed, delight, or love, then there will be no abiding and growth of consciousness; without the abiding and growth of consciousness, there will be no manifestation of name‑and‑form; without the manifestation of name‑and‑form, there will be no intensification of formations; without a strengthening of formations, there will be no future renewed becoming; without future renewed becoming, there will be no future birth and aging‑and‑death; without future birth and aging‑and‑death, there will be no sorrow, pain, or affliction.  

This rule of cessation applies universally when there is non‑craving toward any of the four kinds of food—namely solid food, contact as food, mental intention as food, and consciousness as food. In every case the same chain of cessation is followed, ultimately leading to the ending of suffering.

IV. Name‑and‑Form, Consciousness, and the Arising and Cessation of the Five Aggregates  

IV.1 The Interdependent Relationship of Name‑and‑Form, Consciousness, the Six Bases, and Contact  
In discussing the arising and cessation of the five aggregates, it is first pointed out how the aggregate of suffering accumulates: conditioned by ignorance, formations (actions) arise; conditioned by formations, consciousness arises; then through the mutual conditioning of consciousness and name‑and‑form, the six bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, aging‑and‑death, and so on, all arise, thereby constituting the entire gathering of the aggregate of suffering. Conversely, the procedure of cessation is this: due to the complete cutting off of ignorance and the cessation of craving, formations come to rest; because formations come to rest, consciousness comes to rest, and so on by stages—this is the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering.

Elsewhere it is said that the aggregate of suffering arises: from the mutual conditioning of consciousness and name‑and‑form there are, in sequence, the arising of the six bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, and aging‑and‑death. The aggregate of suffering ceases: through the mutual cessation of consciousness and name‑and‑form, in sequence the six bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, and aging‑and‑death are brought to rest. It is thus clear that the mutual dependence and mutual conditioning between consciousness and name‑and‑form occupy a central position in the entire arising and cessation of the five aggregates.

IV.2 The Causes for Birth and the Conditions for Its Ending  
Regarding the dependent arising and the cessation of “birth” itself, there is also a clear explanation: birth has “existence” as its fundamental condition; existence has “clinging” as its fundamental condition; clinging has “craving” as its fundamental condition; craving has “feeling” as its fundamental condition. In other words, one must discern both the causes for birth and the conditions for its cessation: birth arises from existence, and ceases with the cessation of existence. At the point where the conditions are extinguished, one clearly knows the truth that “birth is ended.” This is one of the core methods for realizing and knowing liberation.

IV.3 Path‑Sequence Factors and Inner Experience  
Along the sequence of the path of cessation there is another set of concrete factors that is pointed out, showing the evolution of inner experience in the process of liberation: first there is suffering; by directly experiencing suffering as it is, faith arises; from faith comes joy (gladness); from joy arises rapture (delight); from rapture comes tranquility; from tranquility arises happiness; from happiness one enters samādhi (concentration); within samādhi, true seeing‑and‑knowing (direct knowledge) arises; from true seeing‑and‑knowing comes disenchantment; from disenchantment comes dispassion; from dispassion comes liberation; in the end, the knowledge of cessation (knowledge that the taints are destroyed) is realized.  

Thus, starting from the experience of suffering, going through faith, joy, rapture, tranquility, happiness, and meditative concentration, and arriving at true seeing‑and‑knowing, then disenchantment, dispassion, liberation, and knowledge of cessation, we have a complete inner sequence of the path of cultivation.

V. Right View of the Middle Way and the Teaching of Freedom from the Two Extremes  

V.1 Right View that Is Free from the Two Extremes of Existence and Non‑Existence  
In the principles of right view, there is first mention of an approach that transcends the two extremes of “existence” and “non‑existence.” When one observes the arising of the world with correct wisdom, one knows that this is not a nihilistic “nothing at all.” When one observes the cessation of the world with correct wisdom, one knows that this is also not an eternalistic “always existing, never ceasing.” In this way, one is freed from the two extreme views that “everything truly exists” and that “nothing at all exists.”  

In other words, by right wisdom observing, just as it is, the arising of the world, “nihilistic view” does not arise; by right wisdom observing, just as it is, the cessation of the world, “eternalist view” does not arise. To be free from the two extremes of “existence” and “non‑existence” is to abide in the Middle Way.

V.2 Letting Go of the Extremes of “Self‑Doing” and “Other‑Doing,” and of “Same” and “Different”  
In discussing cause and effect and the bearer of actions, two extreme views are also to be abandoned: one is the view that “the same self performs an action and experiences its result”; this is one extreme. The other is the view that “one self performs an action and a different self experiences its result”; this is the other extreme.  

Similarly, in speaking of the relationship between a life‑principle and the body, two extreme views are pointed out that should be avoided: one holds that the life‑principle and the body are identical; the other holds that the life‑principle and the body are fundamentally different. One should abandon such questions that assume that “phenomena” and “the owner of the phenomena” are different, and instead understand the arising of phenomena according to the law of dependent origination, recognizing that everything arises and ceases based on conditions and processes, without falling into the extremes of self‑doing, other‑doing, or the dichotomies of sameness and difference.

V.3 The Two Extremes of Sense Indulgence and Self‑Mortification  
Concerning modes of practice, two extremes are clearly pointed out that must be avoided. One is indulgence in sensory pleasures, taking delight in and clinging to sense objects; this is a low, vulgar, worldly way, unbecoming and unprofitable. The other is fixation on self‑mortification, taking one’s own torment as the central practice; this is painful, not followed by noble ones, bound up with what is meaningless and unprofitable. Both of these are extremes that should be abandoned.

In contrast, one should abandon these two extremes and practice according to the Middle Way. The Middle Way does not fall on either side; it nurtures the arising of vision, the arising of knowledge, calm, direct realization, complete awakening, and Nirvana. The concrete practice of this Middle Way is the Noble Eightfold Path; by relying on this Middle Way one can open wisdom, move toward peace, and accomplish right awakening and Nirvana.

VI. Understanding and Practicing the Law of Dependent Origination  

VI.1 The General Framework and Operation of the Law of Dependent Origination  
The general framework of the law of dependent origination points out that the arising and cessation of the world both operate according to a definite causal sequence. In the door of arising, following the principle that “When this exists, that comes to be; when this arises, that arises,” starting from ignorance there come, one after another, formations, consciousness, name‑and‑form, the six bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, aging‑and‑death—thus the whole aggregate of suffering is formed.  

In the door of cessation, following the principle that “When this does not exist, that does not come to be; when this ceases, that ceases,” starting from the elimination of ignorance, there is, step by step in reverse, the cessation of formations, consciousness, name‑and‑form, the six bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, existence, birth, and aging‑and‑death, finally arriving at the cessation of the entire aggregate of suffering.

On this basis it is pointed out that a correct, true‑to‑reality understanding of dependent origination and conditioned arising is the fundamental means for resolving doubts regarding the three times (past, present, and future). If one does not know the arising and cessation of dependent origination, one cannot truly be called a renunciant or a brahman, and cannot in this life personally realize and dwell in the true meaning. Only those who penetrate the arising and cessation of dependent origination truly deserve to be called renunciants or brahmans, able in this very life to personally realize and dwell in the true meaning.

VI.2 The Unified Core of Teaching, Practice, and Realization  
Across the three stages of the path of liberation—teaching the Dharma, practicing, and realizing liberation—there is one unifying principle: whether in teaching, in actual practice, or in realization, the sole guiding standard is leading toward disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to the twelve links of dependent origination.  

One who teaches the Dharma does so in order to lead others toward disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to these factors. One who practices, does so to move toward disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation regarding these factors. One who is liberated has already reached disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation regarding these factors, and because there is no more clinging, has realized Nirvana in this very life.

On a more concrete level of practice, the application of the law of dependent origination points out that the principle for the ending of suffering is: when ignorance is exhausted and craving is cut off, formations cease; when formations cease, consciousness ceases; and with the sequential cessation of all links, the whole aggregate of suffering is brought to an end. To recognize, for each link, its existence, the cause for its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation is an important part of knowing and implementing the path that ends suffering.

VI.3 Ignorance and True Knowing: The Practitioner’s Choice  
In the contrast between ignorance and true knowing, it is pointed out that those who are sunk in ignorance have consciousness that moves toward corresponding destinations based on wholesome, unwholesome, and imperturbable actions they have performed, thereby allowing such karmic fabrications to continue flowing on without end.  

But if a monk can abandon ignorance and give rise to true knowing, then once true knowing has arisen, he no longer constructs wholesome, unwholesome, or imperturbable formations that would create new conditions for consciousness to move toward. This abandoning of ignorance and arising of true knowing is a crucial key for penetrating dependent origination and walking the path to liberation.

Furthermore, if one cannot truly see, regarding each link of dependent origination, these four aspects—namely the link itself, the cause of its arising, its cessation, and the path that leads to its cessation—then one must seek correct guidance and methods of practice, so as not to remain stuck in ignorance.

VII. Liberation‑Knowledge and Complete Awakening  

VII.1 The Attainment of Wisdom and Key Points of Contemplation  
In the accomplishment of complete awakening, the content of wisdom‑attainment includes three levels: truly knowing dependent origination, truly knowing the arising and ceasing of dependent origination, and truly knowing the path that leads toward the complete cessation of dependent origination.  

At the same time, there is a set of crucial dharma‑character contemplations: contemplation of the knowledge of the fixed nature of phenomena; contemplation of the knowledge of the ending of phenomena; contemplation of the knowledge of the decay and corruption of phenomena; contemplation of the knowledge of the abandoning of craving; contemplation of the knowledge of cessation. Through such contemplation, one can truly understand the arising and cessation of the world and fulfill right view.

In this process, the causal principle that “when consciousness does not abide, suffering ends” is also emphasized: when consciousness no longer abides anywhere at all, there is no future rebirth; without rebirth, birth, aging‑and‑death are extinguished, and at the same time sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and distress all cease. This is regarded as the complete ending of the entire aggregate of suffering.

VII.2 Middle‑Way Liberation and the Fulfillment of Right Understanding  
The Middle Way taught by the Tathāgata does not cling to any extreme view—be it the previously mentioned extremes of self‑doing and other‑doing, sameness and difference, or the extremes of existence and non‑existence. The Tathāgata does not adhere to any of these extreme views; rather, he proclaims the teaching based on the Middle Way that does not fall into either side.  

Relying on the Middle Way, the Tathāgata explains the truth thus: dependent on conditions there is aging‑and‑death; dependent on ignorance there are formations. Leaving these two extremes aside, and teaching in accordance with the Middle‑Way principle of dependent origination, one can clearly see the arising and the cessation of the world.

A practitioner who penetrates dependent origination and conditioned arising and, relying on the Middle Way, truly observes the arising and cessation of the world, will not give rise to such wrong views as existence‑view and non‑existence‑view, and will not be confused by scattered, deviant, twisted, and shifting doctrines. When ignorance is completely extinguished, all wrong views are cut off at the root—like a palmyra tree whose crown and pith have been severed and which will never grow again in the future. At that point all confusion, deviant doctrines, distortions, and mental agitation are abandoned, and the practitioner can personally realize and dwell in the true meaning in this very life.

VII.3 The Process of Liberation and the Knowledge “I Am Liberated”  
In the final stage of the path of liberation, the process of liberation can be summarized in three steps: because of disenchantment there is distancing from craving; because of distancing from craving there is liberation of the mind; because of liberation, the wisdom “I am liberated” arises.  

This wisdom is not a clinging to a fixed, unchanging self; rather, it is a true knowing of all conditional arising and ceasing, and of the cessation of the aggregate of suffering: knowing that suffering has been ended, the task has been accomplished, what had to be done has been done, and there will be no further becoming.

At the same time, in summarizing the path, two opposite ways are also pointed out: the path that accords with the accumulation of embodied existence is a path of wrong understanding, leading to bondage of life and the arising of suffering; the path that accords with the ending of embodied existence is a path of right understanding, leading to the ending of bondage and suffering. If a practitioner can follow the Middle Way, penetrate dependent origination and its cessation, and abandon ignorance and craving, he can walk the path that accords with the ending of embodied existence and fully accomplish liberation.

VII.4 The Root of Suffering and the Practitioner of the True Dharma  
In summarizing suffering and liberation, it is emphasized that one must know suffering, know the arising of suffering, know the cessation of suffering, and know the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. Only by practicing in this way is one a practitioner in accord with the true Dharma, truly walking the path that ends suffering.  

When the law of dependent origination is understood completely in both its forward and reverse aspects—knowing both the accumulation of the aggregate of suffering and its cessation—and when, in practice, one fully carries out disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to the twelve links of dependent origination, then the practitioner can, in this very life, realize liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, truly dwelling in the Nirvana of non‑clinging.
