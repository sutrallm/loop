<title> Awakening, Moral Discipline, and the Path of Purification </title>
<article>
I. Awakening and the Taming of the Mind

I.1 The Fundamental Attitude of Awakening and Purity  
When others are absorbed in the five kinds of defilements and the five kinds of wholesome qualities, as if asleep within them and unaware, a genuine practitioner should remain awake and mindful, not simply drifting along with the current. The mind’s defilement and its purity each have their corresponding five causes and five methods. Because these causes and conditions differ, the contrasting states of impurity and purity arise. Thus, practice begins with vigilance and discernment regarding these causes and conditions, so that one does not sink into the slumber of ignorance.

I.2 Taming the Mind and Vigorous Effort  
The taming of the mind must begin with the removal of arrogance, so that the heart inclines toward stillness and stability. Only by using wisdom to undo various bonds can one loosen the fetters of defilement. A practitioner should delight in solitude, be unheedless neither in body nor mind, and not run after external objects. In solitude, one guards body and mind, and through unfailing, vigorous effort, strives to cross the stream of birth and death, moving toward the far shore beyond death and completing the crossing from this shore to the other.

II. Moral Shame and Inner Purification

II.1 The Purifying Power of Moral Shame and Mindfulness  
A sense of shame and moral dread (hiri and ottappa) is a powerful inner force. With such a heart, one can stop unwholesome actions before they arise, or, if they have already arisen, turn back in time from the edge of the cliff. Even if the mindfulness one cultivates is only slight, as long as it is continuous and sustained over a long period, it is enough to lead the practitioner to touch the edge of suffering and gradually move away from its causes. In the face of all forms of inequality and discrimination in the world, a practitioner should regard and treat others with an equal mind, not giving rise to bias or anger because of different external circumstances, and thereby maintain inner stability and clarity.

II.2 Inner Purification and the Clearing of Mental Obstructions  
Practice emphasizes purification from the inside out. One must purify what is originally impure in one’s nature and the various defilements in the mind in order truly to enter the path of liberation. Such purification is not merely a change in outward form, but an actual clearing away of all obstacles in the mind, so that the inner blockages that hinder wholesome qualities from arising can dissolve. As the accumulated inner obstructions are gradually cleared away, the pure nature of the mind naturally reveals itself.

II.3 Recognizing Internal Corruption  
Among the eight kinds of obstacles, internal corruption is a particularly hidden one. It refers to a person whose behavior is evil and impure, yet who outwardly disguises themself as pure, presenting an upright image while the heart is filled with filth and defilements. This discrepancy between appearance and reality is a deep-level pollution. It obstructs one’s own liberation and misleads others, so in practice one must be deeply vigilant about it and avoid drifting into internal corruption without realizing it.

III. The Virtues of the Saṅgha and Guarding the Sense Doors

III.1 The Irreproachable Image of the Saṅgha  
The Saṅgha is regarded as an irreproachable and pure assembly. Monks and other renunciants have minds that are calm, upright, and straight, with impartial attitudes and conduct. This pure collective image arises from each member’s own taming of the mind and restraint of outward behavior. The noble ones skillfully guard their sense faculties, just as a skilled charioteer firmly controls the reins in hand, remaining heedful at every moment and not allowing the six sense faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind to run wild. In this way they prevent defilements from entering within through the senses.

III.2 Precepts Like Fire and the Importance of Seemingly Minor Rules  
The power of the moral conduct of a monk who keeps precepts is likened to fire, which can burn away defilements and unwholesome karma. If someone looks down on a monk who keeps the precepts, the consequence is likened to a forest burned to ashes by a raging fire, after which grasses and trees can hardly flourish again; or to cutting off a plant’s new shoot, destroying its possibility of continuing life. These similes show that looking down on pure moral conduct not only harms others, but also cuts off one’s own opportunity for the growth of wholesome roots. Therefore one should not give rise to contempt toward either the precepts or those who keep them.

IV. Precepts as the Raft of Purity and Liberation

IV.1 The True Path of Purification  
True purity does not come merely from outer cleanliness or formal piety, but from the keeping of precepts. Precepts are regarded as a raft for crossing the sea of birth and death, able to guide beings from the near shore of the sea of suffering to the far shore of liberation. Through keeping precepts, body and mind can both become pure, no longer covered by filth. For one whose moral conduct is perfected, both body and mind are far removed from defilement, thereby establishing a firm foundation for liberation.

IV.2 The Excellent Benefits of Keeping Precepts and Liberation  
Those who keep precepts are often praised by good and virtuous people, because their outward conduct is upright and their inner thoughts incline toward purity. The noble ones rely on moral discipline in order to further purify their bodies and minds, and on this basis carry out deeper practice. By practicing in accordance with the precepts and taking them as one’s support, a practitioner can gradually cross over to the far shore and finally attain true liberation. This is the excellent benefit brought by moral discipline.

V. The Specific Content of the Precepts and Methods of Keeping Them

V.1 Fundamental Precepts and the Purity of the Seven Bodily and Verbal Actions  
In the fundamental precepts, the first emphasis is on not killing, staying far away from any act that harms life. Next is not stealing, not taking anything that has not been permitted or given by others. Then comes refraining from sexual misconduct, maintaining purity and propriety in relations between men and women, and not damaging the bodies, minds, or families of others or oneself. Next is not speaking falsehood: speech must be true and not deceptive, not using lies to mislead others. Finally, one refrains from drinking alcohol and from contact with substances that befog the mind, so as to avoid triggering other faults through mental confusion.

In basic training, further to renouncing killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and false speech, one also abandons divisive speech, harsh speech, and frivolous chatter. Divisive speech is speech that sows discord and destroys harmony; harsh speech is coarse, injurious words; frivolous chatter is unbeneficial, flowery, and idle talk. Only by giving up these faults of verbal action can one’s speech become pure.

V.2 Purification of Thought and the Three Wholesome Courses of Action  
The practice of purifying thought requires abandoning greed, ill will, and wrong view, and actively cultivating non-greed, non-ill will, and right view. When the mind no longer clings intensely to objects, no longer harbors hatred toward beings, and one’s understanding of the world and of life shifts from wrong views to correct understanding, then the three karmic channels of body, speech, and mind truly incline toward purity. In the graduated path of practice, special emphasis is placed on the three wholesome courses of action: cutting off unwholesome actions of body, speech, and mind, and actively cultivating wholesome actions of body, speech, and mind. Through repeated cultivation, wide application, and continual strengthening of these three wholesome courses, one can fulfill the practice of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.

VI. Precepts as the Basis and the Foundation of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness

VI.1 Taking Precepts as the Basis of Practice  
In the complete sequence of practice, precepts are regarded as the basis on which practice stands. A practitioner should abide within the regulations of moral discipline and not abandon principle because of changes in environment. With precepts as the foundation, walking, standing, sitting, and lying down are all in accord with restraint. Such abiding enables the later cultivation of concentration and wisdom to have a firm support, and not be hollow or unstable.

VI.2 The Connection Between the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and Purity of Moral Discipline  
The cultivation of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness should be based on the keeping of precepts. One must first safeguard one’s actions and speech, and be alert even to the smallest faults, not treating any minor transgression lightly. While practicing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, purity of moral discipline is regarded as one of the important supporting conditions. It requires the practitioner to cut off unwholesome actions of body, speech, and mind, and at the same time to cultivate wholesome actions of body, speech, and mind. When conduct and thoughts both incline toward uprightness and purity, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness can unfold in a stable and profound way.

VII. Key Points of Keeping Precepts and Daily Safeguarding

VII.1 Constant Protection of Moral Conduct Day and Night  
Regarding the key points of keeping precepts, it is emphasized that one must constantly protect one’s moral conduct at all times, day and night, not allowing it to be damaged through a moment’s heedlessness. This protection is not only outer purity of behavior; more importantly, it means maintaining mindfulness in the heart at all times, continually observing one’s arising intentions and thoughts. With precepts as the basis, through daily and monthly accumulation of practice, body and mind can gradually be purified, turning from coarse unwholesome karma toward subtle and pure wholesome actions.

VII.2 Fulfilling the Four Foundations of Mindfulness Through the Three Wholesome Courses of Action  
Repeatedly cultivating and practicing the three wholesome courses of action not only forms good character, but is also said to complete the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. By continually cultivating wholesome bodily, verbal, and mental actions and by distancing and cutting off unwholesome actions in these three aspects, a practitioner can contemplate body, feelings, mind, and phenomena as they really are, thereby leading the practice of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness toward completeness and perfection.

VIII. Proper Repentance and Pure Discipline

VIII.1 The Premise and Proper Manner of Repentance  
In discussing the guidelines for repentance in accordance with the Dhamma, it is first emphasized that the premise of repentance is a clear recognition that one’s action is truly a fault. One must not justify oneself or cover it up. Only by sincerely acknowledging one’s mistakes does repentance have a foundation. As for the manner of repentance, it should be carried out in accordance with the true teaching, following the procedures and spirit laid down in the doctrine, and facing one’s faults with an attitude of respect and sincerity.

VIII.2 The Benefits of Proper Repentance and the Rebuilding of Discipline  
If one can repent in accordance with the true teaching, the monastic community will accept and receive the one who repents, affirming their intention to confess and taking them back into the community. In the discipline established by the noble ones, to see fault as fault, not to defend oneself, and to repent in accordance with the Dhamma causes one’s own wholesome qualities to grow. Because of sincere repentance and reform, in the future one can again enter a life of purer discipline and re-establish the foundation of purity in keeping precepts.

IX. The Etiquette of Alms-Rounds and a Right Livelihood

IX.1 The Timing and Bearing in Alms-Rounds  
In the regulations on alms-rounds, a monk should go on alms-round in the early morning, and should not approach villages or streets at inappropriate times, so as not to cause disturbance or misunderstanding among ordinary people. When going out for alms, he should wear the monastic robe properly and hold his alms bowl in hand, displaying dignified and upright deportment. When the circumstances are suitable, he may also teach the Dhamma to donors, repaying their generosity with the Dhamma so that both parties gain benefit.

IX.2 Ways of Avoiding Wrong Livelihood  
In the principles for right livelihood, it is first pointed out that one should avoid several forms of wrong livelihood, such as relying on various kinds of worldly knowledge for one’s living—like skills of interpreting signs, astrology, knowledge of animals, or divination—and also taking on errands or acting as a messenger for the sake of livelihood. These ways easily cause the mind to become scattered and are contrary to the purpose of renunciation, so they are listed as wrong livelihood to be abandoned.

IX.3 Concrete Practice of Right Livelihood  
In the concrete practice of right livelihood, it is also mentioned that one should not seek food in improper ways—for example, not begging for food with the mouth turned downward, upturned, or toward the four cardinal or four intermediate directions in an inappropriate attitude or posture. A practitioner should obtain and use food in accordance with the true teaching, accepting offerings with an upright and pure attitude, so that the source of one’s livelihood accords with the standards of right livelihood.

X. The Precepts Cherished by the Noble Ones, Stream-Entry, and Nibbāna

X.1 Common Features of the Precepts Cherished by the Noble Ones  
In various teachings—on four factors, the four factors leading to the attainment of stream-entry, the content of the four fulfilling factors, the four factors for the attainment of stream-entry, the elements of learning the true path, the four attainments that transcend the bad destinies, the content and meaning of the four factors of stream-entry, core principles, the four qualities tending toward Nibbāna, the concrete content of recollection, the four roots that moisten merit, the practice of pure discipline, and the concrete practice and specific features of purification—all consistently emphasize the importance of “the precepts cherished by the noble ones” or “spotless and pure moral conduct.”

Such moral conduct is the discipline loved, praised, and gladly upheld by the noble ones, and is also the pure moral conduct extolled by the wise and by good people. Its features include: the substance and practice of virtue are whole and complete, without breakage, neither broken nor torn, without leakage or blemish; its nature is single and unmixed, purely clean, not contaminated, without filth, stain, or impurity—spotlessly pure. Such moral discipline not only avoids all contamination and defilement, but is also liberative in character: it enables the mind to depart from bondage, to be freed from fetters and confinement. The very nature of these precepts is liberating and does not become an object of clinging.

X.2 Non-Clinging to the Form of Precepts and the Attainment of Samādhi  
The precepts cherished by the noble ones are repeatedly emphasized as “not clung to”—that is, one does not generate attachment or grasping toward the precepts themselves, does not cling to the external form of moral conduct, and does not turn observance of the precepts into a basis for conceit or rigidity. This non-clinging, pure moral discipline more effectively guides the mind toward liberation, helping it to withdraw from the various kinds of clinging in the world. Keeping such discipline can give rise to samādhi (concentrated collectedness of mind) and meditative absorption, and can lead to deeper levels of concentration, even to the wisdom that arises from deep concentration. These precepts not only lead to meditative calm and mental stability and focus, but are also said to lead to liberation, thereby fulfilling both concentration and wisdom.

X.3 Stream-Entry, Transcending the Bad Destinies, and the Moistening of Merit  
In the teachings on the four factors for the attainment of the fruit of stream-entry, the four factors leading to stream-entry, and the four factors of stream-entry, spotless moral discipline and the precepts cherished by the noble ones are both listed as indispensable conditions. This moral conduct is described as whole and complete, without breakage, gaps, mixture, or defilement, purely single and unmixed. It can guide the mind out of bondage, help it to become stable and concentrated, and yet one does not give rise to attachment or grasping toward it. It is also one of the four attainments that transcend the bad destinies—namely, the attainment of pure, undefiled moral discipline, precepts that are praised by the noble ones, without deficiency, stain, or impurity, not clung to, and able to lead to meditative absorption.

Furthermore, among the four qualities tending toward Nibbāna, spotless moral discipline is also listed as one. It emphasizes possessing the precepts cherished by the noble ones—precepts that are not broken, not torn, not mixed, not defiled, liberative in nature, praised by the wise, not clung to, and capable of thereby producing and leading to samādhi. In the four roots that moisten merit, the attainment of the precepts cherished by the noble ones is also proposed, again emphasizing precepts that are not broken, not torn, not mixed, not defiled, liberative, praised by the wise, not clung to, able to give rise to samādhi, and thus forming one of the basic conditions that nourish and moisten merit.

X.4 Pure Precepts and Their Non-Association with the Bad Destinies  
When speaking of the precepts cherished by the noble ones as a factor of stream-entry, it is explained that in practicing the discipline praised by the noble ones, such precepts possess the characteristics of not being broken, not torn, not mixed, not defiled, liberative, praised by the wise, not clung to, and able to lead to meditative absorption. It is further explained that even if the four great elements undergo change, the merit of keeping such precepts remains firm and unaltered, not shaken by the upheavals of the external world. One who has attained such moral discipline cannot be reborn in a bad destiny, because pure moral conduct has already removed the conditions for falling into states of misery. This clearly shows the crucial role of noble discipline in transcending the bad destinies.

X.5 The Concrete Practice of Purification and Guidance to Deep Concentration  
In the concrete practice of purification, the practice of keeping precepts is especially emphasized. It explains that upholding the discipline praised by the noble ones—precepts that are whole and complete, purely single, uncontaminated, and free from bondage, praised by the wise, not clinging to the external form of precepts—can give rise to meditative absorption and samādhi. In the section on the practice of pure discipline, it is likewise pointed out that keeping the discipline praised by the noble ones must possess many qualities: complete and intact, without breakage, purely single and unmixed, without defilement, leading to liberation, praised by the wise, not clinging to the world, and capable of giving rise to deep concentration. There is also teaching that the concrete manifestation of pure moral conduct is precisely the keeping of the flawless, meditation-leading discipline praised by the noble ones. And the attainment of the precepts cherished by the noble ones—not broken, not torn, not mixed, not defiled, liberative, praised by the wise, not clung to, able to produce samādhi—is one of the most fundamental among the four roots that moisten merit.

XI. Conclusion: Taking Precepts as the Boat and the Mind as the Shore  

Bringing together all of the above teachings: when others are asleep amid defilements and even wholesome qualities, a practitioner should remain awake, using a sense of shame and mindfulness as inner forces to purify what is impure in one’s nature and the defilements of the mind, to clear away mental obstacles, and to be alert to the danger of internal corruption. The Saṅgha, as an irreproachable assembly, is founded on the keeping of precepts and the guarding of the sense doors. Monks, by going on alms-round in the early morning, avoiding wrong livelihood, and receiving and using food in accordance with the true teaching, maintain a life of right livelihood. The basis of practice lies in abandoning killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and frivolous chatter, and in abandoning greed, ill will, and wrong view, while cultivating non-greed, non-ill will, and right view. In this way the three wholesome courses of action fulfill the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, and one abides in practice with moral discipline as one’s footing. When behavior deviates, if one can honestly acknowledge the fault in accordance with the true teaching and repent properly, one can again enter a life of pure discipline.

On a deeper level, true purity comes from keeping precepts. Moral discipline is the raft for crossing the sea of birth and death; keeping precepts purifies both body and mind, leaving no defilement. Those who keep precepts are praised by the good and by the wise, and the noble ones also rely on them to purify body and mind, practicing in dependence on the precepts to reach the far shore and accomplish liberation. Ultimately, by taking as the core those pure precepts cherished by the noble ones—which are not broken, not torn, not mixed, not defiled, without leakage, without blemish, purely single, uncontaminated, liberative, not clung to, and able to give rise to samādhi and meditative absorption—one can stay far from the bad destinies, move toward stream-entry and Nibbāna, accomplish the moistening of merit, and complete the path of awakening and purification.
