<title>The Nature of Suffering and the Way to Thoroughly Know It</title>
<article>
I. The Real Existence of Suffering and Its Correct Cognition

The starting point of all practice and contemplation lies in acknowledging the real existence of suffering, and affirming that suffering can be correctly known. Suffering is not a fabricated concept, but an actually existing condition and state. A person can, by means of right view, face, understand, and clearly see this reality. When a person possesses correct understanding, they are able to recognize suffering as it truly is, no longer viewing it in an inverted or mistaken way. This is precisely the core emphasized by the right understanding and cognition of suffering.

II. The Definition of Suffering and the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging

II.1 Suffering within the Framework of the Four Noble Truths

Within the overall framework of the Four Noble Truths, suffering is clearly defined as an object that must be directly and accurately known. Starting from suffering itself, one can then further reach the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to that cessation. Therefore, what must first be clarified is: what exactly is suffering?

Within this framework, suffering is defined as the five aggregates subject to clinging. That is to say, suffering is not merely the surface experience of painful feeling, but is the very aggregate-configuration constituted by the five grasped-at aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. So long as there is clinging to these five aggregates, this entire aggregate-combination of the five aggregates subject to clinging is suffering. Form is material shape and body, feeling is sensation, perception is images and imaginings, formations are various activities and constructions, and consciousness is discernment and knowing. When these five are clung to and tightly grasped, the whole that they constitute is called suffering.

II.2 Knowing the Arising, Cessation, and Path in Relation to the Five Aggregates

Cognition of the five aggregates does not stop at understanding that they are suffering; it must further encompass three dimensions. First, one must discern the origin of the five aggregates, that is, understand where the five aggregates come from, and understand the causes and conditions by which the five aggregates become suffering—this is what is called “origin” (arising). Second, one must discern the cessation of the five aggregates—understand that the five aggregates, as an aggregate-configuration of suffering, can come to cessation; suffering is not something that must necessarily exist forever—this is “cessation.” Furthermore, one must discern the path that leads to the cessation of the five aggregates, that is, the actual route that leads toward the state of cessation; this path is called the path in conformity with cessation. Only when a person can simultaneously know as they truly are the origin of the five aggregates, the cessation of the five aggregates, and the path leading to that cessation, does their understanding of suffering approach completeness.

III. The Five Aggregates as Suffering and as Phenomena of Suffering

III.1 The Suffering Characteristic of the Five Aggregates

Viewed in themselves, each of the five aggregates bears the characteristic of suffering. Form is suffering and is a phenomenon of suffering; feeling is suffering and is a phenomenon of suffering; perception is suffering and is a phenomenon of suffering; formations are suffering and are phenomena of suffering; consciousness is suffering and is a phenomenon of suffering. Here it is not merely being said that they bring about suffering, but rather that they themselves are suffering and belong to the category of phenomena of suffering. That is, form is not a neutral existence, but has the nature of suffering; so too with feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. From this perspective, not only is the totality of the five aggregates, as the five aggregates subject to clinging, suffering, but each individual part—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—fundamentally possesses the characteristic of suffering and of being a phenomenon of suffering.

III.2 Suffering as the Key Point for Contemplation and Letting Go

When contemplating all phenomena, suffering is a fundamental attribute that cannot be overlooked. In contemplation, any phenomenon that belongs to the domain of impermanent phenomena has suffering as its very nature. Whatever is impermanent carries the qualities of instability, unreliability, and change; therefore, its nature is suffering. Such contemplation prevents one from mistakenly regarding impermanent phenomena as reliable places of safety and repose.

At the same time, when observing and relinquishing clinging to all phenomena, suffering is likewise an indispensable focal point. In such observation, one sees that all impermanent phenomena, without exception, are suffering. The statement that “all impermanent phenomena are suffering” emphasizes that whatever is impermanent inevitably possesses the nature of suffering. From contemplating the fundamental attribute of impermanent phenomena, to clearly recognizing in the act of letting go that all impermanent phenomena are suffering, these two angles repeatedly highlight the same point: impermanence and suffering are inseparably linked. Directly understanding this link is the key to loosening clinging.

IV. The Six Sense Bases and the Thorough Observation of Suffering

IV.1 The Suffering Characteristic of the Six Internal Sense Bases

In observing the six internal sense bases, one must recognize that the internal sense faculties themselves have the nature of suffering. The eye is suffering; the ear is suffering; the nose is suffering; the tongue is suffering; the body is suffering; the mind is suffering. That is, the six internal bases of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, bodily touch, and mental activity are not pure realms free from suffering, but carry the nature of suffering. Understanding that the eye is suffering, one no longer clings to the eye faculty as lovable or reliable; understanding that the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are all suffering, one no longer regards these sense bases as truly stable supports. This principle of observing the six internal bases enables one to see the presence of suffering beginning from the most intimate level of one’s own sense faculties.

IV.2 The Suffering Characteristic of the Six External Sense Bases

Corresponding to the six internal sense bases are the six external sense bases, which must likewise be observed in light of the characteristic of suffering. Forms are suffering; sounds are suffering; odors are suffering; tastes are suffering; tangibles are suffering; mental objects (dharmas) are suffering. That is, all visible forms, all audible sounds, all smells, all flavors, all tactile objects contacted by the body, and all mental objects and phenomena taken as the mind’s object, all possess the nature of suffering. Though forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects appear diverse and rich, they are all in a state of impermanent change, and thus are to be understood as suffering.

When both the six internal and six external sense bases are rightly observed as suffering, one no longer seeks true safety and fulfillment in the relationships between eye and forms, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and tangibles, mind and mental objects. Through such a method of observation, one’s understanding of suffering expands to encompass all the sense bases and their corresponding objects, forming a comprehensive grasp.

V. The Core Aim of the Holy Life: Thoroughly Knowing the Nature of Suffering

From the real existence of suffering, to “suffering is the five aggregates subject to clinging,” to the fact that each of the five aggregates is itself suffering and a phenomenon of suffering, then further to observing that whatever belongs to impermanent phenomena has suffering as its nature, and that all impermanent phenomena are suffering—this entire body of understanding is not mere theory, but the core orientation of the holy life (brahmacharya). The fundamental purpose of practicing the holy life is precisely to fully know the nature of suffering.

Practice is not merely about temporarily escaping from suffering, but about, through right view and contemplation, thoroughly knowing what suffering is, how suffering exists within the five aggregates, how suffering pervades the six internal and six external sense bases, and how suffering is intimately connected with all impermanent phenomena. When a person follows knowledge of the origin of the five aggregates, understands the possibility of the cessation of the five aggregates, and clearly recognizes the path that leads to that cessation—the path in conformity with cessation—they are then enacting the true core of the holy life.

Thus, the ultimate aim of the holy life is, through comprehensive and profound contemplation, to completely know the nature of suffering. Only on the basis of such thorough understanding can one’s attitude toward suffering genuinely change; only then can clinging to the five aggregates, the six sense bases, and all impermanent phenomena begin to relax, thereby opening the way to the cessation of suffering. Starting from right view and running through a comprehensive observation of suffering, the five aggregates, impermanence, and the six sense bases, everything finally converges on a single direction: thorough knowledge of suffering is the fundamental purpose of the entire holy life.
