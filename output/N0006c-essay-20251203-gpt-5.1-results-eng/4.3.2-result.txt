I. Returning Harsh Words and Refusing to Associate

I.1 The Metaphor of Abusive Words as Food and the Principle of Returning Them  
When others address you with abusive words, you can regard those words as a plate of food they are handing to you. If you choose not to accept it, the words are like an unclaimed offering: they naturally still belong to the original giver and do not leave an actual burden or defilement in your own mind. In other words, by not accepting another’s harsh speech, you in effect return it intact to the speaker, so that all malice stops on their side and does not take root and grow on your side.

I.2 The Relationship between Not Receiving Abusive Words and Not Associating  
When a person firmly refuses to accept abusive words, in reality they are also choosing not to associate with the speaker on the level of malice. This “non‑association” is not necessarily a breaking of outer relationships, but a refusal to resonate inwardly with the other’s ill will. In this way, everything the other person says in anger belongs solely to them from beginning to end, and does not, through your acceptance, become part of your own mental activity. By not receiving, you do not share; thus the karmic results of the abusive speech remain entirely with the speaker and do not implicate you.

II. The Qualities of the Unangry Person and the Twofold Victory

II.1 The Inner Character of Freedom from Anger and Liberation  
A truly unangry person is not someone who never encounters provocation, but someone who, in any circumstance, does not respond with anger. They are skilled in taming themselves, able in various situations to restrain and correct their bodily and mental actions, not being dragged about by momentary emotions. Equipped with proper wisdom and able to see things as they really are, they are able to proceed toward liberation, no longer bound by afflictions and anger. Such a person’s mind is naturally tranquil and stable—neither agitated nor rough—clear like still water.

II.2 The Twofold Victory Gained by Not Returning Anger with Anger  
When facing an attack from someone burning with rage, if one does not respond with anger—clearly knowing the other is enraged yet still maintaining right mindfulness and letting the mind abide in stillness—this conduct yields a twofold victory. First, victory over oneself: not allowing oneself to be drawn into the prison of anger, thus preserving clarity and ease. Second, victory with respect to the other: not intensifying their anger, not fanning the flames and worsening the conflict, but by refusing retaliation, leaving open the possibility for their anger to subside. In such interactions where anger is not repaid with anger, both sides can ultimately gain benefit, being freed from the chains of anger.

II.3 The Twofold Benefit for Self and Others Brought by Calm and Mindfulness  
When a person can quiet themselves and guard their mind—facing situations with right mindfulness, watching over their arising thoughts and not letting afflictions drive them—they can benefit both self and others. For themselves, such mindfulness and stillness keep the heart from being swallowed by harmful emotions; for others, they are no longer subjected to secondary injury from one’s counterattack. By contrast, those who have no understanding of the true teaching are truly foolish, for they fail to recognize the profound benefit of using calm and mindfulness to accomplish benefit for both self and others; they only know how to dance with anger, causing harm to themselves and to others alike.

III. The Core Spirit of Forbearance and Its Twofold Benefit

III.1 Silent Endurance as the Real Victory  
When verbal attacks become extremely fierce, stabbing into the heart like blades, if one can still maintain silence and patience, without rushing to retaliate with equally sharp words, that restraint is what truly constitutes victory. Responding to anger with anger only adds fuel to the fire and makes the situation worse. By contrast, those who remain quietly patient in the midst of intense conflict are not retreating; rather, they are refusing, in the face of the sharpest provocations, to let anger dictate their words and deeds. This is a deep and hard‑to‑shake form of victory.

III.2 The Two Kinds of Victory Brought by Forbearance  
Refraining from angry retaliation in conflict brings two kinds of benefit. For oneself, one avoids further afflictions, mistakes, and regrets that anger would bring, thereby protecting the purity and peace of one’s mind. For others, one does not further inflame their already heightened emotions; instead, in the absence of counter‑attack, their anger may gradually cool. Taking care of both one’s own benefit and that of others in this way is the twofold victory accomplished through forbearance.

IV. Our Attitude toward Those Worthy of Respect and Subduing Inner Displeasure

IV.1 Attitudes to Abandon When Facing Those Worthy of Respect  
When dealing with those who deserve respect and veneration, if the heart still harbors arrogance and pride, it is hard to truly receive benefit from them. Any attitude of self‑importance and contempt toward those worthy of respect should be thoroughly abandoned. Only by letting go of arrogance and pride can we, with a humble mind, accept their instruction and thus elevate our practice and virtue.

IV.2 Eliminating Displeasure by Oneself and Abiding in the Dharma  
The key to taming the mind lies in being able to extinguish inner displeasure by oneself, rather than allowing it to grow into resentment or anger. When unpleasant feelings arise, one should use wisdom and right mindfulness to transform them into pleasantness, letting the mind shift from knotting up to relaxing. This transformation does not rely on external conditions, but on firmly abiding in the true teaching (Dharma). As long as one has confidence in the Dharma and steadily relies on its principles, one will not be easily shaken by external change. Whether encountering favorable or adverse conditions, one can face them with a mind that abides in the Dharma, keeping the heart stable and joyful.

V. Comprehensive Practice of the Principles of Victorious Forbearance

V.1 The Core Principle of Remaining Silent While Clearly Knowing the Other Is Angry  
The core of the principles of victorious forbearance is that, even while clearly knowing that the other person is angry, one is still able to maintain clear right mindfulness and keep the mind in a state of stillness, not being carried away by the other’s emotions. At the same time, if one is in a stronger, more capable position yet can bear the offenses and rudeness of those who are weaker, such forbearance is especially remarkable. A strong person is not unable to fight back, but consciously chooses endurance instead of revenge; such restraint is far more precious than the forced forbearance of those who have no power to respond.

V.2 Not Returning Anger with Anger, Not Competing, and Not Imposing Heavy Punishments  
In concrete practice, when facing another’s anger, one should not respond with anger, or else the conflict will only escalate step by step. When dealing with the foolish, one should also avoid entering into contests and rivalries, for contention only traps both sides in endless opposition, benefiting neither reason nor mind. When encountering foolish or wrongful actions, one should not at once resort to severe punishment to stop them; otherwise, deep resentment and resistance can easily arise. Instead, one should take forbearance and gentleness as the primary means of response, ensuring that restraint and guidance are grounded in lenience rather than heavy retribution.

V.3 Explanation of Principles of Universal Application  
This core principle—“clearly knowing the other is angry, yet maintaining right mindfulness and stillness”—can be widely applied in all situations involving conflict and provocation. When others are angry or when fools provoke us, as long as we implement forbearance and gentleness through concrete actions such as not answering anger with anger, not competing, and not hastily resorting to heavy punishment, we are thoroughly applying this core principle on all levels. In this way, we not only prevent conflict from expanding, but through our own stability and tolerance, we achieve true victory and benefit, allowing both ourselves and others to gain some measure of freedom and improvement in the process.

VI. The Wisdom, Value, and Supreme Benefit of Forbearance

VI.1 Forbearance Is Not Fear or Weakness  
When facing the conduct of fools or the various actions others take under the sway of anger, we should respond with forbearance and inner stillness, clearly understanding that the other is presently consumed by anger. This practice of forbearance does not arise from timidity, fear of being hurt, or a weak character that dares not respond; rather, it is a conscious effort to avoid inflaming the conflict. Restraining retaliation through stillness is based on insight into the overall situation and consideration of the consequences; it is a wise choice.

VI.2 Among All Victors, the One Who Wins through Forbearance Is Supreme  
Among all those who seek personal benefit and strive for victory, the one who prevails through forbearance is the most excellent victor. Especially when a powerful person faces the offense of someone powerless and chooses to endure rather than oppress, they demonstrate the most outstanding kind of forbearance. Such forbearance is not submission to the other person; it is the overcoming of one’s own impulse to subdue others, and thus it has especially high value.

VI.3 The Greatest Victory of Forbearance amid Intense Conflict  
In battles or intense confrontations, if one can respond with forbearance and not choose to retaliate against the other’s anger, it becomes possible to win the greatest victory. When anger is not met with anger, the dispute between the two sides has the chance to gradually subside. Such conduct is like that of a doctor healing both bodily and mental illnesses: one is not only treating oneself, but also helping the other to ease the disease of anger. Through forbearance, conflict is no longer reinforced but is slowly dissolved.

VI.4 Forbearance Surpasses Other Methods of Seeking Benefit  
Among all methods used to pursue benefit and achievement, none is more excellent than forbearance. Diligent effort and the pursuit of various satisfactions and accomplishments can certainly yield some benefits, but compared with what forbearance can accomplish, they are still inferior. The benefits brought by forbearance are the most sublime, surpassing all other methods. Forbearance not only prevents harm; it can also resolve opposition and, in the long run, accumulate deep wholesome results for both oneself and others.

VII. The Practice of Forgiveness, Patience, and Restraining Anger

VII.1 Remaining Long without Anger and Frequently Forgiving  
In everyday interactions, one should train the mind not to be easily angered, not to flare up immediately when provoked, and even to remain without anger for long periods. This is not repression, but regulation of one’s emotions. At the same time, one should cultivate the habit of frequently forgiving others—being generous toward their mistakes, oversights, and offenses, not rushing to calculate and blame. In this way, anger finds it difficult to accumulate in the mind and turn into a long‑term affliction.

VII.2 Restraining Oneself out of Concern for One’s Own Benefit  
When facing situations that might trigger anger, one should reflect on one’s long‑term benefit and examine what harm anger actually brings to oneself. Realizing that anger only damages one’s own merit and peace, one can, out of concern for one’s own welfare, restrain oneself and not let momentary rage control one’s conduct and speech. This restraint is not a forced suppression, but a choice based on clear judgment—a decision not to be driven by anger in order to safeguard one’s true interests.

VIII. Receiving Admonition and the Key to Non‑Regression

VIII.1 Differences in Types of Conduct  
In human interaction and the course of practice, patterns of behavior can broadly be divided into a few types. One type is inwardly free from anger and hatred while also willing to accept admonition. Another type is full of anger and resentment and refuses to accept any admonition. These differences in conduct and attitude lead to completely different outcomes.

VIII.2 The Inevitable Correspondence between Conduct and Result  
If a person is free from anger and hatred and gladly accepts others’ loyal advice and guidance, then on the path of practice and in life, they will inevitably not regress; they will continue moving forward and steadily progress. Conversely, if a person’s mind is filled with anger and hatred and they stubbornly refuse to accept admonition, they will inevitably regress on the path and stray far from the way they ought to follow. This regression is not accidental; it is the inescapable result of their conduct and mindset.

IX. The Forbearance Tests of Practitioners and the Conditions for Suitability for Ordination

IX.1 Attitude toward Mockery and Slander  
For those who aspire to practice the path, the mockery and slander of the outside world are tests. When others heap sarcasm, contempt, or malicious words upon you, you should not give rise to the feeling that you “cannot bear it.” If, at the first sign of verbal attack, you feel unable to endure and your heart is immediately stirred up and wounded, that shows that your cultivation of forbearance is not yet mature.

IX.2 Criteria for Suitability for Monastic Practice  
The ability to endure others’ words is one of the important criteria for judging whether someone is suitable to leave home and undertake monastic practice. If, in the face of mockery and slander, one can still endure and not respond with anger, keeping one’s mind stable, such a person is a worthy child of good family, suitable for monastic life. On the other hand, if one cannot bear even slight dissatisfaction in others’ words and easily gives rise to hatred and resentment, then one is not suited to monastic practice. The monastic life will inevitably involve various misunderstandings and slanders; without forbearance, one cannot persist long on the path.

X. The Skill of Subduing the Mind and Defeating the Inner and Outer Hosts of Mara

X.1 Relying on the Essential Teachings of the Noble Ones to Soften and Harmonize the Mind  
To make the mind gentle and well‑disciplined, free from coarseness and agitation, one must rely on the essential teachings spoken by the noble ones as the basis for practice. By listening to and putting these teachings into practice, one gradually tames the mind out of scatteredness and rigidity, making it both soft and strong—not dragged about by emotions, yet clearly able to discern good from evil and right from wrong.

X.2 Using the Dharma to Overcome the Invasions of the Host of Mara  
As the mind gradually becomes well‑disciplined and steadily abides in the true Dharma, one can use the Dharma as a weapon to counter all inner and outer invasions like the hosts of Mara. These “hosts of Mara” include inner greed, anger, displeasure, and all manner of afflictions, as well as outer provocations and disturbances. By relying on and practicing the Dharma, one is not overthrown when facing such invasions but instead defeats them with firmness and clarity, allowing practice to proceed steadily and no longer be ruled by anger and afflictions.
