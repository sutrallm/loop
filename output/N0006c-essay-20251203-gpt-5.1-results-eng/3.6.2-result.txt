I. The Practice of Signless Samādhi and Its Meritorious Results  

As a core method of cultivation, signless samādhi is in itself extremely sublime. If a practitioner can earnestly cultivate this samādhi, they are nurturing an exceptionally excellent meditative state. When such practice is not just occasional, but is carried out repeatedly, many times, and continuously, it gradually accumulates profound merit.

By frequently cultivating signless samādhi, one can obtain numerous results and merits. These results and merits are naturally accomplished over a long period of practice, through continually abiding in signless meditative concentration. Because this samādhi is itself exceedingly wonderful, the corresponding results and merits are likewise especially superior and vast, exerting a far-reaching influence on the practitioner in both this present life and future lives.

II. The Worldly Blessings Brought About by the Fulfillment of the Four Dharmas  

When a noble disciple fulfills a specific set of four dharmas, they thereby obtain various kinds of worldly blessings. After these four dharmas are fulfilled, first, in terms of lifespan, one can obtain a lifespan in accord with that of the heavenly realms and the human realm. That is to say, the length of this lifespan corresponds to the blessings of the heavens and of the human world, embodying the enhancement of lifespan brought about by the fulfillment of the four dharmas.

Next, in terms of appearance, a noble disciple who fulfills these four dharmas can obtain physical appearance corresponding to that of the heavens and the human realm. This dignified and upright appearance accords with that of celestial beings and blessed humans, and is a worldly wholesome result that naturally follows upon the fulfillment of the four dharmas.

Furthermore, in terms of happiness and ease, because the noble disciple has fulfilled these four dharmas, they can obtain happiness corresponding to that of the heavens and the human realm. This happiness is manifested not only in bodily and mental comfort and stability, but also in pleasant experiences that correspond to the blessings of the heavenly and human realms; it is a kind of happiness brought about by the power of merit.

In addition, in terms of reputation, one who fulfills these four dharmas can also obtain a reputation corresponding to that of the heavens and the human realm. This good name, in harmony with the wholesome renown of gods and humans, is a pure reputation naturally accomplished through the practice of these four dharmas.

Finally, in terms of authority and power, a noble disciple likewise, by fulfilling these four dharmas, can obtain authority and power corresponding to that of the heavenly and human realms. This authority and power are manifested in possessing the appropriate influence and leadership within both the heavens and among humans, and constitute a kind of worldly accomplishment brought about by the fulfillment of the four dharmas.

From this we can see that, whether it is the cultivation of the extremely sublime signless samādhi—through frequent practice bringing about many results and merits—or the fulfillment of the four dharmas, thereby obtaining lifespan, appearance, happiness, reputation, and authority and power that correspond to the blessings of the heavens and the human realm, the worldly blessings and merits brought about by these practices and attainments are indeed extraordinarily excellent and complete manifestations.</article>
