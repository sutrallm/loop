<title> Fundamental Principles of Virtuous Conduct and the Path of Non-Harming </title>
<article>
I. Fundamental Principles in Dealing with Life  
I.1 Self-Restraint and Non-Harming of Sentient Beings  
Among all the fundamental bases of virtuous conduct, the first issue to face is one’s attitude toward life. With regard to all living beings, one should constantly restrain and govern oneself, not allowing body and mind to act at will, and not letting the defilements of greed, hatred, and delusion drive one into actions that harm life. Confronted with any sentient being, one should not inflict injury or damage. This principle of non-harming is the most basic form of respect and rule regarding life, and it is also the starting point on which all virtuous conduct is established.

II. Those Who Bear Insult and Heal Both Sides  
II.1 Practitioners Who Can Heal Themselves and Others  
In the practice of non-harming and virtuous conduct, those who possess the spirit of patience in the face of insult are often regarded as healers of both sides. Such practitioners can heal the afflictions in their own hearts, not being drawn along by resentment, anger, or various adverse circumstances, thereby calming the pain and unease within themselves. At the same time, through their words, actions, and attitudes, they help others lessen their afflictions, exerting a soothing and healing influence on others’ hearts. Because their conduct not only benefits themselves—cooling their own minds—but also benefits others, enabling them to leave suffering and gain peace, we may say that all their actions are in fact healing deeds that bring real benefit to both self and others.

III. Purity Free of Stain and the Law of Malice Returning  
III.1 The Stainless Are Not Defiled; Malice Ultimately Returns to the Fool  
Within the workings of karmic cause and effect, there is a law concerning purity and malice that is worth deep reflection. When a person is intrinsically pure and stainless, with thoughts and conduct unpolluted by greed, hatred, and delusion, then the filth and malice directed at them by others will in fact be hard to make truly effective. For one who is without stain, external malice and slander cannot genuinely defile their pure nature, because inwardly they do not resonate with those unwholesome deeds, nor do they repay resentment with resentment.

However, malice does not thereby vanish without trace. The malicious intent and harmful will that were originally meant to be imposed on others ultimately return to the foolish person who gave rise to them. This situation is like scattering dust against the wind: the dust does not successfully fall upon others, but is blown straight back, settling on the one who threw it. The direction taken by evil thoughts and deeds is the same: though their original purpose is to harm others, they end up harming the originator. This is the working principle of malice and the inevitable result manifested by the law of purity free from stain.

IV. The True Meaning of Non-Harming  
IV.1 The Difference Between Name and Reality  
When speaking of “non-harming,” one cannot remain only at the level of labels and titles. The true meaning of non-harming is far more than a name that is merely spoken or written. If one possesses only the label of “non-harming” yet in daily conduct still causes injury to others, this is contrary to the genuine path of non-harming.

IV.2 Comprehensive Practice in Body, Speech, and Mind  
Genuine non-harming must be expressed through complete practice in three areas: actions, speech, and thoughts. In bodily conduct, one does not in any way harm others. In verbal conduct, one does not use words to attack, insult, slander, or cause others pain. In mental conduct, one does not harbor malice or give rise to the intention to harm others. Only when one’s bodily, verbal, and mental deeds do not in fact bring harm to others can one be said to have truly implemented the spirit of non-harming. Only those who so thoroughly and comprehensively refrain from harming others truly deserve the title of “non-harmer,” and are not merely virtuous in name alone.

V. Methods of Benefiting Oneself and Empathetic Reflection  
V.1 The Common Desires and Aversions of All Beings  
In the practice of methods that benefit oneself, there is a foundational core way of thinking, built upon recognizing the shared feelings of all beings. All beings wish to live and long for happiness; they do not wish to die and are averse to suffering. This cherishing of life and pursuit of pleasurable experiences is not unique to any one person but exists universally in every sentient being.

V.2 Using Oneself as a Measure: Do Not Impose on Others What You Yourself Do Not Want  
After understanding this, the practitioner further reflects: whatever I myself dislike or am unwilling to endure, others likewise will not like and will not wish to experience. Based on this empathetic contemplation, a clear decision arises: one should not impose upon any other being the pains, harms, or torments that one does not oneself wish to bear. This attitude of using oneself as the measure for others is a very important core principle in methods of self-benefit. It both preserves one’s own conduct from falling into evil and at the same time prevents harm to others, thereby bringing benefit to both self and others.

VI. Purity of Bodily Conduct and Abstaining from Killing  
VI.1 Taking One’s Own Feelings as a Precept: Cutting Off Acts of Killing  
In the practice of purifying bodily actions, abstaining from killing is an extremely crucial aspect. A practitioner should repeatedly reflect: I do not wish to be killed, nor to undergo the fear and pain of having my life taken away. Since I myself do not wish to suffer such a calamity, I take this as the basis for discipline, and therefore do not kill others or deprive other beings of their lives. Proceeding from the true feelings within one’s own heart and thereby cutting off the act of killing is the concrete embodiment of putting empathetic reflection into actual behavior.

VI.2 Guiding Others to Walk the Path of Non-Killing  
However, purity of bodily conduct is not limited to merely not killing oneself. When one sees others engaging in or inclined toward killing, if one has the ability and opportunity, one should, in appropriate ways, offer guidance and encouragement, persuading them to turn away from actions that take life. At the same time, for those who already practice non-killing, one should praise and affirm them, so that their virtuous conduct is strengthened and continues. Through refraining from killing, not inciting others to kill, and joyfully commending and promoting conduct that avoids taking life, body, speech, and mind move toward purity, truly manifesting the fundamental principles of virtuous conduct and the path of non-harming.
