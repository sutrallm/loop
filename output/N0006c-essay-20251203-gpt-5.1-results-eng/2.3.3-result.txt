<title> The Practice Principles of Contemplating Feeling with Mindfulness to Be Free from Latent Defilements </title>
<article>
I. Cultivating the Liberated Nature of Mind and Mindful Endurance of Pain

In cultivating the liberated nature of mind, when faced with intense physical and mental pain, one must first establish a fundamental attitude. A practitioner should not be disturbed or upset by severe pain, but instead patiently endure these pains with right mind and right mindfulness, while maintaining inner calm, so that the mind neither becomes elated and restless nor sinks and becomes dejected. This attitude is the foundation for remaining settled even when painful feeling is present, and it is the prerequisite for all subsequent practice of contemplating feeling.

II. The Three Kinds of Feeling and Their Relationship to Latent Defilements

Regarding the correspondence between feeling and latent tendencies, if one is not clear about the nature and drawbacks of feeling, the corresponding defilements will be stirred up. When one experiences pleasant feeling but does not know that this is merely a “feeling,” and does not see that one should depart from it, then the latent tendency of attachment to sensual desire is present in the mind. When one experiences painful feeling but likewise does not know that this too is just a “feeling,” and does not see the path of departure from it, then latent anger and aversion are hidden within. As for neutral feeling, when one takes delight in this kind of feeling and abides in it, without seeking to end suffering or to be released from it, one is likewise drawn along by ignorance and bondage. When these three kinds of feeling are experienced without knowing them as feeling and without understanding the drawbacks of feeling, they nourish different types of latent defilements.

III. The Contrast Between Ordinary People and Noble Disciples in the Face of Painful Feeling

When the body comes into contact with painful feeling, the response of an uninstructed ordinary person is completely different from that of an instructed noble disciple. When an uninstructed ordinary person encounters painful sensations in the body, he often becomes distressed, exhausted, and sorrowful, even beating his chest and weeping, thereby falling into delusion. This condition is described as “never having stood on a perilous cliff, never having his feet planted on solid ground,” meaning that he has not yet taken his stand in a firm and stable place. Specifically, when faced with intense painful feeling that is severe enough to endanger his life, the uninstructed ordinary person trembles, utters cries and lamentation, and his physical and mental strength gradually weakens until it is exhausted; in the end, he can no longer endure the painful feeling that has arisen.

In contrast, when an instructed noble disciple comes into contact with painful bodily feeling, he does not become distressed, exhausted, or sorrowful because of the painful feeling, nor does he beat his chest and weep or fall into delusion because of the pain. This state is described as “having once stood on a perilous cliff and having his feet planted on solid ground,” indicating that he now stands in a stable and safe place. Specifically, when a noble disciple is faced with agonizing painful feeling severe enough to endanger his life, his mind is not shaken or intimidated; he does not tremble, but can instead endure and bear the painful feelings that arise, maintaining clarity and steadiness even in the midst of pain.

IV. Practicing Observation of Feeling and Abandoning Latent Defilements

To truly abandon the latent defilements, one must observe pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling as they really are, and understand the arising and nature of these three kinds of feeling. First, the practitioner needs to clearly know that all pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings arise due to conditions; without the corresponding conditions, they do not arise. These feelings appear dependent on a body constructed by impermanence, and therefore they themselves also carry the characteristic of impermanence.

When contemplating feeling, the practitioner should, with regard to the body and all feelings, continually observe their impermanence, observe their ceasing, observe dispassion, observe their ending and relinquishment, and abide based on this. In this way, the latent tendency of craving with regard to the body and pleasant feeling, the latent tendency of aversion with regard to the body and painful feeling, and the latent tendency of ignorance with regard to the body and neutral feeling can gradually be abandoned. Through such observation and the discernment of what to adopt and what to relinquish, the practitioner both sees clearly the conditioned arising and cessation of feelings and, at the same time, loosens the bonds related to feeling.

V. Directly Realizing the Impermanence of Feeling and Freedom from Bondage

At the very moment when feeling arises, if one can immediately recognize its impermanence, one can further experience a state of freedom from bondage. When pleasant feeling appears, the practitioner knows that it is impermanent; when painful or neutral feeling appears, he likewise understands that these too are impermanent. Precisely because he knows their impermanence, he no longer clings to these three kinds of feeling, nor rejoices in them; in the very flow of feelings he directly experiences a sense of loosening and liberation from feeling.

Further, in correctly contemplating feeling, the practitioner must clearly observe: all feelings are impermanent and will ultimately cease; therefore one should become dispassionate toward them and not be attached. They are domains that should come to an end and should be relinquished. Repeated contemplation of impermanence, of ceasing, of dispassion, of ending, and of relinquishment is the key to weakening attachment to feeling.

Within the span of life, the practitioner must also be clearly aware of the scope on which feeling depends. When the experience is confined to feelings limited by the body, he should clearly know: “I am experiencing feelings that are bounded by the body.” When the experience is of feelings limited by the life span as a whole, he should likewise understand: “I am experiencing feelings that are bounded by life.” Through such discrimination, the practitioner gains a more precise understanding of the body and life span upon which feeling depends.

VI. Basic Understanding of Feeling and the Practice of the Noble Eightfold Path and the Four Establishments of Mindfulness

At the foundation of all practice that contemplates feeling, there are four key understandings that must be clearly grasped. The practitioner must know what “feeling” is; he must also know how feeling arises. At the same time, he must be able to know, as it really is, the cessation of feeling and the specific path that leads to the cessation of feeling. If he does not fully understand feeling, the arising of feeling, the cessation of feeling, and the path leading to the cessation of feeling, he will not be able, in practice, to truly unravel the bonds related to feeling.

In order to fully understand the three kinds of feeling—pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant (neutral) feeling—the practitioner should cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path as the practical way that deals with feeling. Cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path helps the practitioner, when facing the three kinds of feeling, not only to distinguish them clearly but also to respond to them correctly, so that he is not carried away by them.

At the same time, the Four Establishments of Mindfulness are also an indispensable domain of practice for working with feeling. Within the four establishments, the practitioner should be diligent, continuously clearly aware, and endowed with right mindfulness, so as to overcome craving and distress with regard to the world. Among these four domains, especially in the aspect of “contemplating feeling,” the practitioner must directly observe feeling itself on the level of feeling. To fully understand the three kinds of feeling—pleasant, painful, and neutral—it is likewise necessary to cultivate the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. Through long-term practice of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, one’s understanding of feeling no longer remains merely conceptual, but is grounded in actual bodily and mental experience.

VII. Right Knowledge of the Five Faculties and the Conditions for Feeling

In the course of practice, directly knowing the five faculties as they really are is also an important part of becoming free from bondage to feeling. The practitioner should gain right knowledge of the arising of the five spiritual faculties, their cessation, the gratification within them, the drawbacks they contain, and the way of transcending and departing from them. Whenever any faculty arises, he must clearly understand that the arising of that faculty necessarily has conditions, causes, constructions, and supporting factors. For a certain faculty to arise without any conditions, causes, constructions, or supporting factors is impossible. This clear understanding that things arise dependent on conditions applies not only to the five faculties themselves; it also illuminates how feelings arise dependently, further weakening the reification and attachment directed toward feeling.

VIII. Direct Knowing of Feeling and Ultimate Insight into Life

When a practitioner cultivates a certain state of concentration and uses this concentration to observe feeling, then whether the feeling is pleasant, painful, or neutral, he can cultivate direct knowing within it. In this kind of practice, he gradually understands that all feelings are impermanent; regardless of their nature, not a single one can endure. He also comes to experience that all feelings should not be clung to and are not worthy of being treated with joy and greed.

The mind cultivated in such concentration can experience all feelings with a non-clinging attitude: it no longer grasps firmly at pleasant feeling, is no longer led along by painful feeling, and likewise no longer becomes enamored of neutral feeling. Going further, the practitioner realizes that all feelings are bounded only by the body and only by the life span. When the body decays and life comes to an end, everything that has ever been felt and ever been craved will completely cool down and cease, without continuation. This awareness of the ultimate state of life leads the practitioner to no longer regard feeling as a place of reliance, but to see, as it really is, that feelings ultimately return to quiescence.

IX. The Concrete Content of Practice in the Stage of Contemplating Feeling

Within the concrete sequence of practice, contemplating feeling is one clearly defined stage. At this stage, when feelings of joy and happiness arise, the practitioner must clearly be aware of these feelings of joy and happiness, and at the same time be aware of the various mental activities that are operating, gradually calming these mental activities down. This stage is called “contemplating feeling in feelings,” because the wholesome attention directed to the in‑and‑out breath itself constitutes a kind of feeling. As the practitioner gently refines his focus on the breath, he is in fact directly encountering and contemplating the feelings that arise from it, learning not to be carried away by feeling, but to abide within feeling—and at the same time go beyond feeling—with mindfulness and a tranquil mind.
