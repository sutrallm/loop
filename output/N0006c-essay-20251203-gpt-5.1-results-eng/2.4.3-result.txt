I. Four Types of Meditative Practitioners and Their Core Abilities

I.1 The Four Fundamental Types of Practitioners

In the practice of meditative concentration, practitioners can be divided into four fundamental types, based on whether they are skilled at entering meditative absorption (samādhi) and whether they are skilled at various other abilities related to samādhi.

The first type is good at entering absorption: they can enter the state of samādhi smoothly and skillfully, yet in the other skills associated with samādhi their performance is lacking and not equally proficient.

The second type is the opposite: they excel in one particular samādhi-related skill—perhaps in “equipoise” (staying evenly in absorption), “staying,” “emerging,” “ease and happiness,” “meditative object,” “field of operation,” “evocation,” “practice with reverence,” “constant practice,” or “practice in accordance with circumstances.” However, their ability to enter samādhi itself is inadequate, and they cannot enter absorption as skillfully as the first type.

The third type is neither good at entering the meditative state nor good at the other samādhi skills: they are unskilled both in entering absorption and in employing the various supporting abilities.

The fourth type is the complete one among the above: they are able both to enter the meditative state skillfully and at the same time to master at least one of the other samādhi skills. Thus they are adept in both entering absorption and in the supporting abilities.

I.2 The Full Scope of Meditative Skills

Behind these four types of practitioners lies a complete set of meditative skills, which form the basis of this classification. There is one central skill regarded as core—namely, “entering samādhi,” the ability to enter the state of meditative absorption itself.

In addition, there are several elements counted as supporting skills, which assist, complete, and strengthen the practice of samādhi.

“Equipoise” means that, after attaining samādhi, one is able to abide evenly within it, without agitation or disturbance.

“Staying” means being able to maintain a stable state of samādhi, not allowing the mind to become easily scattered or to lose its collectedness.

“Emerging” refers to rising properly from samādhi, such that when the mind comes out of absorption it does so in a calm and appropriate way, without becoming coarse, dull, or scattered.

“Ease and happiness” means truly experiencing ease and pleasant feeling within samādhi, so that the meditative state becomes a pure and peaceful support.

“Meditative object” refers to the ability, in the course of meditation, to remain focused on the chosen object of practice, neither deviating from it nor abandoning it, but firmly tethering mindfulness to it.

“Field of operation” means that, within the domain of samādhi, one can move and apply the mind appropriately, being able to use the mind rightly in the meditative state without being bound or confused by the object.

“Evocation” is the ability to bring forth the various virtues of samādhi itself, so that the power of absorption can manifest and exert its function.

“Practice with reverence” means cultivating samādhi with a reverent mind: at the beginning of practice, in the continuation of practice, and in the protection of samādhi, one’s mind is imbued with respect and carefulness, free from negligence and contempt.

“Constant practice” means cultivating samādhi continuously and without interruption, making the practice into a long-term, sustained implementation rather than something done only occasionally.

“Practice in accordance with circumstances” is the ability to practice appropriately in harmony with conditions, knowing at what time and in what situation one should cultivate samādhi in which manner, and being skillful in adjusting and applying it rather than rigidly clinging to one fixed way.

Taken together, these skills form a complete system for the cultivation of meditative concentration.

I.3 The Highest Standard for a Fully Accomplished Practitioner

When speaking of a fully accomplished practitioner of samādhi, there is a clear and rigorous highest standard. According to this standard, one must possess two kinds of mastery at the same time.

On the one hand, one must be quite proficient in the core skill of “entering samādhi,” able to enter meditative absorption freely and steadily.

On the other hand, one must also reach a similar level of mastery in at least one of the supporting skills mentioned above—whether it be equipoise, staying, emerging, ease and happiness, meditative object, field of operation, evocation, practice with reverence, constant practice, or practice in accordance with circumstances. As long as any one of these is mastered to the same degree as entering samādhi, so that it pairs with it, one meets this standard of completeness.

A practitioner who is simultaneously skilled in entering samādhi and in at least one supporting skill is regarded as the most honorable, excellent, lofty, and outstanding type among those who cultivate samādhi.

II. Patterns of Combination of Samādhi Abilities and the Relation of the Seven Factors

II.1 Four Basic Patterns of Combination

From a broader perspective, practitioners of samādhi can be observed not only in terms of entering absorption and the other skills, but also in terms of whether they are skilled in any given pair of qualities.

If we look only at the relation between two qualities, each practitioner can roughly be placed into one of four basic patterns:  

Some are skilled in one quality but unskilled in the other.  

Some are skilled in the second quality but unskilled in the first.  

Some are unskilled in both, lacking ability in both aspects.  

And some are skilled in both qualities, fully mastering these two dimensions.

Viewed in this way, those who are skilled in both of a given pair of qualities are always regarded as the highest and most excellent among all types, ranking above those who are skilled in only one of the two or unskilled in both.

II.2 Concrete Combinations among the Seven Samādhi Factors

Among these patterns of combination, one set in particular discusses seven qualities related to samādhi. These seven are: the ease and happiness of samādhi, the meditative object of samādhi, the field of operation of samādhi, the evocation of samādhi, practicing samādhi with reverence, constant practice of samādhi, and practicing samādhi in accordance with circumstances.

The combination of these qualities among themselves in principle follows the four basic patterns mentioned above: “one skilled, one unskilled,” “this unskilled, that skilled,” “both unskilled,” and “both skilled.” However, the text especially points out several concrete cases of one-sided emphasis.

First, regarding the ease and happiness of samādhi in relation to the other six qualities, the following states may arise:

There may be someone who is skilled in the ease and happiness of samādhi—truly able to experience ease and happiness in meditation—yet unskilled in the samādhi meditative object, unable to hold the meditation object firmly.

There may be someone skilled in samādhi ease and happiness but unskilled in the samādhi field of operation: although they attain ease, they are not good at moving and applying the mind within the meditative domain.

There may be someone skilled in samādhi ease and happiness but unskilled in samādhi evocation, unable skillfully to bring forth the various virtues of samādhi.

There may be someone for whom samādhi ease and happiness is strong, but who is unskilled in practicing samādhi with reverence, lacking a reverent heart toward samādhi itself.

There may be someone skilled in samādhi ease and happiness but unskilled in constant practice of samādhi, unable to cultivate absorption continuously and without interruption.

Or there may be someone skilled in samādhi ease and happiness but unskilled in practicing in accordance with circumstances, unable to harmonize with conditions and arrange their samādhi practice appropriately.

These examples show that some people specialize in gaining ease and happiness in samādhi, yet are deficient in each of the other six samādhi-related qualities.

Next, with respect to the samādhi meditative object and each of the other five qualities, there are similar patterns of combination:

Some practitioners are skilled in the samādhi meditative object—able to stay focused on the chosen meditation object without distraction—yet unskilled in the samādhi field of operation, unable to apply their mind properly within the meditative domain.

Some are skilled in the meditative object but unskilled in samādhi evocation, unable effectively to bring forth the many virtues of samādhi.

There may be those who are skilled in the meditative object yet unskilled in practicing samādhi with reverence, lacking a heart of respect and reverence toward meditative practice.

Some may be skilled in the meditative object but unskilled in constant practice, not cultivating samādhi with sufficient continuity and thus unable to sustain it.

Others may be skilled in the meditative object but unskilled in practicing in accordance with circumstances, unable to arrange and adjust their meditation skillfully in light of different times and conditions.

Although the above examples all concern the situation of “one quality skilled, one quality unskilled,” in line with what was said earlier, all of these qualities can in principle fall under any of the four basic patterns of combination. This passage simply gives particular emphasis to those cases where “one aspect has been mastered, while another aspect is not yet skillful.”

II.3 The Supreme Status of Those Skilled in Both Qualities

Among all these various combinations of samādhi-related factors—whether we consider entering absorption and the supporting skills, or we examine ease and happiness, meditative object, field of operation, evocation, practice with reverence, constant practice, and practice in accordance with circumstances in relation to one another—there is a single consistent evaluative standard:

Whoever is able to attain mastery in both of a given pair of related aspects is always regarded as the highest and most excellent. Such a person not only avoids falling into the state of “one skilled, one unskilled” or “both unskilled,” but is fully endowed in both qualities. Therefore, in comparison with practitioners who have achievements in only one factor or are deficient in both, they are especially outstanding.

III. Concrete Rules for Determining the Highest Practitioners of Samādhi

III.1 Key Combinations: Field of Operation and Evocation; Constant Practice and Practice in Accordance with Circumstances

Within the many possible combinations of samādhi-related factors, there is a particularly clear set of rules for determining who counts as the highest practitioner of samādhi.

First, regarding the two factors “field of operation” and “evocation”: if a practitioner is skilled in the field of operation of samādhi, able to use the mind rightly within the meditative domain, and at the same time skilled in samādhi evocation, able effectively to bring forth the virtues of samādhi, such a practitioner is judged, with respect to this combination, to be the highest and most excellent.

Second, if we look from the perspective of the pair “constant practice” and “practice in accordance with circumstances”: if a practitioner is able to cultivate samādhi continuously and without interruption, and at the same time can practice appropriately in harmony with conditions, knowing how to adjust and arrange their conduct in light of different situations, that person is praised as the most honorable, most excellent, foremost, highest, and most wonderful type under this pair of qualities.

From this we see that possessing dual mastery in field of operation and evocation, and dual mastery in constant practice and practice in accordance with circumstances, is considered a key basis for determining whether one’s cultivation of samādhi has reached the highest level.

III.2 How to Identify the Highest Practitioners of Samādhi

According to the above rules, identifying whether a practitioner can be called a highest practitioner of samādhi does not actually require examining every possible combination of qualities. One need only inspect a few key pairs.

Specifically, observe two focal points:  

First, whether the practitioner is skilled in both field of operation and evocation.  

Second, whether they are skilled in both constant practice and practice in accordance with circumstances.

As long as, in either of these two pairs, the practitioner attains the state of “both skilled,” they can, according to these rules, be judged to be a highest practitioner of samādhi.

In other words, fulfilling either “skilled in both field of operation and evocation” or “skilled in both constant practice and practice in accordance with circumstances” is already sufficient to establish their status as highest, most excellent, most honorable, most supreme, and foremost.

IV. The Day-and-Night Schedule for Focused Wakefulness

IV.1 Daytime Practice

In addition to the various abilities and evaluative standards described above, the practice of samādhi also involves a concrete day-and-night schedule to help practitioners maintain a state of focused wakefulness.

During the day, practitioners take walking meditation and sitting as their main modes of practice. By repeatedly walking back and forth and sitting upright, they continuously observe and regulate their own mind, thereby clearing away various obstructive phenomena within it, so that the internal hindrances that obstruct samādhi and wisdom are constantly washed away. This repeated walking and sitting throughout the day is both a regulation of physical conduct and a purification of mental conduct.

IV.2 The Three Night Watches of Practice

At night, practice is further divided into three periods: the first watch, the middle watch, and the last watch of the night, each with its own specific focus.

During the first watch, practitioners still rely mainly on walking meditation and sitting, as in the daytime, working to remove the obstructive phenomena within the mind, so that as night begins the body and mind already tend toward clarity and calm.

During the middle watch, practitioners change posture and rest lying on the right side in the lion’s posture, the body reclining on the right as a lion sleeps, with stability and uprightness. At the same time they maintain mindfulness and clear comprehension while lying down, so that the mind does not lose its awareness and remains in a state of continual alertness.

Entering the last watch of the night, practitioners rise again and once more take walking meditation and sitting as their main practices, continuing to remove the obstructive phenomena within the mind.

In this way, from day into night, and at night further divided into three watches, the overall arrangement of practice keeps body and mind almost constantly in a state of focused wakefulness and purification.

V. Bodily Transformations Brought by the Unity of Body and Mind

V.1 Lightness, Flexibility, Fitness for Work, and Purity of the Body

When practitioners follow the above principles and sequence over the long term, cultivating samādhi and mindfulness and bringing body and mind into harmony and unity, one of the most direct and obvious effects will appear in the body itself. Because body and mind have become unified, several changes occur in the body.

First, the body becomes light and soft: it no longer feels heavy and obstructed, but displays a state of lightness and ease.

Second, the body becomes fit for work—that is, the body becomes more capable of sustaining long periods of walking meditation, sitting, and various meditative postures, not easily feeling tired or uncomfortable, and able to bear all the regulation required by practice.

Furthermore, the body becomes pure, not only in the sense of outwardly proper conduct, but also in the sense that, because the mind is pure, bodily behavior appears clear and unstained, forming a state of purity in which body and mind are in harmony.

These three changes are direct, natural effects that appear once body and mind have mutually coordinated and been mutually regulated in samādhi.

VI. Two Supreme Results Achieved through the Practice of Samādhi

VI.1 Vast and Excellent Benefits and Two Possible Outcomes

When a practitioner cultivates and implements samādhi as described above—discerning the four types of practitioners, understanding the core and supporting skills, grasping the various relations between pairs of qualities, examining and improving oneself in light of the criteria for the highest practitioners of samādhi, arranging walking meditation, sitting, and lion’s posture continuously day and night, and thereby bringing the body toward lightness, fitness, and purity—then they will obtain vast and excellent benefits from this practice.

These benefits appear not only in the state of body and mind, but also in the final attainments of path and fruit. For a practitioner who steadily follows this path, there are two possible outcomes in terms of expected results:

First, they may realize enlightenment in this very life, attaining complete awakening before the present life has come to an end.

Second, if they have not yet fully awakened in this life, they will at least reach the state of non-returning, that is, they will no longer return to the realm of sensual desire to undergo birth and death.

Both of these outcomes rest upon the entire rigorous, detailed, and coherent system of samādhi practice described above, and thus are called vast and excellent attainments.
