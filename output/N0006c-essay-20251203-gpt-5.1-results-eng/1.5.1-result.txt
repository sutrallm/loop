<title> Mind-Consciousness, Discernment, and Liberation: The Complete Principle from Defilement to Purity </title>

<article>

I. Mind-Consciousness and Craving as What Governs the World  

Everything that operates in the world is led by mind and craving, and it is also because of mind and craving that the world becomes chaotic and troubled. All phenomena, without exception, belong to name, mind, and craving; they all unfold under the governance of these three, and this constitutes a fundamental law of the world.

In everyday experience, all the objects of the five sensual pleasures—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles—are divided, in the mind, into what it likes and what it does not like. The liking or aversion that each person develops toward the five sensual objects is entirely determined by their own mind; the external objects themselves do not determine the degree of liking. What truly plays the decisive role is always the mind.

On a broader level, the state of mind-consciousness determines the level of a person’s thoughts, views, and perceptions; and different levels of mind-consciousness give rise to corresponding levels of life-expression. When mind-consciousness is inferior, there appear lowly thoughts, speech, and modes of life. When mind-consciousness is middling, it manifests in middling thoughts, speech, and modes of life. When mind-consciousness is excellent, it brings about excellent thoughts, speech, and modes of life. The manifestations of these different levels concretely include ideas, views, and perceptions, as well as thinking, aspirations, and aims; they also include verbal expression, behavioral conduct, and the overall mode of life. Above all these levels, ignorance (unawareness) is itself a vast and fundamental state of mind-consciousness. The state of ignorance permeates and influences all levels of mental expression, making them defiled and impure.

Thus, mind is the fundamental locus of both defilement and purity. Through the long night of saṃsāra, mind is often defiled by greed, hatred, and delusion. Once the mind is defiled, sentient beings are thereby defiled; conversely, when the mind is pure, beings are therefore pure. The turmoil or stability of the world is thus suspended on a single thought.

II. The Practitioner’s Basic Attitude toward Mind-Consciousness  

Given the crucial importance of mind-consciousness, a practitioner must maintain a particular attitude and method of taming their own mind in practice. First, in cultivating mind-consciousness, one should strive to maintain an inner state of stillness, so that the mind is not shaken by external situations, and further, to go beyond all kinds of discriminative thoughts, not following the rise and fall of delusive imaginings.

To reach such a state, one must deal with the afflictions at their root. A practitioner needs to completely cut off all greed and delight that arise from ignorance, not drawing near to craving, maintaining oneself in a state of non-greed and non-desire. Only this thorough distancing can truly shake the root of affliction.

When displeasure arises in the heart, or when the mind is polluted by craving, a practitioner should immediately become aware of this state, clearly knowing that they are in an unwholesome state of mind. One should also distinctly recognize that it is necessary to rely on one’s own strength to dispel the displeasure, to let the mind once again give rise to joy and tranquility, rather than relying on others to solve one’s inner predicament.

Therefore, one should constantly observe one’s own mind, understanding whether the present mind is pure or defiled, and continuously reminding oneself that mind is impermanent and easily changing. If it is not carefully observed and tamed, it will very quickly be stained by greed, hatred, and delusion.

III. The Nature, Classification, and Role of Consciousness in Life  

In all psychological activities, “consciousness” (識) occupies an extremely crucial position. There are six types of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness. Their common function is to recognize and cognize within their respective domains, enabling beings to distinguish forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects (dharmas).

From the perspective of dependent arising, consciousness exists in dependence on formations (saṅkhāras); formations are the fundamental cause, source, arising, and origin of consciousness. That is, various activities and karmic constructions become the conditions for consciousness to arise and continue. The two mutually condition and depend on each other.

From the standpoint of the “four nutriments,” the nutriment of consciousness is precisely the activity of mind-consciousness itself. It takes name-and-form—that is, all physical and mental phenomena—as its object of grasping, thereby maintaining the continuity of life. What the nutriment of consciousness cognizes is exactly this domain of name-and-form. When a noble disciple has directly known this fully and dealt with it completely, then in regard to this nutriment of consciousness there is nothing further left to do; they have reached the point of final liberation.

However, when contemplating the five aggregates, one must adopt a particularly cautious attitude toward the aggregate of consciousness. Consciousness is like the illusions produced by a conjurer: outwardly it appears to truly exist, yet in fact it is as if there is something, but nothing substantial at all. Through subtle observation, one can discover that within it there is no real, enduring subject—no fixed, unchanging “self” that can be found.

Even so, prior to liberation, consciousness still functions like a lord of a city stationed in the center, residing at the core of all bodily and mental activities, governing and directing all inner operations. Specifically, mind-consciousness is the final point of convergence for the five sense faculties, responsible for receiving and processing all the information transmitted by eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. And mind-consciousness itself is oriented toward “mindfulness” (recollection), which guides the direction of consciousness, making it turn toward specific objects and operate there.

The diversity and creativity of mind and consciousness are also manifested here. The various patterns of “formations” are actually images drawn by thinking in the mind, and the changes of mind itself are even more varied than those images. Though the species of animals are many, they are still but ideas conceived by thinking in the mind, and the possibilities of what the mind can manifest are more numerous than the kinds of animals. Just as a dyer or painter uses various dyes on boards, walls, or cloths to depict different images, so too an unlearned ordinary person repeatedly arouses within their own mind the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, and so repeatedly constructs and reconstructs life.

IV. Differences in Thought, Feeling, and the Pleasure–Pain Brought by the Three Kinds of Formations  

In the relationship between action and its result, the key factor is whether the intention in the mind is right or wrong. A wholesome or unwholesome mind will manifest through the three channels of body, speech, and mind. When a mind is wholesome or unwholesome, if it is expressed through bodily actions, this constitutes bodily formations and leads to a corresponding experience of pleasure or pain. If it is expressed through speech, it becomes verbal formations, likewise bringing a corresponding pleasure or pain. If it operates only internally, it is mental formations, and according to whether they are right or wrong, one experiences different kinds of pleasure and suffering.

Looking at all activities as a whole, “formations” can be divided into three types: bodily formations, verbal formations, and mental formations. In-breaths and out-breaths are bodily activities; they are bound up with the body and thus are called bodily formations. Applied thought and sustained thought always precede the utterance of speech; they are inner activities before speaking and thus are called verbal formations. Perception and feeling belong entirely to the mind; they are bound up with the mind, so they are classified as mental formations.

Within the psychological process, an unmistakable chain can be seen. Different kinds of feeling give rise to different mental inclinations and reflections; different mental inclinations give rise to different desires; various desires further give rise to differing degrees of clinging and inner heat; different clingings lead to corresponding kinds of pursuits; and these pursuits finally result in different forms of acquisition and grasping.

Thus every arising of a thought has its definite cause; it never arises without conditions. When the mind comes into contact with an object, a preliminary idea first arises, then this gives rise to deeper reflection, then forms specific intentions, causing inner fervor to increase, and finally leads to an active pursuit of that object or goal. In this process, thoughts can be roughly divided into two types. One type is unwholesome thoughts, including the intention of sensual desire, ill will, and harming; the other type is wholesome thoughts, including the intention of renunciation, non-hatred, and non-harming.

V. The Choices of Ordinary People and Noble Disciples and Their Results  

Driven by thoughts, the behaviors of ordinary people and noble disciples present completely different patterns. Ordinary people, lacking right view, often follow unwholesome thoughts, chasing after sensual desire, hatred, and harm, and through body, speech, and mind commit various mistaken acts. By contrast, noble disciples, because they possess right view, deliberately cultivate wholesome thoughts, taking renunciation, non-hatred, and non-harming as their aims, and concretely practice correct and pure conduct in body, speech, and mind.

In dealing with improper thoughts, there is a core principle that must be followed: once such a thought arises, it should be abandoned, excluded, crushed, and destroyed immediately, not allowed to remain and grow. If one can counteract it on the spot, the mind can immediately settle in happiness, no longer tormented by disturbance and sorrow; and after the end of this life, one will thereby be led to a good destination. Conversely, if one fails to counteract it in time, one will at once experience suffering, the heart filled with disturbance and sorrow; and after death one will be led to a bad destination.

Even in a layperson’s worldly life and conduct, this law of mental intentions still applies. The ideal is to keep the mind in a state of non-attachment, non-grasping, and non-bondage. In such a state, when the mind wishes to obtain something, it will as wished obtain it; when the mind wishes to accomplish some merit or good deed, that merit will likewise be fulfilled.

VI. Thought, Reflection, and the Causes and Conditions for the Standing of Consciousness  

From another angle, the very thinking, planning, and deliberating within the mind become the objects (supports) for consciousness. When consciousness grasps these objects, it thereby stands and abides. Precisely because consciousness can abide and continue to stand and grow, it eventually leads to future rebirth. Thus, the activity of thinking is the basis upon which consciousness can abide and increase.

Conversely, if there is no longer any thinking, no planning, no deliberation, then consciousness loses the objects it can rely on. With nothing to grasp as its object, consciousness cannot stand or abide, and so has no way to grow.

From this we know that the arising and cessation of all activities of mind-consciousness hinge on this point. As long as there are activities of thinking, planning, deliberating, they will inevitably become objects to which consciousness clings. If there are no such activities, consciousness no longer has any objects to cling to. Once consciousness has an object to cling to, it comes to a halt there; when there is no object to cling to, it does not stop there. When consciousness stops, it then grows; the growth of consciousness in turn leads to clinging. If consciousness never stops, it does not grow; without growth, clinging does not arise. Because there is clinging, the mode of life moves back and forth among various states of existence, and this moving back and forth becomes the cause for the continuity of birth and death. Without clinging, there is no such moving back and forth and thus no continuity of birth and death. The continuity of birth and death brings, in future lives, birth, aging, and death, as well as sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, all kinds of suffering. If there is no longer continuity of birth and death, these sufferings are extinguished accordingly.

To bring an end to all this clinging based on thinking, one must grasp the core principle of “non-thinking.” Non-thinking includes not thinking about the object itself, not thinking about the existence of the object, not letting new thoughts arise again on account of the object, and not taking the object as “I” or “mine” and thinking on that basis. In this way, one can, from the root, deprive consciousness of the conditions for clinging and standing.

VII. Afflictions, Bondage, and Various Inner Shackles  

Among all afflictions, a fundamental link is the greed and delight that arise from ignorance. A practitioner must completely cut off all greed and delight that arise from ignorance, and even avoid coming close to craving, allowing the mind to abide for a long time in a pure state free from greed and desire.

If one cannot do this, life will be constrained by various deep bonds. These bonds can be observed in four main forms. The first are the “floods,” of which there are four: the flood of sensual desire, the flood of becoming, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance. The second are the “yokes,” also four: the yoke of sensual desire, the yoke of becoming, the yoke of views, and the yoke of ignorance. The third is “clinging” (upādāna), including four types: clinging to sensual desire, clinging to views, clinging to rules and vows, and clinging to a doctrine of self. The fourth are the “bonds,” which are: bondage by craving, bondage by hatred, bondage by clinging to rules and vows, and bondage by the belief “this alone is true” (rigid dogmatic grasping).

Corresponding to these are seven latent tendencies (anusaya) of affliction, which lie hidden in the mind and may manifest again whenever conditions are ripe. These seven latent tendencies are: the latent tendency to sensual lust, the latent tendency to anger, the latent tendency to views, the latent tendency to doubt, the latent tendency to conceit, the latent tendency to lust for becoming, and the latent tendency to ignorance. Furthermore, at higher stages of practice, one also needs to cut off the five “higher fetters”: attachment to existence in the form realm, attachment to existence in the formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance of the truth.

In everyday mental activity, these afflictions often appear as a state of “being submerged in the current,” meaning that the mind gives rise to joy and craving toward an object, as if being swept away by a rapid stream. Thus, the mind is either directed toward sensual desire, clinging to it and fixated on it, or else turned away from sensual desire, not clinging, and not fixated. The two orientations are sharply distinguished.

At the same time, there are five forms of mental bondage that further shackle life. These five are: conceptual proliferation about self, mental spinning, mental agitation, idle speculation, and conceit. Although their outward forms differ, they share a common fault: each is a disease, like a festering sore, like a sharp arrow lodged within the body, causing intense pain. “Conceptual proliferation about self” is a tight, unyielding clinging to all concepts related to “I.” “Mental spinning” is the repeated inner wavering and swinging around this same set of concepts. “Mental agitation” is the strong and violent shaking of the mind in the face of these same concepts. “Idle speculation” is engaging in fanciful, useless differentiations and discussions based on this same conceptual set. “Conceit” is the arising of arrogance and pride on the basis of these concepts. The true path of liberation lies in learning to abide in a state free from these five mental bonds—that is, to let the mind remain unbound and at ease in regard to each type of mental bondage.

VIII. Attention, Mental Orientation, and the Manifestation of Wisdom  

The way the mind “attends,” that is, where it places its focus, has a decisive impact on the growth or disappearance of mental qualities. If a person continuously and repeatedly places attention on objects that nourish unwholesome states, then unwholesome states that have not yet arisen will be brought about, and those that have already arisen will grow and expand. Conversely, if one long maintains attention on objects that nourish the factors of awakening, then factors of awakening not yet arisen will begin to arise, and those already arisen will continue to be cultivated toward fulfillment. This principle universally applies to the various specific states of mind described below.

From this, one can further understand the completely different results brought about by “wise attention” and “unwise attention.” Unwise attention—that is, a way of thinking that does not accord with the truth and is erroneous—inevitably leads to the arising and increase of unwholesome states, and causes the factors of awakening that ought to arise either never to arise or to gradually vanish. Wise attention—thinking in ways that accord with truth and are correct—prevents unwholesome states from arising, or, if they have already arisen, leads to their abandonment, while at the same time causing factors of awakening to arise and finally be cultivated to completion.

With regard to wisdom, whether mind-consciousness is entangled by afflictions is the decisive factor for whether wisdom can appear. When mind-consciousness is bound by afflictions and long dwells in an afflicted state, it cannot clearly know how to depart from the afflictions that have arisen. Because of this, one cannot clearly know oneself, nor truly understand others and their mutual true benefit. Even with long-term study of the scriptures, under such conditions it is difficult to realize true wisdom. Conversely, if mind-consciousness is not entangled by afflictions and does not dwell long in an afflicted state, then one can clearly know how to depart from the afflictions that have arisen; one can clearly understand oneself and others, and grasp their mutual true benefit. Even without long-term scriptural study, one can still naturally realize genuine wisdom.

Thus, in all contemplative practice, the key to success or failure lies in whether one “knows well the nature of the mind.” A practitioner must clearly discern the present state of their mind and the state of the object contemplated, and, based on this discernment, adjust and harmonize their method of practice. If one cannot do this—if one “does not know the nature of the mind,” unable to clearly recognize the mind’s present state and the state of the object—one cannot make corresponding and correct adjustments. A practitioner who knows well the nature of the mind can gather the mind and obtain concentration, can cut off secondary afflictions, can acquire a pleasant dwelling in this very life, and can accomplish right mindfulness and clear comprehension. Conversely, one who does not know the nature of the mind cannot gather the mind into concentration, cannot cut off secondary afflictions, cannot obtain a pleasant dwelling in this life, and finds it difficult to accomplish right mindfulness and clear comprehension.

IX. The Six Faculties, the Purity or Defilement of Mind-Consciousness, and the Disturbance of Afflictions  

When the eye sees forms, the ear hears sounds, the nose smells odors, the tongue tastes flavors, the body senses tangibles, and the mind apprehends mental objects, various external situations may at any time give rise to evil, unwholesome recollections and intentions. The arising of these unwholesome thoughts in turn sets in motion factors that bind the mind, plunging it into various fetters.

Therefore, whether mind-consciousness is defiled or pure first depends on whether the six sense faculties are properly guarded. If the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not well restrained, mind-consciousness will often be quickly defiled. Once mind-consciousness is defiled, all subsequent psychological phenomena and results in practice unfold with this as their starting point. Conversely, if the six faculties are properly guarded in accordance with the Dhamma, so that mind-consciousness remains undefiled, then all the subsequent mental processes and fruits of practice will start from purity.

In terms of the concrete chain of effects: if the initial state is defiled mind-consciousness, then true joy and happiness will not arise, nor genuine gladness. The body and mind therefore do not attain lightness and ease, but can only dwell in suffering. In such a condition the mind does not gain concentration, and various realities (dharmas) do not clearly appear in the mind. If the initial state is undefiled mind-consciousness, then joy naturally arises, followed by gladness. The body and mind thereby attain lightness and ease, dwelling in happiness. In such a state, the mind gains concentration, and various realities clearly present themselves in the mind.

This echoes another fundamental principle: when the six consciousnesses perceive external objects, it is the presence or absence of internal afflictions such as greed, hatred, and delusion that truly determines whether the mind is disturbed by external objects. If afflictions have not yet been removed, even a very small amount of external stimulation is sufficient to shake and disturb the mind; the more numerous and stronger the external stimuli, the more intense the disturbance. If afflictions have been cut off, then even a great number of external objects cannot disturb the mind, and all the more so a small amount of stimuli. This principle applies universally to the details of all sense experience: regardless of which consciousness is perceiving which external object, the sole decisive factor for whether the mind is disturbed is the presence or absence of internal greed, hatred, and delusion—not the quantity of external objects.

X. The Growth of Consciousness, Clinging, and the Sequence toward Liberation  

As an overall principle, as long as mind-consciousness is blocked and clings to anything, true liberation is impossible. Only when mind-consciousness is no longer blocked, no longer clinging to any object, can liberation be realized.

At the level of the five aggregates, if mind-consciousness clings to any one aggregate among form, feeling, perception, and formations, it will abide by taking that aggregate as its object. Because of clinging to it and taking delight in it, consciousness keeps growing and expanding. The process of liberation lies precisely in cutting off craving toward any one of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness. When these cravings are completely cut off, consciousness loses its conditions for growth and its basis of support. Once consciousness has nothing to rely on, it no longer grows or manifests, and thus becomes liberated. Through liberation it gains true abiding; through abiding it naturally becomes content; through contentment it is free of all fear. In the end, the practitioner can realize Nibbāna, directly knowing that their life has been completely purified and that there will be no further round of birth and death.

To reach such a state, one must rely on seeing things as they really are and on transforming the mind. That is, one should, with correct wisdom, contemplate the true nature of all phenomena. Having seen their reality, one naturally develops disenchantment toward all conditioned things, thereby reaching dispassion. The mind then gradually inclines toward cessation and liberation. Especially when contemplating the aggregate of consciousness, one should often remind oneself that consciousness is like the illusions of a conjurer: it seems real, but in truth there is no fixed, unchanging subject within it. Such contemplation helps loosen one’s clinging to consciousness.

When a practitioner truly understands the real meaning of “liberation of mind” and “liberation by wisdom,” they realize that these two are precisely the key to the elimination of unwholesome states. Because one has gained the knowledge of liberation, all evil and unwholesome states can be utterly destroyed, leaving no residual habit or remnant.

XI. Samādhi, Non-Abiding of Mind, and the Imperturbability of Body and Mind  

Since mind-consciousness occupies such a central place in the entire life process, a practitioner ought to cultivate samādhi, using concentration to tame and purify the heart. In this cultivation, one must let the mind remain still, unmoved by external situations, and go beyond all discriminations and delusive thoughts. Once one has truly entered samādhi, one should know one’s own state as it really is, without self-deception or confusion.

Within more subtle methods of realization, there are two especially important ways of working with the mind. One is to establish, focus, and maintain the mind in the “sphere of infinite consciousness,” letting it abide without distraction in this domain of boundless knowing. The other is to keep the mind free from heedlessness, placing and maintaining it in the “sphere of nothingness,” that is, a state that has left behind all grasping at “something” or “some thing,” abiding securely in a realm where there is “nothing” to be owned or possessed.

To unfold such states of mind-consciousness, one must cultivate with a vast mind that is not entangled by any affliction, letting the mind become broad and unobstructed. At the same time, one must cultivate a radiant mind, making the inner heart bright and clear. One also needs to persist in practice and repeatedly cultivate, so that one’s training steadily increases and mind-consciousness is truly developed.

When the powers of samādhi and liberation are mature, the state in which body and mind are not moved by circumstances becomes an actual experience. Even if the body undergoes violent change, the mind will not therefore be altered; even if the sense faculties are destroyed, the mind does not thereby deteriorate. Body and mind are thus separated: the body can perish, yet the mind remains bright and unmoving.

Furthermore, if one has long cultivated a particular set of five factors, one’s mind-consciousness will, at the very moment the physical body is destroyed, still rise upward and continue to progress. This principle applies to all who practice these five factors: regardless of how the physical body is eventually destroyed, if they have long cultivated them, their mind-consciousness will still gain elevation and will not sink down together with the physical body.

XII. The Creativity of Mind-Consciousness, Group Convergence, and the Flow of Will  

Because mind and will have powerful directing and creative functions, beings, at the most basic level, come to connect with and merge into groups that correspond to the quality of their volition. That is, beings who share similar intentions and characters naturally gather together, forming mutually compatible groups.

Likewise, beings are linked and drawn together according to the nature of their thoughts. Thoughts of the same kind inevitably attract and combine with one another. The purity or defilement, breadth or narrowness of a person’s mental states thus determines with which beings they will resonate, and with which realms they will be in harmony. Over long cycles of wandering, this shapes their distinct life-paths and destinations.
