<title> The World Structure of the Six Sense Bases and Six Sense Objects, and the Path to the Cessation of Suffering and Liberation </title>
<article>
I. Correct View and the Basic Constitution of the World

Rightly understanding the Teaching is the fundamental condition that prevents a practitioner from straying into wrong paths and confused delusion. When a person can understand these teachings as they really are and correctly, he will not fall into wrong views and erroneous paths, and thus can realize the truth. With such right view, he can walk calmly in the midst of the world, not shaken by external conditions, not led around by confusion.

From the instruction of the Noble Ones, the arising and constitution of the whole world fundamentally hinge on the framework of “six.” The world arises because of the “six,” aggregates upon the “six,” and, due to clinging to the “six,” experiences suffering. Here, the “six” refers to the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—and their corresponding six external sense objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects (dhammā)—together with the various types of consciousness, contact, and feeling that arise dependent on them. The cognition and thinking that an ordinary person generates based on these six sense capacities constitute what he takes to be “the world.” Therefore, the concept of “world” as it is known by an ordinary person is itself called “world” in the teachings of the Noble Ones; and all the world-perceptions and world-thoughts that arise in dependence on the six sense bases are precisely the concrete constituents of the world.

Within this world-structure there also exist seven types of realms, called the seven bases (or spheres): the base of light, the base of purity, the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and the base of the cessation of perception and feeling. Each of these seven has its own law of cognition: the base of light must rely on darkness in order to be known; the base of purity must rely on impurity to be known; the base of the infinity of space must rely on material form to be known; the base of the infinity of consciousness must rely on the infinity of space to be known; the base of nothingness must rely on the infinity of consciousness to be known; the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception must rely on nothingness to be known; and the base of the cessation of perception and feeling must rely on cessation to be known. All realms become objects of cognition only through contrast with, or transcendence of, their immediate opposite or preceding realm.

Apart from these fine-grained classifications of realms, the whole tangible material world can be reduced to four basic great elements: the earth element, water element, fire element, and air (wind) element. These four elements constitute the basis of the material body-and-mind. In another, more extensive classification there is the teaching of six elements: earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. Together, these elements constitute all phenomena of body-and-mind and of the world, forming the basic framework of cognition and existence.

II. The Six Sense Bases, Six Sense Objects, Six Consciousnesses, Six Contacts, and Cognitive Activity

In the basic structure of cognitive activity, there are first the six internal perceptual factors, namely the six sense capacities of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Corresponding to these are the six external objects of perception: forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects. When each sense capacity comes into contact with its corresponding object, six types of discriminative functions arise: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness. These consciousnesses are produced by the contact between sense capacity and corresponding object; they are the core media of cognition.

From the standpoint of “elements” (dhātus), the Blessed One summarized all of this as the eighteen elements, forming a complete cognitive system. “The various elements” refers precisely to these diverse classes of elements. Concretely, they are: the eye element, form element, eye-consciousness element; the ear element, sound element, ear-consciousness element; the nose element, odor element, nose-consciousness element; the tongue element, taste element, tongue-consciousness element; the body element, tangible element, body-consciousness element; and the mind element, mental-object element, mind-consciousness element. These eighteen elements can be further grouped into three strata: (1) the six sense-base elements, from eye element to mind element; (2) the six object elements, from form element to mental-object element; and (3) the six consciousness elements, from eye-consciousness element to mind-consciousness element. Sense base, object, and consciousness together constitute the three essential factors of the complete cognitive structure.

When the six perceptual factors—that is, the six sense bases and the six objects—encounter one another, there arises the corresponding contact, called “phassa” (contact). Contact itself has a precise definition: it is the cognitive contact that arises when sense base, object, and consciousness meet and combine. Thus, the ultimate source of contact is the six “bases” or six “domains,” namely the six sense bases and their fields. Contact can be further divided into six types: eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact, corresponding to the contact involved in each of the six sensory channels. The common factors of the six sensory domains are: there are the six sense organs—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind; there are the six corresponding external objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects; and on that basis there arise the six consciousnesses—eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness. When sense organ, external object, and consciousness unite, contact is produced.

This operation is especially important in the processes of the accumulation and cessation of the aggregates of suffering. When the eye base comes into contact with visual forms, eye-consciousness arises; when the ear base comes into contact with sounds, ear-consciousness arises; when the nose base comes into contact with odors, nose-consciousness arises; when the tongue base comes into contact with tastes, tongue-consciousness arises; when the body base comes into contact with tangibles, body-consciousness arises; when the mind base comes into contact with mental objects, mind-consciousness arises. This law—that six consciousnesses arise from contact between the six sense bases and the six sense objects—applies universally to all sensory domains. Sense base, object, and consciousness conjoin to form contact, and contact further becomes the root of feeling; feeling arises with contact as its fundamental condition. For each sensory channel, the feeling born of eye-contact, the feeling born of ear-contact, the feeling born of nose-contact, the feeling born of tongue-contact, the feeling born of body-contact, and the feeling born of mind-contact may be pleasant feeling, painful feeling, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.

Within all cognitive and mental activities, in addition to sense base, object, consciousness, and contact, there are the feelings born of contact, together with the various related mental functions. Perceptions of forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are the six perceptions (saññā) that arise regarding the six objects; volitions (thoughts/intentions) about forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are the six volitions (saṅkhārā) that arise based on the six objects; and desires for forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are the six cravings (taṇhā) that arise because of the six objects. Thus, starting from the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—and the six sense objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—through the six consciousnesses and the six contacts, and then through the six feelings, six perceptions, six volitions, and six cravings, a complete chain of sensory and mental processes is constituted.

Throughout this entire process there is also the structural level of the five aggregates. The five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness—are closely tied to the six elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. The interaction of the senses and their objects, along with all the feelings, perceptions, volitions, and cravings that arise therefrom, together with the material body and the conscious mind, are woven together into all worldly experience.

III. Dependent Origination, the Arising of Suffering, Blind Darkness, and the Burning World

In the process of dependent origination and its flow, the root of feeling is contact; the root of contact is the six sense bases; and the root of the six sense bases is name-and-form (nāma-rūpa). That is, when name-and-form exist, the six sense bases arise; with the six sense bases, there is the contact constituted by sense base, object, and consciousness coming together; with contact, feeling arises. This entire sequence forms the chain of the arising of suffering.

Regarding the law of the arising and cessation of suffering, it applies universally to all combinations of the six sense bases and their corresponding external objects—whether eye and forms, ear and sounds, nose and odors, tongue and tastes, body and tangibles, or mind and mental objects. The arising of the six sense bases and six sense objects is itself the arising of suffering, illness, and old-age-and-death; the complete ceasing of the six sense bases and six sense objects is the cessation of suffering, illness, and old-age-and-death. This principle applies equally to each sense base and each object: the arising of any “base” or any “object” leads to the arising of suffering; the cessation of any “base” or any “object” leads to the cessation of suffering.

Within the concrete domain of suffering, it is especially emphasized that one must recognize that eye, forms, eye-consciousness, and eye-contact are suffering; ear, sounds, ear-consciousness, and ear-contact are suffering; nose, odors, nose-consciousness, and nose-contact are suffering; tongue, tastes, tongue-consciousness, and tongue-contact are suffering; body, tangibles, body-consciousness, and body-contact are suffering; and mind, mental objects, mind-consciousness, and mind-contact are suffering. These are the constituent factors of body-and-mind and the actual carriers in which suffering accumulates; they must be rightly known as suffering. When the six sense bases come into contact with the six sense objects, this process is often described as blind darkness, because in this process eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are called blind darkness; forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are also called blind darkness; eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness are likewise blind darkness; eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact are also blind darkness; and the pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings that arise dependent on the six kinds of contact are all blind darkness as well. This shows that blind darkness pervades the entire process from sensory cognition to the arising of feeling; every set of sense base, object, consciousness, contact, and feeling contains the same law of blind darkness.

On the other hand, all phenomena are described as being on fire. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are said to be burning; forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are burning; eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness are likewise burning; eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact are also burning; and the painful, pleasant, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings that arise from contact are all burning. This burning implies the various defilements and afflictive heats, indicating that all sense bases, their objects, consciousnesses, contacts, and feelings are without exception in a state of burning and oppression.

As to the sources of this oppression, particular emphasis is placed on the relationship between the six sense bases and the six sense objects. The eye base and visual forms, the ear base and sounds, the nose base and odors, the tongue base and tastes, the body base and tangibles, and the mind base and mental objects—all are sources of oppression. Developing revulsion (nibbidā) toward these bases and objects is one of the important fruits of contemplative practice. Once revulsion toward the six sense bases and six sense objects has arisen, one can gradually distance oneself from the oppression of suffering.

IV. Right Contemplation of Impermanence, Change, Decay, and Non-self

In contemplating all phenomena, it is especially emphasized that one must regard the six sense bases, six sense objects, six consciousnesses, and six contacts, as well as all feelings that arise from them, from the perspectives of impermanence and suffering. First, one must observe that the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—are impermanent; one must also observe that the six sense objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—are impermanent; likewise, one must observe that the six consciousnesses—eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness—are impermanent; one must also observe that the six contacts—eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact—are impermanent; and that the pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings that arise from the six contacts are also impermanent.

This contemplation of impermanence not only points out that all of these are incessantly changing; it also clarifies that all changes at the level of senses and consciousness are laws of change. The eye base, ear base, nose base, tongue base, and body base, along with their corresponding visual forms, sounds, odors, tastes, and tangibles, are all laws of change; the mind base and its corresponding mental objects are also laws of change; the consciousness that arises dependent on the contact of sense bases and objects is a law of change; and the feelings that arise dependent on contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—are likewise laws of change. The six sense bases themselves are called things subject to decay: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind all decay. The six objects are also things subject to decay: forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are all unstable. The six consciousnesses are likewise subject to decay: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness are not eternal. The six contacts are the same: eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact all decay.

On a deeper level of right view, one must recognize that the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind; the six sense objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects; as well as the six consciousnesses, six contacts, and six feelings—are all impermanent and non-self. These phenomena should not be grasped as “I” or “mine.” Through realizing their impermanence and non-self nature, ignorance can be eliminated, right view can arise, and all fetters can be cut off.

Consciousness itself also functions according to the laws of impermanence and non-self. The arising of consciousness must rely on the conjunction of sense base and object; when the conditions of base and object are completely extinguished, consciousness does not exist. The existence of consciousness is entirely dependent on the conditions from which it arises; it has no self-nature. Therefore, the essence of consciousness is non-self. Concretely, eye and forms as condition give rise to eye-consciousness; ear and sounds as condition give rise to ear-consciousness; nose and odors as condition give rise to nose-consciousness; tongue and tastes as condition give rise to tongue-consciousness; body and tangibles as condition give rise to body-consciousness; and mind and mental objects as condition give rise to mind-consciousness. All of this shows that consciousness is not an independently existent entity; it is a dependently arisen, non-self phenomenon.

In the practice of contemplating impermanence and suffering, one must also recognize that eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are suffering; forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are suffering; eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness are suffering; eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact are suffering; and one must see that any feeling which arises dependent on the six contacts—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—is also suffering. At the same time, all of these are impermanent. From the standpoint of impermanence (all phenomena are changing), the standpoint of suffering (what is impermanent is suffering), and the standpoint of non-self (that which is perishing should not be clung to as self), if one rightly contemplates eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and the feelings born of eye-contact; ear, sounds, ear-consciousness, ear-contact, and the feelings born of ear-contact; and so on up to mind, mental objects, mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and the feelings born of mind-contact, then revulsion naturally arises.

The six internal bases—that is, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—are themselves impermanent, suffering, and non-self; the causal conditions that bring about the internal six bases are likewise impermanent, suffering, and non-self. That which is produced dependent on causes and conditions that are impermanent, suffering, and non-self—namely the six internal bases—cannot possibly be permanent, pleasant, or self. Similarly, the six external bases, that is, forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects, are impermanent, suffering, and non-self; the causal conditions that produce the six external bases are also impermanent, suffering, and non-self; and that which arises dependent on causes and conditions that are impermanent, suffering, and non-self—namely the six external bases—cannot itself be permanent, pleasant, or self. When a well-instructed noble disciple contemplates in this way, he will generate revulsion toward the internal six bases and external six bases; through revulsion, he becomes dispassionate; through dispassion, he attains liberation, and realizes that there will be no further existence.

V. Craving, Sensual Desire, Delight, and the Arising of Bondage

Within the whole realm of the senses, the operation of “craving” (taṇhā) is the core of suffering and bondage. Wherever craving arises, there it lingers. It arises in and lingers upon those worldly objects that are lovable and delightful, and these objects include the six sense bases themselves—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. So long as the six sense bases and the various forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects they contact are taken to be lovable, pleasurable, delightful, and attractive, they become the objects to which craving clings.

In the domain of the senses there is an important law: if one takes delight in the senses—that is, in eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—this is equivalent to taking delight in the suffering that these senses bring; if one takes delight in the external objects—that is, in forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—this is equivalent to taking delight in the suffering that these external objects bring. Once one delights in suffering, one cannot be liberated from that very suffering. Conversely, if one does not take delight in the senses, then one does not take delight in the suffering that these senses bring; if one does not take delight in the external objects, one does not take delight in the suffering that these objects bring. Once one no longer delights in suffering, one is already liberated from that suffering.

The arising and cessation of pain and suffering are closely related to the processes of attachment and dispassion. When the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—contact delightful objects such as forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects, these objects often possess qualities that are pleasurable, lovable, delightful, and attractive. If the mind responds with joy, admiration, and clinging, attachment will arise, and from attachment suffering will arise. If, upon encountering these objects, one does not generate joy, does not praise them, and does not grow attached to them, then attachment will not form; attachment already arisen can cease, and suffering thereby will cease.

Any object known by the six sense bases, so long as it possesses delightful qualities, becomes something that can bind; and the sensual desire for these delightful objects is the actual bondage. Specifically, the colors and shapes that eye-consciousness apprehends, the sounds apprehended by ear-consciousness, the odors apprehended by nose-consciousness, the flavors apprehended by tongue-consciousness, the tactile sensations apprehended by body-consciousness, and the concepts and phenomena apprehended by mind-consciousness—so long as they bring joy to the mind—can become the roots of bondage. In the suffering and perils of worldly existence, the six sense bases are said to be empty and hollow in essence, lacking any real substance, while the six external objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—have the function of wearing down and disturbing the six sense bases.

Real bondage does not consist in the bases themselves binding the objects, nor in the objects themselves binding the bases. The eye is not the bondage of visual forms, nor are visual forms the bondage of the eye; the ear is not the bondage of sounds, nor are sounds the bondage of the ear; the nose is not the bondage of odors, nor are odors the bondage of the nose; the tongue is not the bondage of tastes, nor are tastes the bondage of the tongue; the body is not the bondage of tangibles, nor are tangibles the bondage of the body; the mind is not the bondage of mental objects, nor are mental objects the bondage of the mind. Genuine bondage is the sensual lust (kāma-rāga) that arises dependent on both sense bases and objects. When eye and forms act as condition for the arising of sensual lust, that is bondage; when ear and sounds act as condition for the arising of sensual lust, that is bondage; and similarly, the sensual lust that arises dependent on nose and odors, tongue and tastes, body and tangibles, and mind and mental objects is all bondage. This law of bondage applies equally to all sensory domains; the principle of bondage is exactly the same everywhere.

Within the domain of the five sensual pleasures, it is especially pointed out that the forms known by the eye, the sounds known by the ear, the odors known by the nose, the tastes known by the tongue, and the tangibles known by the body are the five sensual pleasures (pañca kāmaguṇā). These objects of the so-called “five strands of superior sensual pleasures” are dangerous realms from which the practitioner should keep away, because they bring craving and defilement. When the mind takes joy in these delightful colors and shapes, sounds, odors, flavors, tactile sensations, and mental images, it falls into the lures of the world and into the domain of Māra.

The ordinary person’s mind is bound because suffering arises from the six external objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—and his suffering is further deepened by his attachment to future rebirth. Māra’s bondage exists within the mental activities of “perception” and “thought.” So long as there are perceptions and thoughts, one is easily bound; if one can go beyond such perception and thought, one can be freed from Māra’s bondage.

VI. Guarding the Six Sense Bases, Not Abiding in Bases, and the Practice of Non-Deliberation

On the path to liberation, it is very important to have a clear understanding of “abiding” and “non-abiding.” “Abiding” refers to the mind’s clinging and attachment to, and bondage by, the six objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects. Once the mind abides in any of these, it is fettered by them. Conversely, “non-abiding” refers to the complete cutting off of clinging and bondage to the six objects in the case of a liberated one, so that such clinging no longer arises; hence it is called non-abiding.

In regard to guarding the six sense bases, there is a fundamental law: the difference in a practitioner’s state essentially depends on whether he can restrain and guard the six sense bases of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. If one does not restrain, guard, protect, and supervise the six bases of contact, suffering will ensue; if one skillfully restrains, guards, protects, and supervises the six bases of contact, happiness will follow. Therefore, when seeing a form with the eye, hearing a sound with the ear, smelling an odor with the nose, tasting a flavor with the tongue, touching an object with the body, or cognizing a mental object with the mind, a practitioner should not seize upon the general appearance or the particular details. If one does not guard the eye base and the mind base, unwholesome states such as lust and grief will invade the heart; conversely, if one actually practices guarding the eye base and the mind base, one can attain complete protection.

The fault of not guarding the sense doors is very evident. When seeing a form with the eye, if the mind leans toward the pleasant and turns away from the unpleasant, right mindfulness does not appear; the mind lacks careful consideration, and one cannot rightly know liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom. The unwholesome states that have arisen cannot be utterly destroyed. When hearing sounds with the ear, smelling odors with the nose, tasting flavors with the tongue, touching tangibles with the body, and cognizing mental objects with the mind, if the mind is similarly shaken by likes and dislikes, right mindfulness will be absent and consideration deficient, ultimately preventing liberating knowledge and making it difficult to cut off unwholesome states.

In contrast, guarding the sense doors is a unified and thorough practice. When the six sense bases contact their respective objects, if the mind does not incline toward pleasant objects and does not turn away from unpleasant objects, then right mindfulness will arise; the mind will dwell with limitless careful consideration. In this way one can rightly know liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and utterly extinguish any unwholesome states that arise. Under the protection of right mindfulness, the six sense bases are like six animals tethered to a firm post: although at first they each struggle and run in different directions, they eventually become tired and stop, and settle down in the same place.

In the core principle of non-deliberation, it is clearly stated that a practitioner should not think and ponder about eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind; should not think and ponder about forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects; should not think and ponder about eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness; should not think and ponder about eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact; and should not think and ponder about any feelings born of the six contacts, including pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings. One should not think about their existence, should not let thought arise because of them, and should not think of them as “mine.” This principle of non-deliberation concretely applies to the six sense bases, six objects, six consciousnesses, six contacts, and the pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings that arise dependent on contact, and it should likewise be applied to all phenomena of aggregates (khandhas), elements (dhātus), sense bases (āyatanas), and so forth. In practice, a practitioner must follow four guidelines: not thinking about the sense bases/objects/consciousnesses themselves; not thinking in terms of “having” sense bases/objects/consciousnesses; not using sense bases/objects/consciousnesses as a basis for thinking; and not thinking “sense bases/objects/consciousnesses are what I possess.” Furthermore, one should not think about eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and all feelings born thereof; nor about ear, sounds, ear-consciousness, ear-contact, and all feelings born thereof; nor about nose, odors, nose-consciousness, nose-contact, and all feelings born thereof; nor about tongue, tastes, tongue-consciousness, tongue-contact, and all feelings born thereof; nor about body, tangibles, body-consciousness, body-contact, and all feelings born thereof; nor about mind, mental objects, mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and the pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings born thereof. Indeed, one should not think about any phenomena whatsoever.

This principle of non-deliberation is emphasized as universally applicable to all six sense bases, six objects, six consciousnesses, six contacts, and all feelings that arise from them. At the same time, regarding the guarding of the six bases of contact, if when the six sense bases encounter the six objects there arise in the mind sensual desire, defiling lust, ill will, delusion, anger, and the like, one should immediately subdue them, reflecting that these mental states are terrifying, thorny, and dangerous wrong paths—paths followed by bad persons and not followed by good persons—and therefore the mind should not follow them. The uninstructed ordinary person, because he does not practice guarding the six bases of contact, indulges in the five sensual pleasures until his heart is fully satisfied. A monk who skillfully guards the six bases of contact, however, can keep his mind upright and well-established within, reaching a state of stillness, oneness, and stability.

VII. Contemplating the Six Bases, Abandoning the Non-Self, and the Path of Liberation

In the sequential practice of the path of liberation, rightly knowing and seeing the six bases is one of the explicit goals. The practitioner must rightly know and see the six bases—that is, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—and give rise to revulsion toward the six bases, abandon sensual desire, and thereby gain liberation. Concretely, the essential contemplations include first the observation of the six internal bases together with the corresponding six external objects: the eye-base and visual forms, the ear-base and sounds, the nose-base and odors, the tongue-base and tastes, the body-base and tangibles, and the mind-base and mental objects. The practitioner must rightly know and see the law of the accumulation of the six bases, rightly know and see the law of the cessation of the six bases, and rightly know and see the entire process of the accumulation and cessation of the six bases.

After the accomplishment of practice, one of the standards for verifying the accomplishment of wisdom is the ability to know the conditions for the arising of the six bases, to know the conditions for the cessation of the six bases, and to know fully the arising and ceasing of the six bases. In the shared definition held by the wise and by all the noble ones, true accomplishment consists in rightly knowing and seeing the arising, passing away, sweetness, peril, and escape with regard to the six bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Such right knowledge and vision are regarded as the fundamental cognitive basis of liberation and the core foundation of practice.

As for concrete abandonment, it is first pointed out that the six sense bases, six sense objects, six consciousnesses, six contacts, and the feelings that arise from them are all objects that should be abandoned. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind ought to be abandoned; eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness ought to be abandoned; eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact ought to be abandoned; and any feeling that arises dependent on these contacts—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—ought to be abandoned. Going further, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not truly one’s own possessions and should be relinquished; forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are not one’s own possessions and should be relinquished; eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness are not one’s own possessions and should be relinquished; eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact are likewise not one’s own possessions and should be relinquished; and the feelings that arise dependent on these contacts—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—are not one’s own possessions and should be relinquished. Abandoning all phenomena that are not-self and not-mine in this way is the fundamental means of obtaining benefit and happiness. This is emphasized as a principle universally applicable to all six sense bases, six objects, six consciousnesses, six contacts, and all feelings arising from them.

In the teaching of non-abiding in internal and external bases, it is once again stressed that the internal six bases and external six objects are not things that a practitioner can truly possess. The internal six bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—should be relinquished; those who relinquish them attain benefit and happiness. The external six objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—should likewise be relinquished; those who relinquish them also gain benefit and happiness. When a well-instructed noble disciple contemplates that both internal and external six bases are impermanent, suffering, and non-self, and knows that their causal conditions are likewise impermanent, suffering, and non-self, he naturally becomes disenchanted with them; through disenchantment he becomes dispassionate, through dispassion he is liberated, and finally he realizes that there will be no further rebirth.

In order to advance toward Nibbāna, there is also a specific set of criteria and contemplative methods. A practitioner should examine the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind; examine forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects; examine eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness; and examine eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact; and he should examine the pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings that arise dependent on the six contacts. All these must be seen as impermanent and as suffering. One must see that eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are impermanent and are suffering; that forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects are impermanent and are suffering; that the six consciousnesses are impermanent and are suffering; that the six contacts are impermanent and are suffering; and that all feelings arising from the six contacts—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—are impermanent and suffering. By such contemplation, the practitioner can penetrate the core law of Nibbāna.

VIII. Summary of the World, Names and Concepts, and the Various Elements

In regard to the constitution of all phenomena, they are often summarized as six pairs of base-and-object: eye and forms, ear and sounds, nose and odors, tongue and tastes, body and tangibles, and mind and mental objects. These pairs are used to explain all worldly names and concepts. When the eye base, form object, eye-consciousness, and the phenomena known by eye-consciousness are present, the name and concept “Māra” can exist; when the ear base, sound object, ear-consciousness, and the phenomena known by ear-consciousness are present, the name and concept “Māra” can exist; when nose, odors, nose-consciousness, and the phenomena known by nose-consciousness are present; when tongue, tastes, tongue-consciousness, and the phenomena known by tongue-consciousness are present; when body, tangibles, body-consciousness, and the phenomena known by body-consciousness are present; and when mind, mental objects, mind-consciousness, and the phenomena known by mind-consciousness are present, then the name and concept “Māra” can equally exist. Conversely, when each set of sense base, object, consciousness, and its known phenomena ceases, the name and concept “Māra” likewise ceases. This law governing the arising and ceasing of names and concepts applies universally to the existence and cessation of all names and concepts such as “Māra,” “sentient being,” “suffering,” and “world.”

In a broader definition of “world,” the world, as conceived by the ordinary person, is the cognition produced dependent on the six sense bases. The domain of the six sense bases is likened to an “ocean.” In the teachings of the Noble Ones, a person’s six sense faculties are called an “ocean,” and the six objects—forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—are described as the rapids and torrents in that ocean. This ocean constituted by the six sense bases has waves and whirlpools; it is the abode of ghosts and rākṣasas (demons). To cross over this dangerous great ocean one must be able to withstand and endure the torrents of desire generated by the six objects. At the same time, the six sense bases and their objects can also be described as this shore and the other shore: the six internal sense capacities are this shore, and the six external objects are the other shore.

In the simile of the city and its streets, the six internal bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—are likened to the six gates of a capital city, while the four material great elements of earth, water, fire, and air are likened to the four intersecting streets at the center of the city. When realizing purified vision, one must rightly observe the arising and cessation of the six bases of contact, and must also rightly observe the arising and cessation of the four great elements. The four great elements are likened to poisonous snakes, extremely dangerous and posing a direct threat to life; the six sense bases are essentially hollow, and the six objects wear down and damage the six bases. These similes echo one another, illustrating that body-and-mind and the external environment are all unreliable and insecure.

Regarding the classification of roots or faculties, the eye faculty, ear faculty, nose faculty, tongue faculty, body faculty, and mind faculty are clearly pointed out as the six faculties. Among them, the five faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body each have their own specific objects of perception and spheres of operation; they cannot receive or substitute for the functions of other faculties. In the processes of change of the faculties, the functions of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body faculties all undergo alteration, showing that all bases, objects, consciousnesses, and contacts are themselves unstable, decaying phenomena.

Finally, regarding the difference between non-Buddhist systems and the Buddha in their treatment of the six sense bases, it is specifically pointed out that non-Buddhist ascetics generate “self-view” regarding the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—clinging to them as “this is what I possess,” “this is me,” or “this is my true self”; the Buddha, however, does not generate self-view regarding the six sense bases, does not cling to them as “this is what I possess,” “this is me,” or “this is my true self.” Under such right view, the right knowledge and vision of the six sense bases, six objects, six consciousnesses, six contacts, and all feelings, perceptions, volitions, and cravings, together with the contemplation of their impermanence, suffering, and non-self, become the fundamental path for renouncing sensual desire, cutting off craving, transcending the world, and realizing Nibbāna.
