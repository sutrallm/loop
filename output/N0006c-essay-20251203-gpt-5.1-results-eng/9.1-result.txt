<title> A Comprehensive Treatise on the Law of Dependent Origination, the Realms of Sentient Beings, and the Path of Liberation </title>

<article>
I. Suffering, Samsara, and the Fundamental Afflictions  

I.1 The Three Poisons as the Root of All Distress  
All disadvantages, sufferings, and unease that revolve within the world arise most fundamentally from three unwholesome states: greed, hatred, and delusion. Greed drives sentient beings to ceaselessly chase what they desire; hatred gives rise to resentment and harm; delusion leaves people confused about the truth. Once these three poisons arise in the world, they become the ultimate root of all pain and all unwholesome results.

I.2 The Law of Dependent Origination and the Twelve Links of Cyclic Existence  
Seen in the light of right view, no phenomenon arises without conditions, nor does anything arise from itself, from another, or from both; it arises only in dependence on preceding conditions. Any phenomenon requires preceding causes and conditions to appear; therefore it is said, “With this existing, that comes to be; with this arising, that arises.”  

In the concrete unfolding of dependent origination, we can observe the sequence of cyclic existence: because ignorance exists, volitional formations are produced; because formations exist, consciousness arises; because consciousness exists, name-and-form is established; because name-and-form exists, the six sense bases are complete; because the six sense bases exist, contact occurs; because contact exists, feeling arises; because feeling exists, craving arises; because craving exists, clinging arises; because clinging exists, becoming arises; because becoming exists, birth arises; because birth exists, it inevitably leads to old age and death, together with all the resulting mass of suffering. From this we see that once ignorance is activated, it drives the entire chain of samsaric links until the aggregates of suffering are fully established.

I.3 The Mutual Dependence, Aggregation, and Universal Law of Name-and-Form and Consciousness  
Among these twelve links of dependent origination, the relationship between name-and-form and consciousness is extremely close: they are mutual conditions for one another and mutually support each other. Only in dependence on name-and-form can consciousness be established; only in dependence on consciousness can name-and-form be accomplished. They are like two bundles of reeds leaning on each other: if either side is removed, the whole cannot stand.  

If name-and-form ceases, consciousness also ceases; if consciousness ceases, name-and-form likewise no longer stands. Following this principle backward, the cessation of each preceding link leads to the cessation of the subsequent links, ultimately leading to the cessation of the entire mass of suffering. This law of mutual dependence between earlier and later factors holds not only now, but exactly so in past lives and exactly so in future lives, without exception throughout the three times.  

In the same way, the aggregation and formation of sentient beings operates according to certain laws of aggregation. This law of aggregation likewise applies universally to all times and never fails because of changes in era.

I.4 The Modes of Samsaric Wandering and the Descent into Woeful Realms  
Sentient beings wander back and forth in the cycle of birth and death like a stick thrown up into the air: when it falls to the ground, it may land on the root end, on the middle, or on the tip—there is nothing fixed or unchanging. Beings may go from this world to that world, and from that world return to this one, coming and going like this without end.  

Driven by unwholesome states like greed, hatred, and delusion, and further blinded by ignorance of the true nature of dependent origination, most beings ultimately find it hard to escape the woeful realms. Thus, among all sentient beings, the number who fall into bad destinies is exceedingly vast, while those who are able to gain liberation and escape are exceedingly few—like the very small number of survivors in a great catastrophe.

II. Mind, Aggregation, and the Pursuits of Sentient Beings  

II.1 Beings Gather According to Affinities of Mind  
All sentient beings are linked to and in accord with the distinctive qualities of their own minds. Those whose mental tendencies are similar naturally attract each other and coexist, forming a fundamental law of affinity. Those lacking a sense of shame and moral dread gather with others who likewise lack shame; those who are of little learning and seldom hear the teachings gather with others who are similarly limited; those with distorted wisdom dwell among others of distorted wisdom.  

Conversely, those with a sense of shame associate with others who possess shame; the much‑learned associate with the much‑learned; those endowed with wisdom and able to skillfully maintain it likewise take as companions others who preserve wisdom. This principle of gathering according to affinity of mind holds not only in the present life, but also in past and future lives: it runs consistently through the three times and has never been interrupted.

II.2 The Universal Manner in Which Beings Seek Fulfillment  
Within this mental framework, all beings, according to their own conditions, needs, and inclinations, seek the various objects and resources they require. Their pursuit of fulfillment is like people using various delicious side dishes to go with rice, so that each person can feel full and delighted according to their own taste.  

As long as they are driven by desire, beings will tirelessly strive to pursue what they believe can bring them happiness and satisfaction. This striving and pursuit of fulfillment is a law that universally applies to all sentient beings; it is not limited to a single clan or a single kind of creature.

II.3 Mental Activities Triggered by Contact and Their Blind, Obscured Nature  
When the six sense bases are complete and dependent origination is in motion, contact arises from the meeting of sense bases and their objects. From contact, many mental activities further arise, including the arising of feeling, conceptual thought about the object, and consciousness that knows and discriminates the object.  

These mental activities seem manifold and ever‑changing, yet they all share the same characteristics of agitation, dissolution, impermanence, decay, and transformation; none of them is stable and unchanging. Taken as a whole, the nature of all phenomena of existence is a kind of “blind obscurity.” This “blind obscurity” means that these phenomena in themselves lead to bondage and suffering and are closely linked with the processes of birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, making it hard for sentient beings to escape.

II.4 The Faults of Ordinary Beings and the Loss of Mindfulness  
Under such conditions, among ordinary beings there is almost no one who is completely without wrongdoing, no one entirely free of faults, and no one who never loses mindfulness. Because they frequently lose right mindfulness and are deluded by momentary desire or anger, they commit many unwholesome actions in body and speech, thereby further reinforcing the bonds of samsara. These faults are not rare exceptions limited to a few individuals; they are the common condition of ordinary beings.

III. Impermanence, Aging, and Worldly Splendor  

III.1 The Impermanence and Instability of All Conditioned Phenomena  
Whatever conditioned phenomena arise from the coming together of causes and conditions are without exception impermanent, and none are firm or truly secure. They are constantly changing within arising and ceasing, vanishing in an instant. External conditions are like this, and the body‑mind is likewise. This nature of impermanence, instability, and lack of security pervades all fabricated phenomena.

III.2 The Concrete Manifestation of Aging in the Body  
For an individual life, aging leaves clear marks on the body. As the years increase, the complexion gradually loses the purity and brightness of youth, becoming dull and without luster; the hands and feet become slack and weak, no longer nimble; the skin of the body shows wrinkles one after another, the muscles loosen, and it becomes difficult to maintain the firmness of earlier days; the whole figure gradually bends forward and can no longer stand as straight as before. These subtle yet evident changes all declare the inevitability of impermanence and aging.

III.3 The Grandeur of Worldly Glory and the Limits of Actual Enjoyment  
There have been people who possessed exceedingly great worldly splendor, for example: eighty‑four thousand cities, palaces, and pavilions; countless jewelled beds; troops of elephants, horses, and chariots; innumerable jewels; and retinues of consorts, many ministers, countless dairy cattle, elegant garments, and vessels for food and drink. In terms of quantity and scale, such wealth can be said to surpass all around.  

However, what can actually be enjoyed is very limited. Among so many cities, the person actually lives only in one; among so many palaces, he resides only in a single hall; among countless treasures, he can use at one time only a few items; among boundless provisions, he in fact takes only the basic necessities to sustain life. From this we see that even when one possesses immense resources and glory, the portion that is truly used and enjoyed remains extremely small, and in the end it cannot transcend the nature of impermanence and insufficiency.

III.4 The Incalculable Number of Ganges Sands and the Measureless Waters of the Ocean  
Some things in the world are so vast and profound that they cannot be accurately measured. For instance, no one can compute the exact number of grains of sand in the Ganges River, nor can they precisely quantify them in units of hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands. Similarly, no one can accurately measure the volume of water in the ocean by pecks, bushels, or other units, for the vastness and depth of the sea exceed the ordinary range of measurement and become something immeasurable. This incalculability and immeasurability also remind people not to underestimate the vastness and impermanence of the world.

III.5 Painful Feeling Compared to the Peril of a Precipice  
When describing painful bodily sensations, the image of a “steep cliff” is often used. A precipitous cliff is a sheer and dangerous place where a slight misstep may lead to a fatal fall, symbolizing how bodily pain is both pressing and hard to escape. This metaphor illustrates that bodily pain is like standing on the edge of a cliff, filled with danger and insecurity; with the slightest carelessness one may fall into a situation that is unbearable.

IV. Worldly Views, Religious Rituals, and the True Meaning of Purity  

IV.1 Traditional Views of Water‑Purification and Their Actual Limitations  
In certain traditional views, people believe that if they bathe in water morning and evening, they can wash away all the evil deeds committed by day and by night, and further regard physical cleanliness as the basic method for purifying karma. In reality, however, water can only wash away dirt from the surface of the body; it cannot purify the deep‑rooted afflictions of greed, hatred, and delusion within, nor can it eliminate the inevitable results of evil actions done in the past. Such water‑purification practices provide only an external sense of cleanliness and offer little real help for the genuine purification of mental conduct and karmic results.

IV.2 Fire‑Worship Rituals and Modes of Offering  
Another popular religious practice is to perform offerings through fire rituals. Participants light a fire and conduct a fire‑offering ceremony, cooking milk‑rice as an offering to the fire. This method is considered an important form of sacrifice and offering, in which respect and petition are expressed by casting the milk‑rice into the flames. Yet such practices mostly focus on outward ritual and do not necessarily reach the true transformation of inner greed, hatred, and delusion.

IV.3 The Fundamental Law of Purity and Attainment  
From a deeper perspective, all sentient beings possess the possibility of practice; it is not confined to particular castes, classes, or identities. Purity and attainment in practice bear no necessary connection to one’s birth or social background. The gate of practice is equally open to all; any person who is willing to act in accordance with the teaching has the potential to attain purity. This fundamental law of purity breaks through worldly attachment to high and low status.

IV.4 The Error of Abandoning the Fundamental Twofold Path and Proclaiming Another  
When facing the path of liberation, if someone proposes to abandon two fundamental and important methods, yet claims to expound some other two methods to replace them, such talk is mere emptiness. When others question him further and demand an explanation of the content and basis of his teaching, he cannot respond satisfactorily, thereby revealing the instability of his doctrine, and he finally falls into confusion and bewilderment. Such abandonment of what is fundamental in favor of the trivial cannot lead to liberation and instead causes greater confusion at the level of views.

IV.5 Unanswered Questions and Their Fundamental Reason  
Concerning certain views—such as a particular set of four views—the Blessed One does not answer them. The fundamental reason lies in beings’ attachment to the five aggregates. Because beings dwell in and cling to form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, and take them up with craving and attachment, then on this basis, any further discussion of certain subtle views would only intensify clinging and would not help liberation.  

More specifically, regarding all those questions that revolve around whether there is or is not freedom from craving, since craving has not yet been relinquished and attachment has not ceased, the Tathāgata does not answer them; this is the root reason and condition why these questions remain unanswered. Related to this are two types of questions about the relation between “life principle” and “body,” such as: “Is the life principle identical with the body?” or “Is the life principle different from the body?” These too fall into the category of unanswered questions, because as long as one has not transcended attachment to the five aggregates and to one’s own body and mind, becoming entangled in such questions cannot bring any substantial benefit for liberation.

V. Conventional Designation and Reflection on Worldly Cognition  

V.1 The Constituent Elements and Conditions for the Existence of a Verse  
On the level of language and literature, for a verse to exist, several requirements are all indispensable. Meter is the fundamental cause by which a verse is formed; without rhythm and rhyme, it can hardly be a true verse. Written characters are the sign of the verse: through the arrangement of concrete words, the verse can be seen and transmitted. A title provides a basis for the verse, enabling it to be known by a particular theme or name. The poet himself can be called the “dwelling place” of the verse, for without the creator’s mind and interpretation, the verse could not arise or be established. Only when these conditions come together does a verse come to exist as a literary reality.

V.2 Worldly Signs and Conventional Designation  
In worldly speech, people use certain obvious symbols as signs by which to recognize things. For example, a banner or flag erected on a cart becomes the sign of a cart: seeing the flag, people know a cart is there. Smoke rising from afar is taken as the sign that there is fire: seeing smoke, people know there is fire. A king symbolizes the center and authority of a realm and thus becomes the sign of a kingdom. A husband is regarded as the sign of a woman, because through the husband people recognize the woman’s marital status.  

Although these signs are established by worldly convention, they have become deeply rooted in people’s minds and constitute a shared system of symbols acknowledged in the world.

V.3 Three Modes of Speech and the Designation of the Five Aggregates across the Three Times  
In the use of language and the conventional designation of names, there is a set of three modes of speech and conceptual reference: “has been,” “is,” and “will be.” These three have never been confused since ancient times—so it is in the past, present, and future—and they are not criticized by those who are wise practitioners.  

Specifically, for the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—that belonged to the past and have already ceased and perished, only designations and expressions of “has been” may be applied; they cannot be said to “exist now,” nor can they be called “will be.” For future aggregates that have not yet arisen, only designations and expressions of “will be” may be used; they cannot be said to “exist now,” nor can they be called “have been.” For present aggregates that have already arisen and presently exist, only designations and expressions of “is” may be applied; they cannot be described as “has been” or “will be.”  

These conventions of language prevent us, when speaking of existence across the three times, from confusing temporal order and factual situation. However, some who hold doctrines of no‑cause, no‑action, or nihilism, out of their own bias, criticize these three modes of expression and deny their legitimacy. They do so because they fear ridicule, contempt, and blame from others, and so attempt to cover their unease with inverted discourse, yet in fact only expose their own lack of correct understanding of these laws.

V.4 The Worldly “Sea” and Its True Meaning in the Holy Teaching  
In the language of ordinary beings, the word “sea” merely refers to a vast mass of water; seeing an immense body of water, they call it a sea. In the teaching of the noble ones, however, such a “sea” is not the true sea of concern; it is only a great aggregation of material water.  

According to the holy teaching, what is truly meaningful as a “sea” does not point to external water, but to the various objects apprehended through the six sense faculties. These sense objects possess features that are pleasant, lovable, delightful, and joyful, and precisely these features continually arouse and increase the desires and cravings of beings, causing them to indulge and drown in them.  

In fact, not only humans, but also beings in the heavenly realms, the realm of Māra, and the Brahmā realms, as well as ascetics, brahmins, gods, and worldly people—most of them are immersed in this “sea of the six sense objects.” Their state of immersion is like tangled threads knotted into a lump—extremely difficult to untie; like a wrapped tumor that cannot be opened to gain relief; or like the creepers called muñja grass and balbaja grass, which are so intertwined that the more they are entangled, the harder they are to separate.  

Because they are deeply immersed in this sea of the six sense objects, beings cannot transcend the bondage it creates, and thus they cannot leave those painful places that ought to be abandoned. In the end they even fall into woeful realms and extreme suffering, continuing to revolve in the cycle of birth and death without attaining release.

VI. Light, Glory, and the Truly Supreme Radiance  

VI.1 Various Symbols of Radiance in the World  
In the eyes of worldly people, different entities each display their own kind of radiance. The sun shines in the daytime, illuminating heaven and earth, and is taken as the symbol of the light of day. The moon shines at night, dispelling darkness, and is seen as the symbol of nocturnal light. The kshatriya, clad in armor, whose mail glitters, is regarded as a symbol of the glory of power and might. The brahmin, dwelling in meditative absorption, whose deep and tranquil states inspire respect, is likewise regarded as possessing a kind of radiant splendor. Though these radiances are different, together they shape the worldly imagination of honor and nobility.

VI.2 Four Forms of Light and the Supreme Light of Perfect Awakening  
Viewed more broadly, one can speak of four kinds of light in the world. First is the daylight of the sun, which illuminates the world and makes all things manifest. Second is the moonlight of the night, which brings a gentle brightness to the darkness. Third is the light of fire that burns by day and by night, providing warmth and illumination. Fourth is the unsurpassed light of perfect awakening.  

The first three kinds of light can dispel the darkness visible to the physical eye, yet they can function only within limited scope. Only the unsurpassed light of perfect awakening can dispel the deep darkness of ignorance, pointing out to beings the path to ultimate liberation; therefore it is regarded as the most excellent of the four kinds of light.

VI.3 The Value Contrast between Fourfold Attainment in the Dharma and Worldly Sovereignty  
When we compare worldly attainments with attainment in the Dharma, there is a clear contrast: even to obtain the great power to rule over the four continents is, in value, not equal to even one‑sixteenth of the attainment of a certain fourfold Dharma accomplishment. Worldly sovereignty seems enormous, yet it is still constrained by impermanence and decay. The significance of that fourfold attainment on the path of liberation far surpasses all worldly power and cannot be measured by worldly standards at all.

VII. Dependent Origination, the Four Noble Truths, Liberation, and Supernormal Powers  

VII.1 Dependent Origination as the Common Ground of All Perfectly Enlightened Ones  
All perfectly enlightened ones attain unsurpassed awakening not because their minds communicate with each other directly, but because they all thoroughly understand the classifications of the Dharma and the orderly sequence of the laws. Once one penetrates these essentials of the Dharma, one understands that the content realized by all perfectly enlightened ones of the past, present, and future is without difference.  

These laws possess universal applicability: all perfectly enlightened ones, whether in the past, present, or future, realize awakening by relying on the same laws, and not by inventing different paths of awakening for themselves.

VII.2 The Distinction between Liberating Wisdom and Supernormal Powers  
In practice and attainment, genuine liberating wisdom is not necessarily accompanied by many supernormal powers. A person might enjoy various psychic transformations: with the divine ear he might hear all sounds near and far; with mind‑reading he might know the thoughts of others; he might recollect many former lives and remember his past courses of birth and death; with the divine eye he might see beings wandering in birth and death according to their karma; he might even, with his body, directly realize the peaceful liberation that transcends both form and the formless.  

Yet, although these abilities are marvelous, they do not necessarily coincide with ultimate liberation. True liberating wisdom is not based on whether one possesses psychic powers.

VII.3 The Difference between a Perfectly Enlightened One and a Wisdom‑Liberated Monk  
Among those who have already attained liberation, there is also a difference between a perfectly enlightened one and a monk who is liberated by wisdom. Both have realized liberation, yet the ability to independently discover and teach the path of liberation so that other beings may follow it to liberation is uniquely possessed by the perfectly enlightened one; it is not within the reach of an ordinary wisdom‑liberated monk. This capacity for opening up and teaching the path is the chief distinction between them.

VII.4 The Four Noble Truths and the Difficulty of Fully Penetrating Them  
In the teaching of liberation, the truths concerning suffering and liberation are summarized as the Four Noble Truths. First is the Noble Truth of Suffering, which states that all conditioned existence subject to defilement is, in its very nature, suffering. Second is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, which points out that suffering arises because of the causes accumulated by craving and the like. Third is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, which explains that suffering can be brought to an end: when its originating causes are cut off, suffering ceases accordingly. Fourth is the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, which points out the path of practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.  

To truly penetrate these Four Noble Truths is not easy. Even if someone is extraordinarily skilled, able to shoot the butt of an arrow through an extremely small keyhole from afar, and each arrow follows the previous one without the slightest error—although such skill is astonishing, it is still not the hardest thing to accomplish. In comparison, truly understanding and realizing the Four Noble Truths is the most difficult and most sublime attainment.

VII.5 The Time Limit and Portents of Final Nirvana  
When the Tathāgata relinquishes his life span and enters final nirvana (parinirvāṇa), extraordinary signs appear in the world, such as great earthquakes, as exceptionally solemn and special portents. Moreover, the time of final nirvana can be clearly determined—for instance, there was the decision to enter final nirvana three months hence—showing that the Tathāgata has clear and sovereign mastery over his own life span and the timing of nirvana.

VIII. Types of Beings, Modes of Birth, and the Law of Elevation  

VIII.1 Dragon Birth Types and Their Order of Superiority  
Among the nāgas (dragons), there are four modes of birth: egg‑born, womb‑born, moisture‑born, and spontaneously born (apparitional). These four modes of birth are also ranked in superiority and inferiority. In terms of status and excellence, the spontaneously born dragon is the most exalted; next comes the moisture‑born; then the womb‑born; while the egg‑born dragon occupies the lowest position. Though all are of the dragon kind, due to differences in birth type, the abilities and states they possess also differ accordingly.

VIII.2 The Life Forms of the Garuḍa Birds and the Law Governing Their Predation on Dragons  
In contrast to the dragon kind, the golden‑winged garuḍa birds also have their own life forms, likewise divided into egg‑born, womb‑born, moisture‑born, and spontaneously born. The kinds of dragons a garuḍa can seize and devour vary according to the “higher” level of its birth form.  

An egg‑born garuḍa can seize only egg‑born dragons and cannot prey on other types. A womb‑born garuḍa can seize both egg‑born and womb‑born dragons. A moisture‑born garuḍa has greater capacity: it can seize egg‑born, womb‑born, and moisture‑born dragons. As for a spontaneously born garuḍa, it can seize all four types of dragons—egg‑born, womb‑born, moisture‑born, and spontaneously born—leaving almost no place of escape for the dragons. This pattern of predation clearly shows that as life‑form level rises, power and range of influence expand correspondingly.

VIII.3 The Universality of the Law of Elevating Life States among Dragons  
Within the world of dragons, there exists a law concerning the elevation of one’s state of life. This law does not apply only to one type of dragon but applies universally to egg‑born, womb‑born, moisture‑born, and spontaneously born dragons alike. Regardless of birth mode, as long as they act in accordance with this law, they all have the possibility of elevating their state of life. This shows that even within the life forms of the dragon kind, there is a path that transcends original limitations and leads toward a higher state.

IX. Holy Ones, Supernormal Powers, and the Manifestation of Karma  

IX.1 The Situation and Choice of Morally Disciplined Holy Ones in Time of War  
There was once a group of holy ones, pure in precepts and endowed with fine virtues, who lived by the seashore in small huts made of wood and leaves. During that period, a fierce war broke out between the gods and the asuras. These holy ones pondered deeply and judged that the gods were acting in accord with the true Dharma, while the asura hosts were not. Because the asuras did not abide by the true Dharma, the holy ones felt fear of them.  

To dispel this fear, they decided to go before the asura king Sambara and beg him to grant them fearlessness, hoping thereby to obtain safety.

IX.2 The Refusal of Their Plea and the Asura King’s Reason  
These holy ones did not go in an ordinary way, but used supernormal power to appear before the asura king in an instant and directly raise their request, asking him to grant them fearlessness and do them no harm. However, the asura king did not comply; instead, he clearly declared that he would give only fear, not fearlessness.  

The reason he refused was that he regarded these holy ones as serving the Lord of the Gods, Śakra—who was his enemy. From this stance of enmity, he was unwilling to grant safety and protection to the holy ones.

IX.3 The Holy Ones’ Curse, Their Return, and the Verification of Karmic Fruits  
After being refused by the asura king, the morally disciplined holy ones pronounced a curse upon him, wishing that he should himself suffer the consequences of evil. Then again they used their supernormal power and in a very short time returned to their huts by the sea.  

After the curse was uttered, the karmic result did not take long to appear. That same night the asura king was attacked three times in succession and awakened in terror, deeply afflicted by fear. This rapid response served as a clear verification of the swift manifestation of the law of karma, showing that once evil karma ripens, its fruit follows like a shadow.

IX.4 The Outcome of a Demon’s Failed Harassment  
In another situation, a demon once tried to cause harm and disturbance, but being unable to achieve his aim, he became thoroughly disheartened and finally had to give up all attempts at harassment and depart in silence. This failed outcome shows that in the presence of true Dharma and right mindfulness, malice and disturbance do not always succeed.

X. The Classification of Faculties and the Stream of Life  

X.1 The Definition of Faculties and Their Sixfold Classification  
In exploring the constitution of life and body, we may speak of the concept of “faculties” or “roots” (indriya). According to their nature and function, these can be divided into several types. Although one may speak of a threefold classification of faculties, in fact it encompasses six functionally distinct faculties: the female faculty, the male faculty, the life faculty, the faculty of the unknown‑to‑be‑known, the faculty of the known, and the faculty of the fully‑known. These faculties support the functioning of life and cognition on different levels.

X.2 The Fundamental Status of the Female, Male, and Life Faculties  
Among these six faculties, the female and male faculties form the physiological basis for female and male bodies respectively, determining their sex characteristics and associated bodily functions. The life faculty sustains the continuity of life and is the fundamental support by which beings are able to live and act. Without the life faculty, the activity of life could not unfold; the gender faculties allow beings to manifest the differing appearances and roles of male and female.

X.3 The Levels of the Unknown‑to‑be‑Known, Known, and Fully‑Known Faculties  
Apart from the faculties directly related to body and life, there are three faculties connected with cognitive levels. The faculty of the unknown‑to‑be‑known refers to what is not yet understood but ought to be understood; it reminds practitioners that much remains to be learned and perfected. The faculty of the known signifies that understanding and knowledge have arisen regarding certain phenomena. The faculty of the fully‑known means that knowledge has been completely fulfilled and one is able to grasp with complete wisdom all that should be known.  

In the course of practice, beings go from the unknown, gradually into the known, and further to the fully‑known. These three cognitive faculties together constitute the process of the growth of wisdom.

XI. Contact, Feeling, and Emptiness  

XI.1 Feelings and Mental Activities Arising from Contact  
When the six faculties come into contact with the six objects, contact arises. What follows is not merely a simple experience of contact: it also triggers a series of mental activities within. From contact arise feelings that may be painful, pleasant, or neither‑painful‑nor‑pleasant. On this basis, thought, judgment, and discrimination about the object arise, and further, consciousness is formed, incorporating the experience into the framework of cognition.  

Yet these feelings, thoughts, and cognitions are not stable or unchanging existents; at every moment they are in a state of agitation, dissolution, impermanence, decay, and transformation, never abiding even for an instant.

XI.2 The Emptiness and Non‑Self of All Elements and Experiences  
Whether it is the sense faculties themselves, the various objects they contact, or the resulting discrimination, contact, and feeling—fundamentally, all these can be said to be “empty.” Emptiness here means that there is no independent, permanent, unchanging “self” or “what belongs to a self” within them. All phenomena are merely temporary manifestations arising through the aggregation of conditions; as conditions change, new configurations immediately unfold. Precisely because of this, to cling to any part of this process as a real self can only lead to deeper confusion.

XI.3 The Blind Nature of Existential Phenomena and Their Link to Suffering  
From a broader viewpoint, the essence of all existential phenomena can be called blind obscurity. This does not mean total darkness, but rather that they lead to bondage and throw sentient beings into suffering. These phenomena are tightly interwoven with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, each mutually conditioning the others. As long as beings revolve within this net of blind phenomena, they cannot truly break free from the bonds of suffering.

XII. The Formation of Wrong Views, Worldly Glory, and the Equality of Purity  

XII.1 The Impermanence of the Five Aggregates and the Mechanism by Which Wrong Views Arise  
The five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—are in their nature impermanent and suffering. If one clings to them with attachment and desire, one mistakenly regards what is in constant flux as something permanent and unchanging, thereby giving rise to various wrong views such as “phenomena are eternal” or “after death there is an unchanging self.”  

Conversely, if one can see that the five aggregates are merely conditioned, composite phenomena, and no longer clings to them with attachment and craving, then such wrong views obsessed with permanence and self will not arise. One thus gains the possibility of moving toward right view and liberation.

XII.2 The Equality of Opportunities for Purity and Liberation  
Regarding purity and liberation, there is no privilege based on birth or status. All sentient beings can practice; no one is excluded because of caste, class, or social position. Purity and attainment in practice have no direct connection with bloodline, occupation, or worldly titles; rather, they depend on whether one truly follows the teaching in practice. The gate of practice is equally open to everyone, and the opportunity for pure attainment is offered on an equal basis.

XIII. Worldly Names, Metaphors for Suffering, and the Retreat of Demons  

XIII.1 Reconsidering the Difference between “Sea” and “Great Mass of Water”  
As mentioned earlier, the “sea” spoken of by ordinary people, in the eyes of the holy ones, is nothing more than a great mass of water, and is not the true object of concern in the teaching of liberation. What the holy teaching calls “sea” is actually the world of the various sense objects of the six faculties—objects that are pleasing, delightful, and joyful. By their seductive qualities they lead and strengthen the desires of beings and deepen craving. This “sea of the six sense objects” is a crucial factor that perpetuates ceaseless samsara and the fall into woeful destinies.

XIII.2 Bodily Suffering as a Precipice and the Withdrawal of Demons  
Among experiences of suffering, bodily painful feeling is likened to a steep precipice, in order to show its pressing and perilous nature. At the same time, although many demons and obstacles attempt to disturb the true Dharma and practitioners, they do not always succeed. There has been a demon who, unable to accomplish his attempt at harassment, in the end could only feel frustrated and disheartened and quietly depart. On one hand, this shows the fragility of malice; on the other, it illustrates that if one can abide in the true Dharma and right mindfulness, many disturbances and obstacles will prove ineffective and retreat.

XIV. Worldly Skills, Common Speech, and the Difficulty of the Four Noble Truths  

XIV.1 The Limitations of Even the Most Skillful Worldly Arts  
As previously illustrated, there may be someone so highly skilled that he can shoot the butt of an arrow through an extremely small keyhole from a great distance, with each shot following the previous one without deviation. Such expertise is indeed extraordinary and astonishing; yet compared with truly penetrating the Four Noble Truths, it is still not the most difficult accomplishment. However exquisite a worldly art may be, it remains within the sphere of conditioned impermanence, whereas full realization of the Four Noble Truths concerns the great matter of liberation from birth and death.

XIV.2 Once More Contrasting Worldly and Sacred Uses of the Word “Sea”  
What ordinary people call “sea” is merely the collective term for an immense body of water; in the holy teaching, such is seen only as a “great mass of water,” a material phenomenon. The “sea” to which the holy teaching truly refers is the sea of craving formed by the six sense objects. Distinguishing these two meanings of “sea” helps us understand that not all worldly terms can be carried unchanged into the perspective of the holy teaching; their meanings must be clarified and redefined.

XV. Conclusion: From the Three Poisons to the Path of Liberation  

XV.1 The Overall Pattern of the Three Poisons, Dependent Origination, and Samsara  
Reviewing all the foregoing, we can see that the three unwholesome states—greed, hatred, and delusion—are the fundamental causes that drive the process of dependent origination and give rise to all disadvantages, sufferings, and unease. Because of ignorance, beings create volitional formations; because of formations, consciousness; and so on, leading up to birth, aging, death, and the arising of the entire mass of suffering.  

Furthermore, based on attachment to the five aggregates, beings take what is impermanent as permanent and accordingly generate various wrong views and false doctrines, unable to truly see the emptiness and non‑self of all phenomena. Thus they become deeply entangled in the allure of the sea of the six sense objects and find it difficult to escape the ocean of samsaric suffering.

XV.2 The Universality of the Laws and the Feasibility of Liberation  
Yet all perfectly enlightened ones demonstrate that these laws of conditions and interrelations are constant in the past, present, and future and can indeed be known and practiced. All beings have the potential for practice, regardless of their birth or social identity. As long as they are willing to relinquish attachment to the five aggregates, realize that all conditioned things are impermanent and all phenomena are without self, and follow the Four Noble Truths step by step, they can move from the torrent of descent into woeful destinies toward liberation.  

Although penetrating the Four Noble Truths is more difficult than mastering the most exquisite worldly skill, it is precisely for this reason that it is so precious. All those who have already attained perfect awakening have realized it by following the same set of laws and orderly procedures. This shows that liberation is not an unattainable, special favor, but a goal that anyone who sincerely follows the teaching in practice has the opportunity to realize.
