<title> The Path of Liberation and a Comprehensive Outline of Practice on the Noble Eightfold Path </title>  

<article>  

I. The Overall Goal of Liberation and Purification  

I.1 The Core of Liberation and the Purpose of the Holy Life  
The core of liberation lies in correctly grasping the path that leads away from suffering. The concrete direction of practice begins with cultivating meditation (samādhi), and on that basis personally realizing the truth through wisdom (paññā). Genuine liberation does not rely on any unbeneficial austerities; merely abandoning such austerities is itself not yet the path of liberation.  

To obtain true liberation one must cultivate virtue (sīla), meditation, and wisdom together, taking these three trainings as the foundation. Only this cultivation of morality, concentration, and wisdom is the right path to awakening (bodhi), the correct way to pure accomplishment and to transcending bondage.  

A wise person should reflect on his own true benefit, choose the right Dhamma, and practice grounded in virtue and wisdom until the mind becomes tranquil. If a bhikkhu practices in this way and reaches the further shore, he can be called the foremost among men.  

The core purpose of the holy life (brahma‑faring) is to understand suffering thoroughly and completely. To do this one must follow a clear path and method, namely the Noble Eightfold Path. This path is, at the same time, the only right path leading to the Deathless; it is the single vehicle (ekayāna) that can purify beings, help them transcend sorrow and lamentation, extinguish pain and distress, realize the true Dhamma, and directly experience Nibbāna.  

I.2 The Step‑by‑Step Fulfilment of the System of Liberation  
All methods of practice form a tightly interconnected system in which the completion of each stage becomes the basis for completing the next. The attainment of liberation does not depend on vague hopes, but on sustained and sequential cultivation of this system of the right path.  

When a practitioner diligently cultivates the various path factors, he need not calculate day by day exactly how much the defilements have diminished, yet he can be sure that the defilements are constantly being extinguished. The various fetters will naturally and gradually wear away and decay, until finally the mind reaches the state of non‑clinging and liberation from all taints (āsavas).  

II. The Practitioner’s Attitude, Character, and Fundamental Reliances  

II.1 The Inner Attitude That Should Be Possessed  
In actual practice, cultivation of the liberative mind cannot be separated from the right attitude and character. A practitioner should abandon arrogant behavior and attitudes, make his own mind inclined to stillness, not swayed by circumstances, and avoid heedlessness, so that all bodily and mental activities move toward purity. Acting for the welfare and happiness of beings is an important direction of the contemplative life.  

When teaching the Dhamma, one should ensure that what is said is excellent in meaning at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end, and that what is taught is a complete and pure holy life.  

The practice of liberation also relies on mindfulness (sati) and clear comprehension (sampajañña). A practitioner must use mindfulness and clear comprehension to brush away the dust and stains of defilements from the mind, to guard the six sense doors and mental processes, so the mind is not scattered, is free from sensual desire, and becomes secure and at peace.  

He should further strive in practice, go forth out of faith, nourish and strengthen his faith, devote himself to meditative reflection, avoid idle chatter, and dedicate himself to freeing himself from the various fetters, even to the point of extinguishing all defilements.  

II.2 Non‑Heedlessness and Reverence for the True Dhamma  
Non‑heedlessness is regarded as supreme among all qualities; therefore, one who is not heedless should practice and repeatedly practice the Noble Eightfold Path.  

The practitioner should stay away from distracting affairs, maintain seclusion and focus, apply himself with unremitting energy, and remain constantly alert, with clear comprehension and mindfulness always present. In order to fulfil the still‑incomplete aggregate of concentration, he should also revere the true Dhamma and dwell firmly established in it.  

On the level of daily life, guarding the sense doors, being moderate in eating, and being devoted to wakefulness are the three basic conditions for upholding the holy life. A practitioner should focus on cultivating these three and persistently putting them into practice.  

If he cannot guard the sense doors, lacks restraint in food, does not practice devoutly, does not know the measure and limits of his own practice, and even undermines the very foundation of the holy life, he will fall into very serious faults in practice.  

II.3 Purity of Mind and Boundless Loving‑Kindness  
The realization of liberation cannot be separated from a pure mind. When the mind is pure and unstained, harboring no crooked or obstructive attitude toward any living being, then on that basis one can approach the path to the Brahmā‑world and walk a higher and purer way.  

At the same time, the fundamental purpose of living the holy life is to completely extinguish sensual desire, ill will, and delusion, and to bring the holy life to its ultimate fulfilment in total non‑greed, non‑hatred, and non‑delusion.  

III. The Concrete Practice of Virtue, Concentration, Wisdom, and the Life of Renunciation  

III.1 Virtue, Concentration, Wisdom, and a Pure Life  
True liberation requires complete cultivation of virtue (sīla), meditation (samādhi), and wisdom (paññā). All endeavors in practice must rely on virtue and be grounded in pure moral conduct.  

Basing oneself on virtue as the root, one then cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path, returning to it again and again. In this way all wholesome qualities can arise, grow, increase, and expand.  

In the life of renunciation, a bhikkhu should sit and walk with a dignified posture, abide with clear mindfulness, dwell in a natural environment far from the bustle of the world, leave the household life for homelessness, undertake pure precepts, and strive in seclusion.  

By practicing wholeheartedly in quiet places, far from worldly disturbance, one gradually cuts off the bonds of defilements, removes inner discontent and craving. This is an important method for purifying the mind.  

On special observance days, by undertaking the eight precepts, dwelling in the Uposatha, and living the holy life, one becomes invulnerable to disturbance or seduction by yakkhas and other non‑human beings.  

Truthfulness and the true Dhamma, together with self‑restraint, constitute the real substance of the holy life. There are arahants who declare of themselves that they constantly dwell in the holy life, taking this as the evidence of their final liberation.  

III.2 Ascetic Simplicity and Fewness of Wishes  
In order to be far from attachment and dependence, practitioners of ascetic practices (dhutaṅga) choose to live in secluded places, subsist on almsfood, wear rag‑robes sewn from discarded cloth, keep only three robes, cultivate fewness of wishes, contentment, avoidance of social groups, cutting off pointless associations, and continue to strive diligently in practice.  

Elsewhere the same qualities are praised in the same way: living in the forest, practicing alms‑rounds, wearing rag‑robes, maintaining the three robes, having few desires and being content, staying away from crowds, not socializing with the worldly, and diligently training.  

In a more general sequence of practice, the practitioner goes forth from the household life into homelessness to live the holy life, uses simple requisites of clothing and lodging, and lives depending on the offerings of the faithful. This simple lifestyle and attitude of fewness of wishes and contentment are both the outward form of the path of liberation and an inner practice of abandoning greed.  

III.3 Pure Holy Life and Reaching the Further Shore  
By following this path that subdues defilements without anger, the practitioner can abide in a pure holy life. When a brahmin endowed with virtue enters the lake of the Dhamma for crossing over, whose waters are clear and unstained, and the noble ones bathe there, then body and mind become pure and he is able to cross to the further shore.  

By walking this middle path one attains the highest result, because this middle path results in the supreme. Living in this way, the pure bhikkhu reaches the further shore and is regarded as the foremost among his peers.  

IV. The Practice of the Establishments of Mindfulness, the Bases of Spiritual Power, and the Awakening Factors  

IV.1 The Four Establishments of Mindfulness as the Single Vehicle  
The four establishments of mindfulness (satipaṭṭhāna) are declared to be the only path that can purify beings, help them transcend sorrow and lamentation, extinguish pain and distress, realize the true Dhamma, and directly experience Nibbāna. They are also called the “single vehicle.”  

When cultivating mindfulness of the body, of feelings, of mind, and of phenomena, the practitioner should always be ardent and energetic, endowed with clear comprehension and mindfulness, restraining craving and distress with regard to the world, and dwelling in observation “as it really is.”  

In cultivating any one of the establishments of mindfulness, one must simultaneously have these three mental qualities: ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness. The purpose in each case is to restrain worldly craving and distress.  

In the practice of the four establishments of mindfulness, ardor means maintaining an unremitting, vigorous attitude; clear comprehension means lucid and precise awareness; mindfulness means continuous, unbroken recollection and attention. In every area of practice the practitioner should maintain these three qualities and use them to subdue worldly greed and distress.  

In the definitions and methods of the four establishments of mindfulness it is especially emphasized that one should dwell with ardor, with clear comprehension, with mindfulness, while restraining greed and distress concerning the world.  

Furthermore, practice of the four establishments of mindfulness in accordance with the path is itself the Noble Eightfold Path; only by following the Eightfold Path can the practice of mindfulness be correctly unfolded.  

IV.2 The Four Bases of Spiritual Power and the Principle of the Middle Balance  
When cultivating the four bases of spiritual power (iddhipāda), one must follow a principle of middle balance: one should not draw back too much in regard to desire (i.e. wholesome aspiration), and one should not apply effort in an excessively strained way; one should not over‑constrict inwardly, nor scatter outwardly with negligence.  

Such a moderate and balanced approach prevents the practice of the bases of spiritual power from becoming withered on the one hand or lax on the other, allowing them to grow gradually and securely.  

The path for cultivating the bases of spiritual power is likewise the Noble Eightfold Path, grounded in right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Elsewhere it is also clearly stated that the path in accordance with the bases of spiritual power is the Noble Eightfold Path, fully including these eight right factors.  

IV.3 The Seven Factors of Awakening and the Pivotal Role of the Seven Sets of Path Factors  
When cultivating the seven factors of awakening (bojjhaṅga) and the remaining sets of path factors, one must follow the principles of seclusion from defilements, relinquishing craving, extinguishing discursive proliferation, and directing all practice toward an attitude of letting go.  

For the practice of the seven awakening factors, more specific methods are given: cultivate them based on seclusion, based on the abandoning of craving, based on cessation, and directed toward letting go.  

Within the seven sets of path factors are included: the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual power, the five spiritual faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the Noble Eightfold Path.  

If one does not cultivate these seven sets of path factors, one cannot reach a mind without clinging, liberated from all taints. If, however, one diligently cultivates them, the mind naturally reaches the state of non‑clinging and liberation from all taints.  

Those who continue to practice, though they do not deliberately measure how much their defilements are reduced each day, can be certain that the defilements are constantly being extinguished and that the fetters are naturally and gradually wearing away and decaying.  

Further, by constantly cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path one is able to fully and completely cultivate all the important path factors: the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, and the seven factors of awakening.  

Through such practice, unwholesome and unskillful states can quickly disappear, an effect compared to storm clouds being stilled by a great wind, or heavy rain washing away dust.  

Deepening one single key Dhamma principle also naturally guides and completes multiple subsequent principles, forming a complete training sequence from the basic to the ultimate.  

V. The Noble Eightfold Path and a Comprehensive Summary of the Right and Wrong Paths  

V.1 The Structure and Definitions of the Noble Eightfold Path  
The Noble Eightfold Path—also called the Eightfold Right Path or the Eightfold Noble Path—consists of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.  

This path is the ancient road traveled by all past rightly enlightened ones; it is also the middle path realized by the Tathāgata in his perfect awakening, which gives rise to vision, gives rise to knowledge, leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to full awakening, and to Nibbāna. It is at the same time the noble truth that is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.  

The only road leading to the cessation of suffering, leading to Nibbāna and the Deathless, is this Noble Eightfold Path.  

Within the framework of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of the path is precisely the path that ends suffering, and its practical method is the Noble Eightfold Path, containing the eight correct items of practice just mentioned. By following this ancient track of the noble ones, the practitioner can know suffering, know the origin of suffering, know the cessation of suffering, and know the path leading toward the cessation of suffering.  

This path is also the true content common to the life of the ascetic (samaṇa), the brahmin, and the holy life (brahmacariya). The fruits of the ascetic, the fruits of the brahmin, and the fruits of the holy life all include the fruit of stream‑entry, once‑returning, non‑returning, and arahantship. In doctrinal meaning, the essence of the ascetic, the essence of the brahmin, and the essence of the holy life are all aimed ultimately at the complete ending of sensual desire, the ending of ill will, and the ending of ignorance.  

Right view is the correct understanding of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering; that is, the correct comprehension of the Four Noble Truths.  

Right intention is the intention or mental orientation toward renunciation, toward non‑ill‑will, and toward harmlessness.  

Right speech is abstaining from false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle, frivolous chatter.  

Right action is refraining from killing living beings, from stealing, and from sexual misconduct.  

Right livelihood is abandoning wrong means of livelihood and maintaining one’s life by proper, blameless means.  

Right effort is: (1) making an effort to prevent unarisen unwholesome states from arising; (2) making an effort to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen; (3) making an effort to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen; and (4) making an effort to maintain, increase, and bring to fulfillment wholesome states that have already arisen.  

Right mindfulness is the continuous, focused awareness of the body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, thereby restraining craving and distress with regard to the world.  

Right concentration is the unified state of mind obtained by cultivating the four jhānas (absorptions):  

– The first jhāna: seclusion from sense desires and unwholesome states, accompanied by applied and sustained thought, born of seclusion, and filled with rapture and happiness.  
– The second jhāna: inner tranquility and oneness of mind, without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and happiness born of concentration.  
– The third jhāna: abandoning rapture and dwelling in equanimity, fully endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension, experiencing happiness with equanimity and mindfulness.  
– The fourth jhāna: surpassing both pleasure and pain, with the previous joy and grief extinguished, reaching a state that is neither pleasant nor painful, with purity of equanimity and mindfulness.  

V.2 The Eightfold Wrong Path and the Distinction between Good and Evil Persons  
Opposed to the Noble Eightfold Path is the eightfold wrong path, namely wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration.  

Wrong conduct is composed of these eight erroneous factors of practice, while right conduct is composed of the eight right path factors from right view to right concentration. The Noble Eightfold Path is the concrete content of wholesome states; the eightfold wrong path is the concrete manifestation of unwholesome states.  

Those who practice the eightfold wrong path are called evil persons; those who practice the Noble Eightfold Path are called good persons.  

If one practices the eightfold wrong path and in addition has wrong knowledge and wrong liberation, one is considered an even worse evil person than ordinary evil persons. If one practices the Noble Eightfold Path and also has right knowledge and right liberation, one is a superior good person, surpassing ordinary good persons.  

Furthermore, the path factors gather and associate according to their own kind: wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration, together with wrong knowledge and wrong liberation, gather with path factors of the same nature. Right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, together with right knowledge and right liberation, also associate with path factors of the same nature.  

If the Noble Eightfold Path is lost, then the right path in conformity with the cessation of suffering is lost. If the Noble Eightfold Path is aroused, then the right path in conformity with the cessation of suffering is aroused. Practicing the Noble Eightfold Path can serve as the provisions for going from this shore to the further shore; cultivating these eight factors again and again allows one to cross beyond what is hard to cross.  

V.3 The Functions, Similes, and Multiple Names of the Noble Eightfold Path  
The Noble Eightfold Path can serve as the support and basis for the mind, making it stable and not easily overturned. If the mind lacks the support of the Noble Eightfold Path, it easily wavers and topples.  

The first seven factors of the Noble Eightfold Path—from right view through right mindfulness—are the supporting conditions and requisites for noble right concentration. Only on the basis of these seven factors can the unified state of mind called right concentration be fulfilled.  

The Noble Eightfold Path is illustrated by various similes to explain its role and function. It is likened to a single vehicle; its road is called “straight,” its destination “fearless,” and the vehicle itself “noiseless” and “smooth‑running.”  

When equipped with this “Dhamma‑wheel,” moral shame and moral dread are the platform on which it rests; right mindfulness is its protecting canopy; right Dhamma is the power of its guidance; right view is its forerunner and guide. Relying on this vehicle, practitioners can all reach Nibbāna.  

Again, it is compared to a raft used for crossing a river: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration are eight correct routes that help the practitioner cross from this shore to the further shore. Nibbāna is described as the flat and blissful land that should be reached, and the Noble Eightfold Path as the right road leading there.  

Because of its inner meaning, the Noble Eightfold Path is also called the path of the ascetic (samaṇa‑dhamma), the brahmin‑path, and the holy life. One who practices the Noble Eightfold Path is precisely one who lives the holy life; when sensual desire, ill will, and delusion, the three poisons, are completely extinguished, that is the ultimate fulfilment of the holy life.  

The essence of the non‑holy life, by contrast, is the eightfold wrong path, including the eight factors from wrong view to wrong concentration.  

V.4 The Noble Eightfold Path as the Only Right Path and the Overall Framework of Practice  
The Noble Eightfold Path is repeatedly declared to be the only road and method for accomplishing all goals of practice. It is applicable to attaining Nibbāna, realizing arahantship, abandoning defilements, and knowing the truth.  

There is a definite road and method for reaching Nibbāna, and that road is the Noble Eightfold Path. The road leading to the cessation of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path; the road that arrives at the cessation of suffering is also the Noble Eightfold Path. As long as one cultivates and repeatedly practices these eight factors, one can reach Nibbāna, attain Nibbāna, and ultimately be fully established in Nibbāna.  

By cultivating and repeatedly practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, one can cause unarisen wholesome qualities to arise. By purifying the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, one can make it pure, bright, stainless, and undefiled, and cause unarisen states of purity to arise. The only exception to these effects is the time when a Tathāgata does not appear in the world.  

The Noble Eightfold Path is also called the “stream of the noble path” (ariyamagga‑sota), whose concrete content is the same eight factors: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.  

In the cultivation of mindfulness, recollecting the content of these eight factors of the right path is also an important task for the practitioner.  

VI. Unified Principles for Cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path and the Taming of the Three Poisons  

VI.1 Threefold Single Direction: Based on Seclusion, Non‑Craving, Cessation, and Directed to Letting Go  
In the methods for cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path, a unified set of common principles is repeatedly emphasized. The cultivation of all right path factors is based on three shared principles: relying on seclusion, relying on the abandoning of craving, relying on cessation, and finally directing all practice toward letting go.  

Whether it be right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, or right concentration, each factor, when cultivated, must be: based on seclusion, based on non‑craving, based on cessation, and directed toward letting go.  

These principles of practice are repeatedly restated as universally applicable to each factor of the Noble Eightfold Path. Every factor should be cultivated following the same fundamental method. Through sustained cultivation by this same method, various fruits of practice can be attained.  

The principles for cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path can thus be summarized: based on seclusion, based on non‑craving, based on cessation, and finally directed toward letting go. Such explanations appear not only in general expositions of the noble path, but also in the detailed instructions for specific practices.  

VI.2 Aiming at the Taming of Greed, Hatred, and Delusion  
Besides this “threefold single direction,” another core method is to take as one’s purpose the taming of the three root defilements. In cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path, one should aim at the complete taming of sensual desire, the complete taming of ill will, and the complete taming of delusion. This aim applies equally to each factor from right view to right concentration.  

In many teachings that expound the Noble Eightfold Path, it is clearly stated that one should take the thorough taming of greed, hatred, and delusion as the central rule. Only through sustained cultivation of each factor of the Noble Eightfold Path can one truly accomplish the thorough subduing of the three poisons.  

VI.3 Two Directions of Practice: Oriented toward Letting Go and toward Taming  
Regarding the orientation of practice on the Noble Eightfold Path, there are two clearly stated directions.  

The first is practice based on letting go: by following the principles of seclusion, non‑craving, and cessation, and directing the mind toward letting go, one cultivates the eight factors of the noble path. Whether one is cultivating right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, or right concentration, this single set of principles pervades them all.  

The second is practice based on taming: in order to completely tame sensual desire, ill will, and delusion, one likewise cultivates each of the eight factors of the noble path.  

These two orientations are repeatedly emphasized in different teachings: sometimes expressed as the first method—based on the threefold single direction and finally oriented to letting go; sometimes as the second method—taking the complete taming of greed, hatred, and delusion as the goal.  

Whichever orientation one adopts, this framework is said to be universally applicable to all components of the Noble Eightfold Path.  

VI.4 The Fundamental Orientation of the Noble Eightfold Path toward Nibbāna  
The fundamental orientation of the Noble Eightfold Path is toward Nibbāna—tending toward Nibbāna, inclining toward Nibbāna, drawing near to Nibbāna. If one frequently cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path, one constantly strengthens this orientation toward Nibbāna.  

When cultivating the noble path, one should always proceed based on seclusion, based on non‑craving, and based on cessation, and direct all practices toward letting go. Each factor—right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration—should be cultivated by relying on seclusion, non‑craving, and cessation, and oriented toward letting go.  

VII. Conditions and Foundations for the Arising and Fulfilment of the Noble Eightfold Path  

VII.1 Seven Supportive Conditions and Seven Causes for the Realization of the Path  
For the Noble Eightfold Path to arise and be fulfilled, seven important supportive conditions and causes are taught:  

1. Having good friends (kalyāṇa‑mitta)  
2. Being endowed with virtuous conduct  
3. Being endowed with zeal and aspiration  
4. Being self‑reliant or inwardly well‑established  
5. Being endowed with right view  
6. Being endowed with non‑heedlessness  
7. Being endowed with wise attention (yoniso‑manasikāra)  

Anyone who possesses any one of the above can rightly expect to be able to cultivate and repeatedly cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path. Furthermore, as long as one possesses any one of these seven conditions, one should apply oneself to practicing the noble path and to extensive and deep implementation of it.  

These seven conditions, whether for practice based on letting go or for practice based on taming, are the fundamental prerequisites that prompt practitioners to cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path and bring it to fulfilment.  

VII.2 Discipline as the Fundamental Reliance of Practice  
All undertakings in practice must rely on discipline and be grounded in it. Only with virtue as the root is it possible to properly cultivate and repeatedly cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.  

When a practitioner cultivates the noble path based on virtue, all wholesome qualities are able to arise, grow, increase, and expand. This shows that virtue is not merely a preliminary condition; it is an indispensable reliance in the entire system of liberation.  

VII.3 The Roles of Non‑Heedlessness and Good Friends in Practicing the Noble Eightfold Path  
Non‑heedlessness is the foremost among all qualities, so one who is not heedless should cultivate and repeatedly cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.  

Having good friends is a crucial supportive condition: a bhikkhu endowed with good friends can rightly expect to be able to practice the noble path and to keep deepening his implementation of it.  

In many teachings it is emphasized that possessing any one of the following—good friends, virtuous conduct, zeal and aspiration, right view, non‑heedlessness, or wise attention—can serve as the starting point for cultivating the noble path and for its arising and fulfilment.  

VIII. The Integration and Extension of the Path of Liberation within the Various Path Factors  

VIII.1 The Unified Relationship between the Noble Eightfold Path and the Other Sets of Factors  
When selecting topics for teaching the Dhamma, one often includes as content: the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of awakening, and the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path.  

The noble path is proclaimed as the root that brings all path factors to completion. By continually cultivating the noble path, these other path factors can be comprehensively and fully practiced. The cultivation of the bases of spiritual power, the factors of awakening, and other path factors in accordance with the path likewise all rely on the Noble Eightfold Path as their standard.  

In practicing the seven factors of awakening, one uses the very same principles as for the Noble Eightfold Path: cultivate based on seclusion, based on non‑craving, based on cessation, and directed toward letting go.  

This shows that throughout the whole system of practice, the principles of seclusion, non‑craving, cessation, and letting go are universally applicable common rules.  

VIII.2 The Single Vehicle and the Only Road of Liberation  
The so‑called “single vehicle” is the only way by which beings can be purified, can transcend sorrow and lamentation, extinguish pain and distress, realize the true Dhamma, and directly experience Nibbāna.  

The four establishments of mindfulness are an important core of this single vehicle, while the Noble Eightfold Path is the eightfold noble path that, at the most fundamental level, gathers and unifies all path factors.  

Cultivating the establishments of mindfulness can cause wholesome states to grow and forms a pure collection of wholesome qualities. When cultivating the bases of spiritual power, the awakening factors, and other path factors, one must likewise follow the path and principles of the noble path.  

IX. Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension: Concrete Practice in Bodily and Mental Activities  

IX.1 The Full Application of Clear Comprehension in All Activities  
In the practice of mindfulness and clear comprehension, practitioners are instructed to maintain awareness throughout even the smallest daily activities.  

When walking forward or back, looking ahead or looking around, bending or stretching the limbs, carrying the outer robe and bowl, eating, chewing, and tasting, attending to urination and defecation, walking, standing, sitting, lying down, speaking, and keeping silent—in all actions one should act with clear comprehension. Elsewhere it is again emphasized that when going forward and when returning, one must act with proper awareness.  

Only by maintaining mindfulness and clear comprehension in every movement can practice cease to be merely a matter of sitting meditation and become a continuous wakefulness that permeates the whole of life.  

IX.2 The Bhikkhu’s Firm Mind in Turning Away from the Dust of the World  
When a bhikkhu practices and abides according to these teachings, and when his mind has long been directed toward turning away from the dust of the world, then even if a king or his relatives try to tempt him to disrobe by offering wealth and treasures, his mind will not turn toward what is base. There will be absolutely no possibility of his returning to lay life.  

Such firmness of mind arises from the long‑term cultivation of habits of seclusion and renunciation through the Noble Eightfold Path and the various path factors.  

IX.3 The Difference between Outer Form and Inner Realization  
In the essential nature of practice and realization, one cannot obtain the superhuman noble knowledge and bliss merely by relying on external form. A layperson who practices according to the stages of meditation can also realize such superhuman noble knowledge and bliss.  

This shows that liberation does not belong exclusively to an external status or appearance; the key lies in whether one actually practices according to the true Dhamma.  

X. The Holy Life, the Brahmā Vehicle, and Similes for Reaching the Further Shore  

X.1 The Brahmā Vehicle and the Taming of the Three Poisons  
The core components of the “Brahmā‑vehicle” are precisely the eight factors of the noble path. By cultivating and repeatedly cultivating the noble path—whether right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, or right concentration—the aim is always the complete taming of the three root defilements: greed, hatred, and delusion.  

This rule of cultivation and taming is held to be universally applicable to all components of the noble path. One who practices the noble path is exactly a practitioner of the holy life, and the ultimate of the holy life consists in the complete ending of sensual desire, the complete ending of ill will, and the complete ending of delusion.  

X.2 Similes of the Vehicle, the Raft, and the Messenger  
The relationship between liberation and the Noble Eightfold Path is illustrated by many vivid similes. The straight road, the fearless land, and the noiseless, smooth‑running vehicle symbolize the nature of the noble path as the vehicle of liberation. Moral shame and moral dread are the supporting platform of this vehicle, right mindfulness is its protecting canopy, right Dhamma is its means of control, and right view is its guiding direction. With such a vehicle, beings can all reach Nibbāna.  

The noble path is also compared to a raft for crossing a river of suffering: when a practitioner grasps this raft, he can cross the ocean of birth‑and‑death suffering and go from this shore to the further shore.  

Another simile says: serenity and insight (samatha and vipassanā) are like a messenger who comes swiftly to deliver a mission, and the noble eightfold path is like the correct road along which this messenger returns by the way he came, enabling the practitioner to follow the right road back to the original source, Nibbāna.  

X.3 Pure Holy Life and the Path to the Brahmā‑World  
When a practitioner, without anger, reduces and subdues defilements and abides in a pure holy life, and when his mind becomes pure and unstained, with no crooked or obstructive attitude toward any living being, then on this basis he can walk the path to the Brahmā‑world.  

In this way, the path of liberation is not only a road for escaping suffering; it is also a pure way that opens up to higher realms.  

XI. Integrated Practice: From Foundational Training to Final Liberation  

XI.1 A Summary of Ardor, Clear Comprehension, Mindfulness, and Non‑Heedlessness  
In all levels of practice—whether in the establishments of mindfulness, the bases of spiritual power, the awakening factors, the noble path, or the other path factors—several common essentials are never absent: energetic ardor, clear comprehension, single‑mindedness, a mind that is pure and unstained, concentration that is unscattered, and a mind that abides on a single object.  

When cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness and other methods, the practitioner should maintain ardent effort, possess clear comprehension and mindfulness, restrain worldly craving and distress, and abide in observation as it really is.  

In practicing any establishment of mindfulness and any Dhamma method, one should always be endowed with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, using them to subdue worldly greed and distress. Non‑heedlessness and energy are key attitudes that run through the entire path.  

XI.2 Using the Noble Path to Cut Off All Bondage  
The Noble Eightfold Path is not only the right way to know suffering, abandon its origin, realize its cessation, and develop the path; it is also the path to be cultivated for the sake of knowing, fully knowing, completely exhausting, and cutting off all bonds.  

If one wishes to utterly cut off all such bonds, one should cultivate the noble path. From right view through right concentration, the eightfold noble path is both the Deathless road leading to Nibbāna and the key means for turning from the non‑holy life to the true holy life.  

When the noble path is cultivated to the point of being pure, bright, stainless, and undefiled, it can bring about unarisen states of purity, and finally accomplish the complete extinction of sensual desire, ill will, and delusion, culminating in full liberation.  

XI.3 The Vehicle of Liberation and the Ultimate Goal  
In summary, the path of liberation is a road founded on virtue, with concentration as its vehicle and wisdom as its guide.  

Starting from the abandonment of arrogance, the quieting of the mind, non‑heedlessness, and the purification of all actions, through the complete cultivation of virtue, concentration, and wisdom, together with the progressive fulfilment of the establishments of mindfulness, the bases of spiritual power, the awakening factors, and the other path factors, everything is ultimately gathered into the single vehicle that is the Noble Eightfold Path.  

Taking this straight road as the path, the fearless land as the goal, and the noiseless, smooth vehicle as the means, relying on moral shame and moral dread as the platform, right mindfulness as the canopy, right Dhamma as the control, and right view as the guide, the practitioner can cross the ocean of suffering, transcend sorrow and lamentation, directly realize Nibbāna, and bring the holy life and right awakening to completion.
