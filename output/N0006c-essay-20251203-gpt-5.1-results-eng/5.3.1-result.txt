<title> The Path of Liberation and the Core Characteristics of the Teaching that Leads to Nirvana </title>
<article>
I. The Content of the Teaching and the Realm of Nirvana Without Remainder  
I.1 The Core Focus When Teaching Sentient Beings  
When teaching sentient beings, for those who come to inquire, one should explain to them the realm of nirvana without remainder, so that they understand what ultimate liberation is. This explanation is not merely conceptual; it must enable the inquirer to understand nirvana without remainder as an ultimately tranquil state, a state of liberation that is free from all afflictions and bonds, with no residue remaining. By elucidating the realm of nirvana without remainder, sentient beings come to know the ultimate aim and perfect destination of practice, and thus will not lose their way in the course of following the path.

II. The Core Principles of the Path of Liberation  
II.1 The Existence of Liberation and Its Fulfillment Through Wisdom  
Amid the various laws and principles of the world, there truly exists a path that leads to liberation. This path of liberation is not fabricated; it really exists in the world, but it requires wisdom in order to be truly realized. Lacking wisdom, one cannot correctly discern truth and falsehood, good and evil, right and wrong, nor can one arrive at the right view and right conduct required for liberation. Therefore, wisdom becomes the fundamental condition for stepping onto the path of liberation; it is the key power that runs through the entire process of liberation.

II.2 The Necessity of a World-Transcending Practice  
Since the path of liberation exists and must be realized through wisdom, practitioners should consciously pursue a form of practice that is removed from the dust of the world. This “removal from the world” does not mean a merely external escape in form; rather, it is an inner distancing from and letting go of worldly toil, desires, and attachments—a deliberate orientation of practice toward purity. Only by withdrawing body and mind from the fetters of the world can wisdom grow and can one steadily advance along the path of liberation.

III. The Essential Nature of the Teaching that Leads to Nirvana  
III.1 A Teaching Centered on Leading to Nirvana  
The teaching that accords with the path of liberation has, as its fundamental nature, a core orientation of leading beings to nirvana. All genuine instructions, expositions, and methods of practice—if they accord with this essential nature—must ultimately point to nirvana and not be disturbed or diverted by other worldly aims. This nirvana-centered guidance establishes the final goal of the path of practice, enabling practitioners to understand that all learning and implementation exist for the sake of approaching and realizing nirvana.

III.2 The Quality of Purity and Freedom from Defilement  
This teaching that leads to nirvana is itself characterized by purity and freedom from defilement. It is not tainted by afflictions, contamination, or wrong views; in both content and direction it remains pure and upright. Because it is pure and undefiled, those who practice according to this teaching will not be led toward false goals, nor will they generate new attachments and defilements along the way. On the contrary, in the course of practice they gradually wash away old contaminations and advance toward a state of inner and outer purity.

III.3 Able to Destroy Various Obstacles  
This teaching also possesses the power to destroy all manner of obstacles. On the path of practice one will inevitably encounter many hindrances, including afflictions, wrong views, doubt, laziness, and fear. The pure teaching that leads to nirvana is precisely what can eliminate these obstacles one by one. It not only teaches how to move forward, but also helps practitioners to cross over the many inner and outer barriers, thereby opening up the way ahead and allowing the previously obscured path of liberation to be revealed.

IV. The Unique Abilities of the Perfectly Enlightened One  
IV.1 Causing the Unarisen Path to Arise  
In the actual functioning of the path of liberation and the teaching, a perfectly enlightened one possesses extremely sublime and unique abilities. One of these is the ability to cause the unarisen path to arise. That is, with regard to the path of liberation that has not yet appeared in the minds of sentient beings, the perfectly enlightened one, by the power of awakening, can bring it forth within their minds. Through the enlightened one’s teaching and exemplification, the path of liberation that was formerly unknown and never activated can, for the first time, be revealed and established in the hearts of practitioners.

IV.2 Proclaiming the Hitherto Unheard Path  
Another unique ability of a perfectly enlightened one is to proclaim a path that has never before been proclaimed. This does not mean arbitrary innovation; rather, in the absence of any prior basis of instruction, relying solely on his own complete awakening, he clearly discloses the path of liberation, so that the world hears for the first time the content and sequence of this path. Without relying on any pre-existing lineage, a perfectly enlightened one can, in a place without a teacher, bring forth a complete path to liberation, giving sentient beings a practical course of cultivation to follow.

IV.3 Knowing, Awakening to, and Penetrating this Path  
Furthermore, a perfectly enlightened one does not merely know of the existence of this path of liberation; he truly knows the path, awakens to the path, and fully penetrates the path. “Knowing” means having a complete understanding of the content, structure, and stages of the path. “Awakening” means personally realizing the truths and the nirvanic realm to which this path points. “Penetrating” means being able to move effortlessly along this path from beginning to end, with no doubt or obscuration whatsoever. Because he is complete in these three aspects, the perfectly enlightened one is able to show beings the path of liberation in its entirety.

V. A Unified Understanding of the Dharma and the Buddhas’ Awakening  
V.1 Taking Knowledge of the Differentiations of Dharma as the Basis  
In facing the Buddhas and the path of liberation, establishing firm confidence requires a correct basis. This basis lies in knowing the differentiations of Dharma, not in knowing the thoughts of the Buddhas. In other words, a practitioner’s discernment and confidence are not founded on being able to peer into the inner mental activities of the Buddhas, but on a clear understanding of the distinctions, levels, and scope of Dharma itself. As long as one can clearly distinguish the categories and levels of dharmas, one can, on that basis, determine whether they lead to liberation.

V.2 All Buddhas Accomplish Awakening by Relying on the Same Dharma  
Because one can discern the differentiations of Dharma, one comes to understand that all Buddhas accomplish awakening by relying on the same Dharma. Although the Buddhas appear in different times and places, the fundamental Dharma principles they follow in the process of realizing awakening and becoming Buddhas are the same, and do not vary with the changes of time and space. This shows that the path of liberation does not change arbitrarily; it follows definite and unchanging principles, and all Buddhas perfect their awakening in accordance with these principles.

V.3 Realizing the Essential Dharma is to Know that What the Buddhas Have Realized is Non-different  
When a practitioner truly realizes these essential Dharma principles—that is, realizes the core content and stages of the path of liberation—he naturally understands that what all Buddhas have realized is without difference. Since all Buddhas become accomplished relying on the same Dharma, and this Dharma can be realized and understood, then once one has realized this Dharma, one can be certain that the realm awakened to by all Buddhas is essentially the same, without higher or lower, without distinction. This understanding—established on the basis of knowing the differentiations of Dharma and realizing its essential points—makes one’s view of the Buddhas’ awakening firm and unshakable.

VI. The Timelessness and Universal Applicability of the Methods of Liberation  
VI.1 Effectiveness that Extends through the Three Times  
Among the benefits of the path of liberation, there is one particularly important feature: its temporal efficacy. This path of liberation is an effective means of deliverance in the past, in the future, and in the present alike. Beings in the past relied on it to attain liberation; beings in the future will still be able to attain liberation by relying on it; and beings in the present era likewise can leave suffering and gain release through this path.

VI.2 A Firm and Unchanging Reliance for Liberation  
Because this path is equally effective across the three times, it is not merely a temporary expedient, nor a makeshift approach suited only to a specific age. Rather, it possesses a stability and universality that transcends temporal limitations. For this reason, practitioners can confidently regard this path as a reliable refuge, without worrying that it will lose its efficacy as time and circumstances change. In this way, the path of liberation, the pure teaching that leads to nirvana, the awakening abilities of the perfectly enlightened ones, and the understanding of the unity of the Buddhas’ realization together constitute a path of liberation that is truly effective in the past, present, and future.
