<title> The Complete Picture of the Fruits of Practice and of Final Liberation </title>
<article>

I. The Overall Meaning of Spiritual Attainment  

When practice is brought to fulfillment, its central fruit is that the practitioner’s mind is no longer disturbed by any useless suffering and distress, and is no longer dragged down by sorrow that brings no benefit. Such a state of freedom from fruitless affliction must be founded on a firm basis of virtue (sīla), concentration (samādhi), wisdom (paññā), liberation, and the knowledge and vision of liberation.  

When a practitioner is endowed with pure moral conduct, abides in unshakable concentration, possesses correct and complete wisdom, and has attained liberation of mind together with the direct knowledge and vision of that liberation, then in everything he does—when he sees, when he hears the various teachings, when he draws near to good spiritual friends, when he goes to serve them with respect, when he recollects the true Dhamma, and even when he resolves to go forth into homelessness—great and far-reaching benefit is produced.  

Such an accomplished one has reached the most excellent purity and has become a true brahmin in the genuine sense. This attainment depends on no external form: it completely transcends all outer marks and status symbols, and takes only inner purity and liberation as its standard. A noble one who has awakened, dwelling in this state, is without guilt and without fault. His thoughts do not fall away through forgetfulness or heedlessness; rather, he can constantly maintain mindfulness and is always established in clear knowing.  

II. Awakening and Direct Vision: The Fulfillment of Right View and the Light of Wisdom  

True awakening arises from a complete realization of dependent origination. When a practitioner thoroughly knows the arising and passing away of all phenomena, and deeply experiences the reality of arising through conditions and ceasing through conditions, there arises unprecedented wisdom, right view, radiance, and awakening. Through this wisdom, his understanding of the Dhamma is no longer one‑sided, but all‑around, penetrating, and complete.  

A noble disciple who has heard the teaching and fully understands the true nature of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—reaches a state of light, and is called “one of clear seeing.” Such a noble disciple is complete in his view; he has reached direct vision and can behold the truth here and now, no longer remaining merely on the level of hearing and thinking. When he contemplates, as they really are, the arising and passing of the five aggregates, their pleasure and pain, and their impermanence, he inevitably becomes disenchanted with them. Because of disenchantment he becomes dispassionate; through dispassion he is liberated.  

At the moment of liberation there naturally arises the knowledge of liberation. He clearly understands that his life has reached the brink of its end, and realizes: “Birth is finished, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further becoming.” He will not again be bound by future existence.  

Contemplation of the six sense bases and their six objects is even more crucial for awakening. A noble disciple must come to a true and complete understanding of the pull, the danger, and the way of escape regarding the six sense faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—and their corresponding six objects. He must fully and as they are understand three aspects of these six: the nature of their delight, the nature of their danger, and the nature of their escape. Only with such complete understanding is one qualified to declare that one has attained unsurpassed perfect awakening. As long as a person has not understood, as they really are, the sweetness, the peril, and the escape in regard to the six sense bases, he cannot claim to have attained unsurpassed perfect awakening.  

When a practitioner has thus understood the sweetness, the peril, and the escape with regard to the six sense bases, he may rightly declare that he has attained unsurpassed perfect awakening and know for certain that his mind is liberated. He is confident that this life is his last life, and that there will be no further round of rebirth. Such direct and accurate knowledge also makes him see that only by fully understanding the attraction of the six objects, the danger in them, and the path of escape from them can one realize unsurpassed awakening, attain complete liberation of the heart, and no longer be bound by birth and death.  

The accomplishment of wisdom is multi‑layered and manifold. One whose practice is complete not only truly discerns the different levels of inferior, middling, and superior Dhammas, distinguishing their coarse, middling, and excellent qualities, but also manifests many outstanding qualities of wisdom.  

He possesses great, boundless wisdom, and broad, all‑encompassing wisdom, as well as vast and expansive wisdom. His wisdom is firm and profound—deep wisdom; it is incomparable—unequalled wisdom; it is grand and far‑reaching—great wisdom; and it is rich, manifold, and abundant—much wisdom. His thinking is swift—quick wisdom; it is light and agile—nimble wisdom; sharp and incisive—keen wisdom; and fast in penetration—rapid wisdom. His understanding is piercing and decisive—discriminating wisdom, by which he skilfully analyses, chooses, and judges rightly.  

Because his contemplation and understanding of the Four Noble Truths are so deep, the practitioner’s view is firm and unshakable. This steadfast view manifests as follows: no matter what arguments or challenges come from any quarter, none can shake his understanding and confidence in the truth. Only if a practitioner possesses the four crucial knowledges just described is he a true practitioner, able in this very life to realize for himself the genuine meaning of the spiritual life. Without these four knowledges, he cannot be called a true practitioner and cannot realize for himself, in this life, the true meaning of the path.  

The completeness of understanding determines whether practice succeeds. Only those with complete understanding can truly reach the goal of practice and, in this present life, realize and abide in the state of fulfillment. Those lacking complete understanding cannot achieve the true goal of practice and cannot, in this life, realize and abide in that state of completion.  

III. Contemplating Things as They Really Are, the Proportion of Suffering, and Its Ending  

If a noble disciple practises in accordance with the teaching and contemplates, as they really are, the four kinds of nutriment and the various conditions that support life and sustain defilements, then, when he understands the nature and workings of these defilements and phenomena, he can cut off the fetters that arise from them, and may even reach the final liberation where “there is nothing further to be done,” never returning to this world. Such contemplation is not an abstract speculation, but a direct experiencing and clear seeing of bodily and mental phenomena as they actually are.  

In this process of practice there is a particular principle of direct realization that is especially crucial: the “principle of proportion between suffering that has ceased and suffering that remains.” When the mass of suffering that a practitioner has actually brought to an end is vast, while the mass of suffering still remaining is extremely small, then the suffering that has ceased far, far exceeds that which is left—so much so that the latter cannot compare even to a hundredth, a thousandth, or a hundred‑thousandth part of the former. This direct vision of the real decrease and near‑total cessation of suffering lets the practitioner know clearly that the path he walks has come close to its final goal, and is no longer merely a matter of theoretical inference.  

As he contemplates the five aggregates and all phenomena, the noble disciple, seeing them as they are, becomes disenchanted with the aggregates, and, by the same correct observation, he becomes disenchanted with all phenomena as a whole. This disenchantment is not a negative denial; rather, it is the recognition that clinging to them only brings endless future trouble. Naturally he no longer generates desire for them; the heart is without craving. Because there is no craving, there is liberation.  

At the time of liberation, the practitioner gives rise to the knowledge “I am liberated.” He clearly knows that his life is ended, his pure practice has been established, what had to be done is fully done, and there will be no more states of rebirth. He simultaneously realizes, “What had to be done is done; there will be no further becoming,” and knows deeply that there will be no future round of birth.  

Further, when a noble disciple contemplates in this way, he not only becomes disenchanted with the five aggregates, and—through disenchantment—dispassionate, and—through dispassion—liberated, and at liberation gives rise to the knowledge of liberation, understanding “Birth is finished, the holy life has been fulfilled, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further becoming,” but he also turns to regard all conditioned phenomena as a whole with radical disenchantment. Through this disenchantment he becomes utterly without desire, and through this absence of desire he attains an even deeper level of liberation. In this more ultimate liberation, there arises a firm knowledge of “I am liberated”; he understands that the course of life has reached its utmost limit, that his pure practice is without any lack, that everything that ought to be done has been done, and that from now on there will be no form of rebirth whatsoever.  

This way of contemplating things as they are leads directly to the ending of suffering. By such contemplation the practitioner can completely cut off the causes and conditions of suffering and truly reach the ultimate cessation of suffering. This includes insight into the relationship between the mind and the six sense objects. The attitude the mind adopts toward the six kinds of objects determines whether nirvāṇa can be realized.  

If the mind neither delights in, praises, nor is infatuated with the six objects, it will not depend upon them, nor will it grasp or cling to them; in that way, nirvāṇa can be entered. Conversely, if the mind delights in the six objects, praises them, and is deeply infatuated with them, then it will inevitably depend on and cling to them, and thus will not enter nirvāṇa. This may be called the core principle that “letting go of clinging is precisely nirvāṇa.”  

Therefore only a noble disciple who contemplates in this way and has heard the teaching can truly know the truth. As long as he has not yet clearly known the sweetness, the peril, and the escape in relation to the six sense bases, he must not claim to have attained unsurpassed perfect awakening. Only after he has completely understood the nature of delight, the nature of danger, and the nature of liberation can he say that he has completed the whole progression from suffering to the cessation of suffering, and, on the basis of his own direct realization, declare that he has attained unsurpassed perfect awakening, knows that his mind is liberated, and that this life is his last life, with no future rebirth.  

IV. Stream-entry, Freedom from Bad Destinations, and the Stage of Non‑regression  

On the path of liberation, stream‑entry is a crucial stage. When a practitioner has fulfilled certain necessary conditions—for example, he has pacified the five kinds of fear and hostility, has accomplished the four factors of stream‑entry, and, with wisdom, skilfully contemplates the noble truths and is adept at penetrating their meanings—then, if he makes a wish, he can, on the basis of his own realization, clearly discern that he has been freed from all bad destinations such as hell, the animal realm, the realm of hungry ghosts, and from evil births, bad destinies, and places of downfall. He knows that the hell, animal, and ghost realms, evil births, bad destinies, and places of downfall have all been brought to an end, and that they will no longer be his destinations. Thus he attains the fruit of stream‑entry; the phenomena that lead to downfall have been destroyed, and he is firmly set on the course to full awakening.  

When a noble disciple has accomplished seven wholesome qualities, then, if he aspires to it, he can likewise personally know and confirm that hell, the animal realm, the realm of hungry ghosts, evil births, and bad destinies have all vanished for him. He then attains the fruit of stream‑entry, and is definitely proceeding toward right awakening, no longer liable to stray onto wrong paths.  

On the other hand, anyone who has perfectly accomplished four particular qualities can also completely transcend fear of all bad destinies, and will no longer fear the realms of hell, animals, hungry ghosts, or any evil birth or bad destiny, because he now stands upon the safe and broad highway that leads to awakening.  

The attainment that comes through the “Dhamma‑mirror” teaching shows the same firmness. When a practitioner realizes a fruit through the Dhamma‑mirror, his attainment becomes utterly secure; all states that could lead to downfall have been completely destroyed. He reaches the stage of non‑regression and is firmly headed toward perfectly right awakening, with no possibility of turning back.  

As mentioned earlier, when a practitioner fulfils a certain set of three conditions, then, if he so wishes, he can, on the basis of his own direct realization, know that he has been entirely freed from the bad destinies of hell, the animal realm, and the realm of hungry ghosts. He has attained the fruit of stream‑entry, will never again fall into bad destinies, and is definitely set on the path to final awakening.  

Thus, whether it is the fruit of accomplishing the seven qualities, the benefit of completing the four qualities, or the attainment that comes after pacifying the five kinds of fear and hostility and accomplishing the four factors of stream‑entry, they all point to the same thing: the noble disciple can personally know and realize that the bad destinies are finished, the evil paths are ended, and places of downfall will never again be his future destinations. He is sure of having attained the fruit of stream‑entry; the causes of downfall are destroyed, and he is definitely headed toward right and perfect awakening, without any danger of falling again into unwholesome paths.  

V. The State of Liberation, the Final Body, and Abandoning Craving  

The ultimate state of liberation necessarily manifests on several levels. First, the practitioner knows for himself that he will not take another existence: he understands that no further form of life will arise in the future. He sees, as it really is, that his practice has been completed and that the pure holy life has been perfectly established; he knows that the bonds of life have been completely cut off. Such a practitioner is not only a noble disciple but a “liberated‑in‑mind.” Only one whose mind is liberated is called a great person; one whose mind is not liberated is not called a great person.  

In such liberation, the practitioner no longer clings to or craves the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—and thus the mind is freed from them. When the mind is liberated, all wrong views such as “life is identical with the body” or “life is one thing and the body another” are cut off, abandoned, destroyed, and brought to an end; they will not arise again. All wrong views concerning body and life, body and mind, and the nature of life itself cease completely from then on.  

The core of liberation lies in abandoning craving. When craving is completely extinguished, entirely cast aside, and one is freed from it, no longer clinging to any object, this state is called “putting down the burden”—letting go of all heavy loads and bonds.  

Only by reaching a true and complete understanding of the attraction, the danger, and the path of liberation regarding each of the six objects can a practitioner realize unsurpassed awakening, attain complete liberation of the heart, and no longer be bound by birth and death. When he has fully understood the sweetness, the peril, and the escape with regard to the six sense bases, he can declare that he has attained unsurpassed perfect awakening, and he knows that his mind is liberated. He is certain that this is his last life, that there will be no future rebirth and no further cycle of existence at all. At that point he abides in the “final body,” having completed ultimate liberation, and henceforth is not bound by any form of birth and death.  

Among the various ways of liberation of mind, “imperturbable liberation of mind” is regarded as the most excellent state. Among the immeasurable liberation of mind, the nothingness liberation of mind, and the signless liberation of mind, the imperturbable liberation of mind is called the foremost and most sublime. This imperturbable mind is no longer shaken by greed, hatred, or delusion. Its very nature is emptiness free of sensual desire, emptiness free of ill will, and emptiness free of delusion—a thoroughly pure and steady state, no longer agitated by waves of defilement.  

When the practitioner’s mind is without clinging or entanglement, has transcended the assaults of Māra’s armies, and abides in the position of the final body, he truly stands on the summit of ultimate liberation.  

VI. The Perfection of the Faculties and the Inner and Outer Marks of Genuine Attainment  

If a practitioner can fully carry out the contemplation of the arising and passing of the six sense faculties, and practise all the way to the realization of liberating wisdom—without obstruction through the whole course—then his faculties are said to be “brought to perfection.” This does not merely mean that the physical senses are healthy; it means that, under the light of wisdom, the whole process of the six faculties—from arising of grasping to complete letting go, from being driven by objects to no longer being turned by them—has been brought to a flawless completion.  

When a practitioner thus contemplates the arising and passing of the six faculties and six objects, a noble disciple who has heard the teaching can thereby know the truth and personally experience the path of liberation.  

In the practitioner’s body and mind, genuine attainment naturally shows itself. A practitioner endowed with the marks of dignity often has a comely and pleasing appearance, a gentle and majestic bearing, and the most excellent, beautiful complexion. Yet such outer marks are only the natural expression of inner liberation. In his inner state he has already gone beyond all fetters of defilement, all yokes and impediments formed by clinging, and all bonds of the heart. His mind is free of attachment and entanglement, has transcended every disturbance of Māra’s armies, abides in the position of the final body, and has realized true freedom.  

The nature of genuine spiritual attainment has a particular feature of manifestation: it is real and cannot be concealed. The scriptures say that true spiritual attainment is like the body of a huge elephant, whereas false outward show is like a single leaf. Something so small cannot cover a great elephant’s body; likewise, small and superficial pretence cannot hide truly deep spiritual attainment.  

Therefore, in assessing someone’s spiritual level, one should take actual realization as the standard. Those who have not realized should not claim to possess such attainments; those who have realized will naturally know and realize for themselves as they are, without needing to boast.  

Our attitude toward the attainment of others should also be correct. We should not look down on those who have genuinely attained, nor should we judge the depth of practice merely by outward appearance. Instead, we ought sincerely to respect all genuine spiritual attainments. Only when a practitioner has the complete understanding described above can he truly reach the goal of practice, realize awakening in this very life, and abide in a state of fulfillment. Without such understanding, he cannot reach the goal and will find it hard, in this life, to abide in complete realization.  

In the recognition granted by the community, the fruits of insight into feeling also manifest as a clear identity: when a practitioner fully understands the arising and cessation of all kinds of feeling, he will be acknowledged among ascetics as a true ascetic, and among brahmins as a true brahmin. On a higher level, when he reaches the most excellent purity, he may be called a true brahmin, no longer named by any external form, but only by his unsurpassed inner purity.  

As for noble ones who have already awakened, they are without sin and fault. Their minds do not fall through forgetfulness; they constantly maintain right mindfulness. The Buddha himself is the most complete example: throughout day and night, the Buddha is radiant. He was born in the world, surpasses the world, and is not stained by the world. This radiance is both a metaphor and a reality, symbolizing the inner and outer brightness of the awakened one.  

VII. Manifestations of Supernormal Powers, Liberation of Mind, and Deep Meditative States  

When practice reaches advanced stages, the practitioner may not only be complete in wisdom, but may also display various attainments in concentration and supernormal powers. An accomplished one can obtain great supernormal abilities, attaining them under the care and instruction of his teacher, thus perfectly completing the disciple’s right path.  

He can tame natural phenomena—for example, he can call forth a cool gentle breeze, or cause the peal of thunder to sound, or even bring down drops of rain to bring moisture. In the control of physical elements, he can release flames from a closed space and burn specific objects—such as a handful of grass—while at the same time protecting designated items—such as clothing—from any harm. These supernormal feats are not liberation in themselves, but they are one kind of manifestation of the fruits of practice.  

In terms of meditative attainment, the accomplished one can first surpass the base of infinite space and then realize and abide in the base of infinite consciousness. Going further, he can, according to the different ways of liberation of mind, cultivate the four liberations of mind and discern the differences between them.  

The liberation of mind through nothingness transcends the base of infinite consciousness and reaches and abides in the “nothingness” state. The empty liberation of mind is cultivated by reflecting, in solitude, that the nature of “I” and “what is mine” is utterly empty, with nothing truly obtainable. The signless liberation of mind is cultivated by not attending to any signs, not taking up any appearances, and thereby reaching and abiding in the concentration of the signless mind.  

The imperturbable liberation of mind is the common core and culmination of these liberations. Among the immeasurable liberation of mind, the nothingness liberation of mind, and the signless liberation of mind, the imperturbable liberation of mind is considered the foremost and most excellent. Its nature is emptiness free from sensual defilement, free from ill will, and free from delusion; the mind is no longer moved by the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion, and has truly reached a calm and unwavering purity.  

The fruits of practice also appear in accurate discrimination of levels of Dhamma. When wisdom is accomplished, the practitioner can see, as they are, the gradations of inferior, middling, and superior Dhammas, and clearly discern which teachings are low, which are middling, and which are excellent, and so he no longer takes things in a mistaken, inverted way.  

By cultivating and repeatedly practising mindfulness of breathing, four fundamental benefits can be obtained. First, it helps to cut off various fetters, so that the bonds that have long tied up the heart are gradually loosened and finally severed. Second, it helps to cut off forever the latent defilements deep within, those hidden tendencies that are usually hard to notice are uprooted in the union of concentration and wisdom. Third, it helps one to understand completely the process and course of life, to see clearly the whole trajectory from cause to effect, from arising to cessation. Fourth, it ultimately helps to bring all defilements to utter exhaustion, to eradicate completely the outflows of the mind, and to reach liberation free of all “leaks.”  

VIII. Unsurpassed Perfect Awakening, the Tathāgata’s Realm, and the Virtues of a Great Person  

When practice is fully completed, the resulting attainment is exceedingly majestic. The accomplished one not only has gone beyond all bad destinies and places of downfall, but has also reached the highest fullness in wisdom, virtue, and realization. He attains the Tathāgata’s realm, endowed with the perfect awakening and great compassion and great wisdom of a Tathāgata. He attains the status of “worthy of offerings,” becoming one who deserves the veneration and offerings of all people. At the same time, he attains the state of a perfectly awakened one, realizing right and complete awakening that is thorough and impartial, without deviation.  

Such a fruit is founded on firm view and complete understanding. The root of this firm view lies in deep contemplation and understanding of the Four Noble Truths: suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering. He knows what suffering is, what its cause is, what its cessation is, and what the way to its cessation is, and he clearly sees that he himself is walking on this right path. Once his view is firm, then no matter what arguments or challenges he encounters, nothing can shake his understanding.  

He knows that those with complete understanding can reach the goal of practice and, in this present life, realize and abide in fulfillment; those without complete understanding cannot reach the goal and cannot, in this life, realize and abide in that fulfillment.  

On this path to awakening, there are also actual examples of those who have already attained liberation. For instance, practitioners such as Youbojia, Boluojiantuo, Fujiuzuodi, Batiyejiantuo, Zhuopo, Pohoula, Qipinqiye, and others are examples of liberated ones. Their attainments prove that liberation is not an abstract notion, but something that actual persons can realize for themselves.  

More broadly, the accomplishment of the seven wholesome qualities, the accomplishment of the four qualities, the pacification of the five kinds of fear and hostility together with the fulfillment of the four factors of stream‑entry, and skilful contemplation of the noble truths and full penetration of the meanings of the Dhamma—all lead to the same result: if one so wishes, one can personally know and remember that hell, the animal realm, the realm of hungry ghosts, evil births, bad destinies, and places of downfall have all ended; one has attained the fruit of stream‑entry, the causes of downfall are destroyed, and one is definitely headed toward perfect awakening.  

With the additional support of the Dhamma‑mirror teaching, the fruit becomes even more stable; all states that could lead to downfall are utterly destroyed, and one reaches the stage of non‑regression, moving straight toward perfect right awakening.  

A defining characteristic running through all these attainments is that the practitioner’s mind is completely liberated. He is no longer troubled by any useless affliction, is far beyond the threat of the bad destinies of hell, animals, and hungry ghosts, has complete understanding of the delight, the danger, and the escape with respect to the six faculties and six objects, has deep direct vision and understanding of the Four Noble Truths, and has clear contemplation of the four kinds of nutriment and the conditions that bind life.  

He can, in his present life, personally realize and know the truth of reality, abide in the state of ultimate liberation, and know for certain that this life is his last, with no future rebirth.  

Only such a one, whose mind is liberated, truly deserves to be called a great person. One whose mind is not liberated, no matter what external forms and titles he has, cannot be called a true great person. When he also displays, in wisdom, great wisdom, broad wisdom, vast wisdom, deep wisdom, unequalled wisdom, great‑expanse wisdom, much wisdom, quick wisdom, nimble wisdom, keen wisdom, rapid wisdom, sharp wisdom, and discriminating wisdom; when he reaches the most excellent purity and becomes a true brahmin, transcending all external forms; and when, in body and mind, he is free from all fetters and bonds and abides in the imperturbable liberation of mind—then what he has realized is precisely the Tathāgata’s realm, the realm of one worthy of offerings, and the realm of a perfectly awakened one.  

Thus it is clear that the fruits of practice are not merely a small measure of psychological comfort, but a complete achievement stretching from virtue, concentration, and wisdom to liberation and the knowledge and vision of liberation.  

They bring a realization of the Dhamma that can be directly verified in this very life; they bring the total cutting off of craving and bondage; they free one forever from the bad destinies of hell, animals, and hungry ghosts; they unfold the radiance of wisdom and the completeness of right view; and they culminate in the state of the final body, where the heart is completely liberated and no longer constrained by the round of birth and death.
