<title> The Teachings Between Teacher and Disciple and the Way for the True Dharma to Abide Long </title>
<article>
I. The Teacher’s Kindness and the Disciple’s Attainments  
A disciple’s attainment of vast, all‑encompassing knowledge and understanding does not rely solely on personal effort; it depends deeply on the teacher’s instruction and care. The disciple’s achievement of great, pervasive wisdom is the result of the teacher’s extraordinary kindness. Precisely because there is a good teacher who expounds and guides with the true Dharma, the disciple can advance step by step in practice and understanding, and ultimately perfect the wisdom and realization he or she seeks. There is an inseparable causal relationship between such attainment and the teacher’s kindness.

II. The Responsibility to Instruct and the Difficulties of Our Time  

II.1 The Shared Responsibility to Instruct  
On the path of practice, the work of instruction is not the responsibility of one person or a small number of people alone; it is an obligation that all practitioners should jointly bear. Every practitioner, within the scope of his or her own ability, should admonish other practitioners and explain the Dharma to them. Such mutual encouragement and mutual guidance allow the true Dharma to continue within the community of monastics and householders, and help more people enter the correct path of practice. Those who teach the Dharma and those who listen to the Dharma should naturally form a relationship of shared attainment, rather than standing apart from one another.

II.2 The Resistance of Contemporary Practitioners  
However, in today’s practice environment, obvious difficulties have arisen in receiving instruction and guidance. Many contemporary practitioners harbor a resistant attitude toward others’ teaching; when others offer admonition, correction, or exhortation, they often find it hard to accept with a joyful and willing heart. This resistance not only makes instruction difficult, it also prevents good spiritual friends from exercising their proper function. The result is that, although some are willing to teach and to remind others, they are troubled because the other party refuses to accept it, and thus a relationship that should be mutually supportive in practice instead produces distance and conflict.

II.3 How Instruction Affects the Success or Failure of the Holy Life  

II.3.1 The Positive Cycle of Right Instruction  
In an ideal situation, correct and upright guidance gives rise to a positive cycle within the monastic community and the wider circle of practitioners. When young practitioners see worthy examples, they naturally give rise to the wish to emulate the virtuous, and take the initiative to learn the excellent qualities found in their seniors. If elders and seniors themselves possess pure holy conduct (brahmacarya) and good character, the young will, by constant exposure, imitate these qualities. As they continually progress, they will in time also be respected by elders and fellow practitioners—and this respect does not come from fame and gain, but is grounded in genuine virtue. In this way, both for individuals and for the community, long‑term benefit and genuine happiness arise, accomplishing good for oneself and for others.

II.3.2 The Negative Cycle of Wrong Instruction  
Conversely, if elders and seniors lack real practice and only value reputation and various material requisites, neglecting pure holy conduct and inner cultivation, then they themselves become a kind of wrong “instruction.” Young practitioners, observing those who came before, will often directly imitate their way of acting. If what they see is an atmosphere that cares only about fame, status, and material offerings, they will assume that this is what practitioners ought to pursue. As a result, the younger generation also learns to chase after fame, gain, and external conditions, and no longer focuses on the essential practices of virtue, concentration, and wisdom. When such wrong examples are constantly copied and transmitted, the overall atmosphere of practice will deviate from the true path, bringing long‑term harm and suffering. Outwardly things may appear to flourish, yet inwardly they have departed from the true spirit of the holy life.

II.3.3 The Root of Obstacles to the Holy Life  
In such circumstances, even those who truly live the genuine holy life often become troubled and vexed by the various flaws that arise within that very holy life. These flaws do not come from the holy life itself, but from mistaken ways of instruction and from distorted prevailing attitudes. When methods of instruction are off course, or when elders present wrong views and unwholesome behavior, these errors become major obstacles on the path. Thus, those who sincerely wish to follow the true Dharma must struggle forward amid these hindrances. One can say that wrong modes of instruction themselves become one of the roots that obstruct the holy life and damage practice, forcing true practitioners of the holy life to endure difficulties that should not have been there.

III. Norms for Teacher–Disciple Interaction and Guidance in Practice  

III.1 The Etiquette of Asking and Responding  
In the interaction between teacher and disciple, the way of asking questions and responding must be founded on respect and proper measure. When a disciple asks the teacher about the meaning of the Dharma or methods of practice, he or she should maintain an attitude of full respect—never casual or irreverent—but seek instruction with a correct mind and humble speech. This respect is not a mere formality; it is an expression of cherishing the true Dharma and the good spiritual friend. Correspondingly, when a teacher responds to the disciple’s questions, he or she should clearly express their view, not speak ambiguously, and not leave the disciple still doubtful and uneasy concerning crucial matters. Both teacher and disciple must maintain proper measure in their interaction: the disciple does not overstep bounds, and the teacher does not lose dignity. In this way, the whole process of question and answer both accords with etiquette and truly resolves problems in practice.

III.2 The Concrete Manner of Giving Practice Guidance  
In specific guidance for practice, the teacher’s instruction to the disciple should proceed step by step. It must not be hasty, nor should an excessive amount of content be poured in all at once. One should begin from the level that the disciple can currently understand and put into practice, leading him or her gradually deeper. For practices or methods that require demonstration, the teacher’s demonstration should be as clear and definite as possible so that the disciple can see and learn, thereby avoiding misunderstanding and wrong practice caused by vague explanation. When a given stage of instruction has been completed, the teacher should clearly mark a conclusion, so that the disciple knows that this stage of learning is fulfilled and can then move on to the next. Such teaching, with clear beginnings and endings and distinct stages, helps the disciple to consolidate what has been learned and keeps practice from becoming confused and disorderly.

IV. Expounding the Dharma Methods and the Efficacy of Hearing the Dharma  

IV.1 The Recipients of Instruction  
When preaching and propagating the Dharma methods, the recipients are not limited to a single group; both monastics and laypeople, men and women alike, are included. Specifically, one should expound the Dharma to bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās. Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs are monks and nuns who have left home to practice; upāsakas and upāsikās are male and female lay disciples who practice while remaining householders. These four kinds of disciples all bear and embody the true Dharma; therefore, they should be the main objects of Dharma instruction so that all may benefit from hearing.

IV.2 The Role of Hearing the Dharma in Cutting Off Doubt  
When these recipients hear the Dharma spoken by the Tathāgata, a crucial effect can occur: anyone who formerly had fear or doubt regarding the Tathāgata can, by hearing the Dharma, cut off that fear and doubt. Whether their uncertainty concerns the Tathāgata’s virtues, the truth of his teaching, or the viability of the path of practice, as long as anxiety and suspicion remain, faith and implementation will be affected. Through the true Dharma spoken by the Tathāgata, they obtain confirmation both in reasoning and in direct experience, and thus can put down all fear and doubt about the Tathāgata, settling into firm and unshakable faith. Hearing the Dharma is not only a matter of adding knowledge; it is a vital condition for removing inner obstacles and establishing right faith.

V. The Four Establishments of Mindfulness and the Continuance of the True Dharma  

V.1 A Cause of the True Dharma’s Failure to Remain Long  
Whether the true Dharma can be transmitted in the world for a long time is directly related to whether beings practice certain Dharma methods. Among these, the practice or non‑practice of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness (body, feelings, mind, and phenomena) is one key factor. If beings do not cultivate the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and lack realistic observation of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, they are easily controlled by afflictions and deluded views. When they not only fail to practice the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, but also fail to practice and train repeatedly in this method, the true Dharma cannot easily abide long in the world. The reason is that, although the Dharma still exists in the words of the scriptures, if no one practices and realizes it, over time the spirit of the true Dharma will gradually disappear amid empty formalism. Thus, one cause of the true Dharma’s failure to remain long is precisely that the Four Establishments of Mindfulness are neither practiced nor extensively and deeply cultivated.

V.2 A Cause of the True Dharma’s Long Abiding  
Conversely, if there are those who are willing to follow the teaching and truly cultivate the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, and not only practice them occasionally but repeatedly and diligently, applying this method continually in daily life and meditative contemplation, then the true Dharma can abide long in the world. When the Four Establishments of Mindfulness become a widespread and solid foundation for practitioners, the true Dharma does not remain merely at the level of words; it is vividly manifested in conduct, mental states, and contemplative insight. Practice centered on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness allows the true Dharma to be transmitted from generation to generation without interruption. Therefore, the cultivation and intensive cultivation of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is an important reason why the true Dharma can remain long in the world.

V.3 The Supportive Condition of Admonition Among Relatives and Friends  
Apart from one’s own effort in study and practice, mutual exhortation among relatives and friends is also an important supporting means for practicing the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. Faced with one’s own relatives and close companions, if one can hold a mind of compassion and care for their long‑term welfare, rather than merely attending to short‑term, small benefits, one should kindly encourage them to cultivate the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. Such exhortation is not coercion; it is a compassionate reminder and invitation, hoping that they too, through realistic observation of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, will reduce afflictions and increase wisdom. When family members and friends, moved by compassion, mutually exhort one another so that more people enter the path of practicing the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, they thereby, invisibly, provide firm supportive conditions for the continuance of the true Dharma.

VI. The Selection of Teaching Content and the Four Factors of Stream‑Entry  

VI.1 The Principles for Selecting What to Teach  
Among the many possible teachings that could be expounded, not every kind of content must, nor does every kind of content deserve to be taught to the public one by one. In general, the teachings that have been realized but not explained are extremely numerous, far exceeding the portion actually spoken. The reason they are not explained is not that these Dharma methods are entirely without value, but that they do not in fact help with liberation. Out of compassionate concern for beings’ path to liberation, only those teachings that truly lead to liberation are selected for exposition, while those that do not aid liberation are put aside. This principle of selection ensures that the content of Dharma preaching does not become miscellaneous and disorderly, but points directly toward liberation and purity.

VI.2 Exhorting Relatives and Friends to Practice the Four Factors of Stream‑Entry  
Within the concrete content of instruction, there is another highly meaningful guideline for the relatives and friends we care about: to exhort them to cultivate the four factors of stream‑entry. For relatives and friends whom one holds in one’s heart, wishing them benefit and happiness, one should encourage and urge them to practice these four key factors that lead to the fruit of stream‑entry. Such exhortation does not arise from selfish motives; it is for their long‑term welfare, so that they may not only obtain merit and good fortune in this life, but also progress toward the path of liberation. When a person truly cares for his or her relatives and friends, he or she does more than provide material or emotional support, and also hopes they will gain a refuge in the Dharma. Therefore, guiding relatives and friends to cultivate the four factors of stream‑entry is a concrete expression of caring for them and enabling them to obtain great benefit.

In summary, from the wisdom realized through the teacher’s kindness, the responsibility and difficulties of giving instruction, the positive and negative cycles created by right and wrong examples, the etiquette of teacher–disciple interaction, the preaching to the four assemblies and the role of hearing the Dharma in cutting off doubt, the connection between the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and the long abiding of the true Dharma, and the selection of teaching content together with exhortation of relatives and friends, all of these show that correct instruction and practice are the key to personal liberation and to the true Dharma’s remaining in the world. Only when teachers and disciples each abide properly in their roles, and beings are willing to hear the Dharma, practice it, and encourage one another, can the true Dharma continue to shine forth in the world for a long time.
