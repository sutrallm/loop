I. Fundamental Bearing of Noble Ones and Liberated Ones

The basic qualities of a noble one in practice are first manifested in moral discipline and in bodily and mental conduct. A trainee in the Dhamma can maintain pure precepts; because of keeping precepts, body and mind become tranquil, and he is not negligent in behavior and speech. He chooses the monastic life and lives in ease and contentment, being easily satisfied and having few desires regarding robes, food, lodging, and medicine. With the ease and contentment of a renunciant, he walks the path.

Inwardly he delights in cultivation, taking practice as his joy day and night. At all times he settles his mind on the Dhamma, taking delight in the unremitting cultivation of wholesome states throughout day and night. Due to long-term training, his sense faculties become calmed; the six faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind no longer turn and follow after external objects. Thus he can break through the net of death and is no longer ensnared by the web of birth and death. Such a noble one takes joy in walking the perilous path, willingly facing the difficult road of liberation rather than seeking a comfortable and easy path.

A noble one dwelling and practicing in a pure sacred place is often regarded as a model, an object of reverence and worship for all practicing disciples. By leading through example and abiding in a pure place, they demonstrate through actual conduct the bearing of a liberated one, and thus naturally receive the disciples’ respect and veneration. Among practitioners, the foremost practitioner is described as the most excellent person, able to defeat the assaults of Māra’s hosts and not be shaken by various internal and external demonic conditions. For such a practitioner, this mode of existence is his final life; there will be no further rounds of rebirth in saṃsāra.

The liberated one is also called “the Comer” (the One-Who-Has-Come), and his state is described through a series of symbolic expressions. He is said to possess flawless moral conduct, with no defect or breach in his precepts, pure and undefiled as if covered in white. He is also likened to a single-spoked wheel, simple and unentangled in inner structure, yet able to turn, indicating that his path of practice and liberation can truly operate and take effect. This liberated one has cut off craving and no longer has the stream of grasping desire. Being without bondage, he has released all inner and outer fetters and is at the same time far removed from suffering, no longer oppressed or constrained by it.

From another angle, the concrete qualities of a liberated one can be divided into several aspects: first, “without suffering,” that is, he has cut off all roots of suffering; second, “cutting off the stream,” meaning he has severed the stream of craving so that the river of defilements no longer surges forth; third, “without bondage,” meaning he has completely removed all fetters and the mind is no longer tied down; and fourth, “the Comer,” here specifically referring to an arahant. Taken together, because the liberated one’s moral conduct is flawless, he abides in liberation; his mind is endowed with right mindfulness, he can act freely and unimpeded, having cut craving and being free of bondage, and being far from suffering. Therefore he is called “one who has seen the Comer”: to see such a liberated one is tantamount to beholding the very reality of liberation.

II. Criteria and Stages of Practice

In assessing a person’s level of practice, one must first grasp a basic principle: it is impossible to determine whether someone is an arahant, or whether he possesses the path to arahantship, merely from external appearances and living conditions. Some live at home, enjoy sense pleasures, and possess wealth and comfortable material conditions, yet the true state of their inner mind is difficult for others to know directly. Hence, one must not deny a person’s spiritual attainment simply because he lives in abundance or enjoys sensual pleasures, nor should one affirm that someone has reached ultimate liberation merely because he appears austere and lives a frugal and simple life.

With respect to stages of practice, there is a clear and essential difference between trainees and one who is fully liberated. Trainee-practitioners are still in the process of eliminating the five hindrances. They are still striving to counter and purify the hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of sloth-and-torpor, the hindrance of restlessness-and-remorse, and the hindrance of doubt. In contrast, one who is fully liberated has completely eradicated the five hindrances; these five obstructions are no longer operative in his mind. Therefore, in terms of practice, there is indeed an essential distinction between the two and they should not be conflated.

On the level of cognition, there also exists an intermediate state. Someone may recognize that within the five aggregates subject to clinging there indeed appears a phenomenon that can be called “self,” and may understand that sentient beings have the experience of self-view arising based on the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. Yet he does not cling to this phenomenon as a truly existent, unchanging “self.” He no longer produces firm attachment toward this “there is a self” phenomenon, but instead knows it as it really is, merely as a phenomenon. However, this cognitive state of not clinging to a “self” has still not reached the ultimate fruit of the arahant, whose taints are exhausted. It still belongs to a stage in which defilements have not been entirely eliminated.

In the description of complete cognition, one who has attained complete cognition is defined as a noble one who has realized the fruit of arahantship. That is to say, truly complete and fully accurate knowing-and-seeing ultimately takes arahantship as its mark; only with the realization of arahantship can one be said to have truly completed full cognition.

In terms of the practice of the four establishments of mindfulness, arahants and those whose taints are destroyed are often especially skilful in cultivating these four foundations. They are usually adept at binding the mind to the object in body contemplation, feeling contemplation, mind contemplation, and Dhamma contemplation, keeping the mind firmly fixed on the object at hand, neither scattered nor forgetful. In this way they reveal the close relationship between ultimate attainment and the four establishments of mindfulness.

Regarding the highest fruit in the stages of practice, there is a type of practitioner who possesses firm faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, generating an unwavering confidence in the Three Jewels. At the same time, he possesses quick wisdom and sharp wisdom; in understanding and insight he is extremely swift and incisive, not dull or sluggish. Such a person, in accordance with the actual state of the taints having been exhausted, can in this very life realize taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and in this present existence attain the twofold ultimate of liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom.

III. The Attainment Structure of the Saṅgha and Types of Bhikkhus

Taken as a whole, the Saṅgha is described as a faultless collective, a community composed of noble ones who have cut the fetters of defilement. Among this Saṅgha there are many arahants who are no longer subject to any future existence; they will no longer undergo continued rebirth in the round of saṃsāra, and their liberation is already decided.

Within such a Saṅgha, one can clearly see concrete classifications. One type is the “possessor of the three true knowledges”: they possess three kinds of knowledge that surpass the ordinary cognition of worldlings, the so-called three true knowledges. Another type is the “possessor of the six superknowledges,” endowed with six kinds of supernormal powers and able to manifest abilities that exceed ordinary people on many levels. In addition, there are “both-ways-liberated ones,” liberated from both the side of concentration and the side of wisdom: they are free and unhindered in the dimension of meditative absorption and have also cut off defilements on the side of wisdom. In contrast to them, there are “wisdom-liberated ones,” who are liberated mainly by wisdom; though they need not have the same depth of liberation in meditative absorption, their wisdom is sufficient to cut off the fetters of defilement.

In the context of practicing the path of liberation, bhikkhus are classified into three standards according to their grasp and implementation of the teaching. If a bhikkhu can, regarding a particular Dhamma, clearly expound the path of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to it—able to teach skillfully in words, instructing others how to generate disenchantment toward that Dhamma, how to become dispassionate toward it, and how to move toward its cessation—such a bhikkhu is called a “Dhamma-preaching bhikkhu.”

If a bhikkhu not only understands, but actually puts into practice disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation regarding a particular Dhamma—conforming in body and mind to the teaching, practicing accordingly, and following after the Dhamma—he is called a “bhikkhu who practices in accordance with the Dhamma and follows the Dhamma.”

If a bhikkhu goes yet further and, through disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to a particular Dhamma, arrives at non-clinging so that his mind is liberated and he realizes Nibbāna in this very life, such a bhikkhu is called a “bhikkhu who has attained Nibbāna in this very life.”

From the common ground of liberation, those who achieve liberation are not limited to only one type. A perfectly enlightened one attains liberation by means of a certain specific method; by that same method a wisdom-liberated one also attains liberation. That is, this method is equally effective for the perfectly enlightened one and for the wisdom-liberated one, enabling both to achieve liberation. On the other hand, practitioners who, through cultivation, successfully cross over to the further shore and stand on firm ground there are explicitly identified as noble ones who have realized the fruit of arahantship. The ability to cross from the near shore of birth and death to the further shore of liberation, and to stand firm and unmoving on the solid ground of that further shore, is a symbolic description of the fruit of arahantship.

IV. The Real Accomplishments of Arahants and Noble Disciples

Among the Buddha’s disciples there are many arahants endowed with specific and clearly defined accomplishments. Many among them have realized the three true knowledges, possessing clear and complete knowledge and vision regarding the past, the future, and liberation. At the same time, they possess supernormal powers, able in some respects to surpass the limitations of ordinary sense faculties. These arahants are also highly skilful in knowing the minds of others, clearly discerning the states present in others’ minds. Most importantly, they have reached the state in which the defilements are exhausted: all tainted defilements in their minds have completely dried up and no longer arise.

With respect to concrete achievements in practice, when a practitioner truly succeeds, he knows and sees as it really is that “birth is ended”: he knows that the round of rebirth in this life has come to its final limit. At the same time, “the holy life has been fully established,” meaning that his pure holy life has been completely and firmly consummated; “what had to be done has been done,” indicating that all the tasks of practice that should be accomplished—all that needed to be completed—have been thoroughly fulfilled; and “there is no more of this to come,” meaning he will not undergo any new future existence and will not take a new rebirth. On this basis he attains arahantship and is definitively established in the fruit of arahantship.

Looking at the route by which the state of liberation is achieved, the description of successful practice becomes even more comprehensive. When the holy life is fully realized, the practitioner has completely cut off birth and death and is no longer drawn along by the round of rebirth. He can know directly and realize for himself—personally experience and personally verify—the reality of liberation, not merely hear about it or reflect on it conceptually. In this way he reaches ultimate liberation, truly realizing the fruit of arahantship and completing all that should be done, both in the worldly and the supramundane domain; therefore he no longer undergoes future existence, and the continuity of birth and death comes to an end.

In defining the fruit of arahantship, an arahant is described as the foremost and most excellent in this world, the most noble and outstanding among people; thus he is called an arahant. The arahant possesses many distinct qualities: his craving has left no trace—sensual love and grasping desire have completely disappeared without leaving even the slightest mark; conceit has been cut off—he no longer abides in conceit, holding no views of superiority, inferiority, or equality; the net of delusion has been torn apart—the mesh of ignorance no longer covers his mind; his heart has moved far away from defilement, inwardly pure and unpolluted, and therefore he is called “undefiled.”

On the level of wisdom, he fully knows the five aggregates, seeing with complete and thorough understanding the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. In terms of the stage of training, he has generated the “knowledge of one beyond training” (non-learner’s knowledge): he no longer needs further learning to cut off defilements, for all that should be cut off has been cut off, and all that should be known has been known. For him, this one body is indeed the “last body”; after the end of this life there will be no new body. Confronting the manifold conditions of the world—above, below, and in the four directions—he has absolutely no rejoicing in any direction, no delighting attachment anywhere; at the same time, he has no fear or terror regarding anything in the world, is not intimidated by any worldly phenomenon, and remains inwardly stable and unafraid.

Viewed as a group, the ultimately liberated ones who, through the exhaustion of the taints, realize in this present life taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom also belong to this class of fully accomplished noble ones. They possess firm faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and they have attained quick and sharp wisdom, swiftly and incisively penetrating the truth. They are able to utterly cut off all tainted defilements and thus, in this very life, complete the perfection of liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom.

V. The Culmination of Liberation and Complete Cognition

Among those who have achieved liberation, the perfectly enlightened one and the wisdom-liberated ones both attain liberation by the same method, showing that the path of liberation has a common and universal basis. This path is in fact the shared road leading to arahantship and to all liberated ones. Practitioners who have successfully crossed to the further shore and stand upon solid ground there are precisely the noble ones who have realized the fruit of arahantship: they no longer dwell on the unsettled and turbulent near shore of birth and death but instead stand securely on the firm ground of liberation on the far shore.

In a broader sense, those who have attained complete cognition are explicitly identified as noble ones who have realized the fruit of arahantship. They possess complete and accurate knowledge and vision with regard to the five aggregates, to self-clinging, and to birth-and-death and Nibbāna, with no remaining deviation or confusion. By contrast, those who, although knowing that within the five aggregates subject to clinging there appears the phenomenon “there is a self,” no longer cling to this “there is a self” as a truly existing self, are still at a stage short of being arahants with exhausted taints; they must continue to deepen their practice and contemplation until defilements are completely eradicated.

As for trainee-practitioners, although they are already progressing along the path of eliminating the five hindrances, they are still struggling with the obstructions of sensual desire, ill will, sloth-and-torpor, restlessness-and-remorse, and doubt. The ultimately liberated ones, however, have completely cut off the five hindrances. The difference in their mental state and level of realization lies precisely in whether they have truly eradicated defilements and attained taintless liberation.

To summarize the above, the accomplishments of noble ones and arahants encompass purity of moral discipline; the joint cultivation of concentration and wisdom; firm faith in the Three Jewels; skilful cultivation of the four establishments of mindfulness; complete cognition regarding the five aggregates and self-clinging; and total liberation from the round of birth and death. They are the faultless company of noble ones, arahants who will no longer undergo future existence, “Comers” who have cut off craving, removed all fetters, and are far from suffering, and they are the pure exemplars whom all practicing disciples revere and venerate. </article>
