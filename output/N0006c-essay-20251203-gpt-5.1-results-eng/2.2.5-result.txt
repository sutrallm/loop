I. The Fundamental Meaning and Structure of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power

I.1 The Four Bases of Spiritual Power as a Path of Practice From This Shore to the Other Shore  
The Four Bases of Spiritual Power are regarded as a fundamental path of practice that can aid practitioners in going from this shore to the other shore. If one cultivates and extensively cultivates the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, one can not only proceed from the shore of birth and death toward the other shore of liberation, but also enter upon the path that leads to the complete extinction of all suffering and distress. If a practitioner can cultivate and frequently cultivate the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, he or she can gradually attain the state of a noble one, escape all bonds of the world, and correctly head toward the complete cessation of all suffering and distress.

I.2 The Basic Definition and Multiple Explanations of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power  
The so‑called Four Bases of Spiritual Power basically refer to four kinds of “bases of spiritual power that are the accomplishment of energetic practice in samādhi,” namely: the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in desire‑samādhi; the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in energy‑samādhi; the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in mind‑samādhi; and the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in investigation‑samādhi. At the same time, they are also explained as four kinds of meditation and practice established on different bases:  

Desire‑base (欲神足) is meditation and practice based on desire or aspiration; it is samādhi cultivated relying on desire, taking aspiration as its basis, and is also called “the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in desire‑samādhi.”  

Energy‑base (勤神足) is meditation and practice based on energy or vigorous effort; it is samādhi cultivated relying on diligence, taking energetic striving as its basis, and is also called “the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in energy‑samādhi.”  

Mind‑base (心神足) is meditation and practice based on mind; it is samādhi cultivated relying on the mind, taking mental focus as its basis, and is also called “the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in mind‑samādhi.”  

Investigation‑base (觀神足) is meditation and practice based on contemplative wisdom or insight; it is samādhi cultivated relying on observation, taking wise investigation as its basis, and is also called “the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in investigation‑samādhi.”

In a more concrete explanation, the Four Bases of Spiritual Power are also defined as four samādhis attained through vigorous practice: samādhi that is cultivated on the basis of desire and attained through energetic practice; samādhi that is cultivated on the basis of energy and attained through energetic practice; samādhi that is cultivated on the basis of mind and attained through energetic practice; and samādhi that is cultivated on the basis of investigation and attained through energetic practice. Together, these four form the fundamental conditions and path for accomplishing the majesty of supernormal powers, obtaining spiritual power, and even reaching ultimate liberation.

I.3 The Union of Samādhi and the Accomplishment of Energetic Practice  
In cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, two major factors must be present simultaneously. First, one must cultivate samādhi based on one specific foundation among desire, energy, mind, and investigation, allowing the mind to reach one‑pointedness and thereby accomplish the corresponding samādhi—that is, attain desire‑samādhi, energy‑samādhi, mind‑samādhi, or investigation‑samādhi. Second, upon this samādhi one must put energetic practice into effect, using energetic practice to deal with wholesome and unwholesome phenomena. When these two combine, the corresponding basis of spiritual power is accomplished; that is to say, any samādhi accomplished on the basis of desire, energy, mind, or investigation, once paired with energetic practice, becomes the corresponding basis of spiritual power. From this it is clear that the accomplishment of samādhi and the implementation of energetic practice are two indispensable aspects that together constitute the Four Bases of Spiritual Power.

II. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power in Relation to the Noble Path, Liberation, and Nirvāṇa

II.1 The Relationship Between the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and Gaining or Losing the Noble Path  
The Four Bases of Spiritual Power have an extremely close relationship with the noble path that leads to the end of suffering. To lose the Four Bases of Spiritual Power is effectively to lose the noble path leading to the end of suffering; conversely, to obtain the Four Bases of Spiritual Power is to gain the crucial support that leads to the noble path of the ending of suffering. Furthermore, in the past, present, and future, all practitioners who have reached the exhaustion of the taints and attained liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom share a common characteristic: they have cultivated and mastered the Four Bases of Spiritual Power. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power are therefore regarded as a path that must be traversed in order to correctly reach the noble path and the cessation of suffering.

II.2 The Function of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power in Liberation and Liberation of Mind and Wisdom  
The benefits brought by cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power encompass all key stages in the movement from an ordinary person toward liberation. Cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power can help practitioners attain seven stages of liberation, which are, in sequence: constant revulsion, dispassion, extinction, tranquility, realization of knowledge, equanimous awakening, and nirvāṇa. It is also said that cultivating and extensively practicing the Four Bases of Spiritual Power enables a person to bring all taints to an end, obtain taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and personally know and realize this in the present life, abiding in a complete and fulfilled state.

In another formulation, the accomplishment of the cultivation of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power enables practitioners to experience many kinds of supernormal manifestations, and in turn reach the exhaustion of all taints, completing liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom. Other discourses emphasize that in the past, present, and future, all who attain the exhaustion of the taints and achieve liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, without exception, rely commonly on the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and accomplish their realization by cultivating and mastering them. Thus it is evident that there is a direct and intimate connection between the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and ultimate liberation.

II.3 The Four Bases of Spiritual Power as Leading to Nirvāṇa and the Complete Cutting Off of Desire  
In expounding the aim of practice, it is stated that the ultimate purpose of practice is to completely cut off desire, and this purpose can be achieved through cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power. At the outset of practice, desire, energy, mind, and investigation must function as the driving forces in the quest for realization of the fruits: the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in desire‑samādhi takes the desire to attain realization as its driving force; the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in energy‑samādhi takes the energy to attain realization as its driving force; the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in mind‑samādhi takes the mind directed to attaining realization as its driving force; and the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in investigation‑samādhi takes the investigation aimed at attaining realization as its driving force. When practitioners attain the fruit of arahantship, these motivating desire, energy, mind, and investigation naturally come to an end, and desire is completely cut off. It is further said that the efficacy of cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power necessarily tends toward nirvāṇa and directly leads to the state of nirvāṇa.

III. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power, Spiritual Power, Supernormal Powers, Majesty, and Miraculous Transformations

III.1 The Connection Between the Bases of Spiritual Power and Spiritual Power, Supernormal Powers, and Great Majesty  
In discussing supernormal powers and majesty, the discourses clearly state that the bases of spiritual power are the fundamental foundation and path for obtaining spiritual power, that is, for experiencing many kinds of miraculous manifestations. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power are defined as the fundamental method for accomplishing supernormal powers, majesty, and ultimate liberation. The excellent accomplishments that result from cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power include obtaining great supernormal powers and great majesty, receiving the ability to display many kinds of miraculous transformations, and, through the reach of one’s bodily majesty, arriving at the Brahmā‑world, ultimately bringing all taints and afflictions to complete liberation.

It is also said that all those who possess great supernormal powers and great majesty, whether in the past, present, or future, achieve this through cultivating and extensively cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power; this principle applies universally to all practitioners in the three times. On the other hand, all those in the past, present, and future who are able to fully accomplish the bases of spiritual power, without exception, do so through cultivating and extensively cultivating these four bases. That practitioners obtain various supernormal powers through cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power is also explicitly pointed out, showing that there is a necessary relationship between the bases of spiritual power and various supernormal phenomena.

III.2 The Nature, Structure, and Proper Path of the Bases of Spiritual Power  
The term “basis of spiritual power” (神足) first refers to the road and foundation by which one can achieve spiritual power and obtain spiritual power. Thus, the nature of the attainment of the bases of spiritual power is further analyzed into several constituent factors: first is spiritual power itself, that is, extraordinary supernormal abilities; second is the bases of spiritual power, meaning the foundations and methods for accomplishing supernormal powers; third is the cultivation of the bases of spiritual power, namely the actual practice of the methods that accomplish supernormal powers; and fourth is the proper path of cultivating the bases of spiritual power, that is, the correct way that leads to the accomplishment of supernormal powers. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power are precisely the core content on this proper path; each of them is directed by aspiration, energy, mental focus, or wise investigation, and is accomplished through meditation and energetic striving, and so they are called “the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in desire‑samādhi,” “the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in energy‑samādhi,” “the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in mind‑samādhi,” and “the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in investigation‑samādhi.”

In a synthesized account of the practice of the bases of spiritual power, it is further pointed out that all cultivation of the bases of spiritual power must incline toward the direction of renunciation, non‑desire, extinction, and letting go. That is to say, although the bases of spiritual power can accomplish supernormal powers and great majesty, their correct cultivation must necessarily incline toward the mind of renunciation, take non‑desire as its orientation, take extinction as its abiding place, and take letting go as its direction. Only under such a premise does the cultivation of the bases of spiritual power truly belong to the proper path that leads to liberation.

III.3 Many Kinds of Miraculous Transformations and Reaching the Brahmā‑World  
Regarding the excellent accomplishments of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, the discourses specifically mention that if one cultivates the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, one can obtain great supernormal powers and great majesty, receive the ability to perform many kinds of miraculous transformations, and, through the power of one’s bodily majesty, reach the Brahmā‑world. That is to say, the Four Bases of Spiritual Power are not only the foundational basis for the accomplishment of ordinary meditation, but can also serve as a bridge to the form realm and even the Brahmā‑world. However, all these functions of supernormal powers and majesty ultimately still take the complete liberation from all taints and afflictions as their final goal; thus, even though one can reach the Brahmā‑world, one never departs from the direction of renunciation, non‑desire, and extinction.

IV. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power as the Common Reliance of Practitioners in the Three Times

IV.1 The Common Foundation of All Accomplished Ones in the Three Times  
On the temporal level, the discourses repeatedly emphasize a universal principle: practitioners of the past, present, and future who can accomplish the bases of spiritual power and the majesty of supernormal powers do so by virtue of cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power. Whether they are those who have fully accomplished the bases of spiritual power, or noble ones who have already reached the exhaustion of the taints and attained liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, they all share one common characteristic across the three times of past, present, and future: they cultivate and extensively cultivate the Four Bases of Spiritual Power. This trans‑temporal universality makes the Four Bases of Spiritual Power the fundamental law and general principle upon which practitioners of the three times commonly rely.

IV.2 The Wisdom and Radiance That Arise From Cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power  
Regarding the wisdom benefits of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, it is specifically stated that cultivating any one of the bases of spiritual power that are the accomplishment of energetic practice in samādhi can, regarding those teachings one has not previously heard, give rise to five kinds of wisdom results. These five results are: the arising of “eye,” the arising of “knowledge,” the arising of “wisdom,” the arising of “brightness,” and the arising of “radiance.” That is to say, through cultivating the basis of spiritual power that is the accomplishment of energetic practice in desire‑samādhi, in energy‑samādhi, in mind‑samādhi, or in investigation‑samādhi, practitioners, with respect to teachings they have not previously heard, can give rise to a seeing like an eye, an understanding like knowledge, a discerning like wisdom, a clarity like brightness, and an illumination like radiance. The discourses repeatedly point out that all four of these bases of spiritual power are worthy of cultivation, and that once cultivated they can all give rise to such wisdom.

On another side, the description of a radiant mind is also closely related to the cultivation of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power. In instructions on the methods of practice, it is frequently emphasized that one should cultivate with a vast mind that is not entangled, so that the mind gives forth radiance and reaches a state of purity and brightness. Such a radiant mind is not only a sign of concentration, but also the foundation for the arising of wisdom, brightness, and radiance. The connection between the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and the five wisdom results as well as the radiant, pure mind is thus immediately apparent.

V. The Concrete Methods of Practicing the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and the Taming of the Mind

V.1 Cultivation and Extensive Cultivation: From the Beginner to Well‑Established Wholesome Fabrication  
In the methods for cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, the scriptures repeatedly put forward the requirements of “cultivation” and “extensive cultivation.” To cultivate the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, and to extensively cultivate the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, constitutes a basic principle of practice. To cultivate the bases of spiritual power is to cultivate the four kinds of samādhi—desire‑samādhi, energy‑samādhi, mind‑samādhi, and investigation‑samādhi; each must be brought to accomplishment through vigorous practice, and thus they are also called the four samādhis that are the accomplishment of energetic practice.

Furthermore, to accomplish the Four Bases of Spiritual Power in practice, one must also possess a series of deeper applications, such as cultivating and extensively cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, and making them a vehicle one rides upon and a ground one relies on, allowing them to be accomplished in accordance with conditions, to be long accumulated as habit, and to be well fashioned. That is to say, the cultivation of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power must not only be repeatedly nurtured over time, but must also be made into the vehicle and foundation for the workings of the mind, so that through long‑term habituation and skillful fabrication they come to be naturally accomplished. This progression—from cultivation to extensive cultivation, and further to making them a vehicle, a ground, something that is naturally accomplished, accumulated as habit, and well fashioned—constitutes a complete, step‑by‑step system of the practice of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power in both temporal extension and inner depth.

V.2 The Middle‑Way Principle of Balance: Neither Slackening Nor Forcing, Neither Constricted Nor Distracted  
The practice of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power must follow a principle of middle‑way balance. The scriptures explicitly state that in cultivating the bases of spiritual power that are the accomplishment of energetic practice in the four kinds of samādhi—desire, energy, mind, and investigation—the same principle should be followed: the mind should neither excessively withdraw nor be excessively strained; one must not be overly lax, nor may one overly coerce oneself. Internally, the mind should not be too tightly constrained and thus become cramped, nor should it scatter outward, chasing external objects.

In another exposition, this principle is expressed as: the mind should neither withdraw too much nor strive too intensely; it should neither be forcibly gathered within nor allowed to scatter outward and become confused. This mode of practice, in which the mind is kept in proper balance between inner and outer, neither slackening nor forcing, enables practitioners to find a proper equilibrium between tension and relaxation, avoiding both sinking into laziness and clinging to restlessness. In this way they abide in the middle path, thereby providing a stable psychological foundation for the accomplishment of samādhi and the bases of spiritual power.

V.3 Making Earlier and Later, Above and Below, Day and Night Alike, and Developing a Radiant, Pure Mind  
In addition to middle‑way balance, the cultivation of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power also requires a kind of equal contemplation of time and spatial orientations. The scriptures specifically state that one should “maintain the thought of before and after and dwell thus: the after like the before, the before like the after; above like below, below like above; night like day, day like night.” That is, practitioners should make the later thought like the earlier thought, the earlier thought like the later thought; the above like the below, the below like the above; night like day, and day like night. Such practice cultivates an awareness and abiding in which the relative distinctions of earlier and later, above and below, day and night, are harmonized into a single suchness, no longer binding the mind with relative discriminations.

Furthermore, in cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, one must practice with a vast, unentangled mind, developing a mind that gives forth light and a radiant, pure mental state. The scriptures restate this principle as: practice with a vast mind that is not bound, and develop a radiant, pure mind. Such a mind is not fettered by internal or external conditions, and at the same time possesses a luminous quality that illuminates all things. It is an indispensable mental state in the cultivation of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power. All four bases—whether desire‑samādhi, energy‑samādhi, mind‑samādhi, or investigation‑samādhi—must be cultivated in accordance with the middle‑way principle of balance and the principle of developing a radiant mind in order to be truly accomplished.

V.4 Energetic Practice in Dealing With Wholesome and Unwholesome Phenomena, and the Tendency Toward Renunciation, Non‑Desire, Extinction, and Letting Go  
In the general principles for the practice of the bases of spiritual power, there is special emphasis on the requirement of energetic practice in dealing with wholesome and unwholesome phenomena. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power are not only the accomplishment of meditation, but are also fundamental tools for engaging in energetic practice and dealing with wholesome and unwholesome phenomena. In cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, one must use the samādhi that has been accomplished together with energetic practice to tame and deal with various wholesome and unwholesome states, enabling the mind to gradually tend toward purity.

At the same time, in the synthesized account of the practice of the bases of spiritual power, it is clearly stated that all practice of the bases of spiritual power should incline toward renunciation, non‑desire, extinction, and letting go. That is to say, the direction of cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power must be toward renouncing the world, moving away from attachment to desire, tending toward extinction, and implementing letting go in bodily, verbal, and mental actions. This orientation ensures that the Four Bases of Spiritual Power do not become objects of attachment to supernormal powers and miraculous transformations, but instead become aids for cutting off attachment and moving toward ultimate liberation.

V.5 The Requirement of Continuous, Extensive, and Deep Cultivation  
As for the key points in method, the scriptures repeatedly demand that in cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power one must reach the level of “accomplishment of energetic practice”; that is, one cannot merely practice them intermittently or superficially, but must cultivate them continuously, extensively, and deeply. To cultivate the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and to repeatedly and frequently cultivate them is one of the core principles of practice for the bases of spiritual power. It is further stated that one must cultivate and extensively cultivate the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, and systematically cultivate the four samādhis that are the accomplishment of energetic practice. Only such systematic practice can truly place one on the proper path of the cultivation of the bases of spiritual power.

VI. The Power of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power to Sustain Life and Their Great Fruits and Great Merits

VI.1 The Relationship Between the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and the Ability to Remain in the World  
Regarding the relationship between the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and the ability to remain in the world, the scriptures state that by cultivating and extensively cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, and by making them a vehicle, a ground, something that is naturally accomplished, accumulated as habit, and well fashioned, a practitioner can acquire a certain ability to remain in the world. To make them a vehicle means to allow the Four Bases of Spiritual Power to become the conveyance that carries one’s practice; to make them a ground means to allow them to be the foundational ground upon which the mind abides; to be naturally accomplished means to let the Four Bases of Spiritual Power be accomplished spontaneously in accordance with conditions; to accumulate as habit means to repeatedly cultivate and imbue oneself with the Four Bases of Spiritual Power over a long period; to be well fashioned means to skillfully shape the accomplishment of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power in all thoughts and actions. This sequence of practices enables practitioners to abide in the world without being moved by circumstances, and to rely on the bases of spiritual power in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, moving freely forward and back.

VI.2 Great Fruits and Great Merits  
As for the benefits brought by the cultivation of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, the scriptures clearly state that cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power yields great fruits and great merits. As the accomplishment of energetic practice in desire‑samādhi, energy‑samādhi, mind‑samādhi, and investigation‑samādhi, the Four Bases of Spiritual Power not only enable one to experience many kinds of miraculous transformations and reach the exhaustion of all taints, attaining liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, but also, because of their close connection with the noble path, nirvāṇa, supernormal powers, great majesty, and liberation, they become a path of practice with great fruits and great merits.

VI.3 Summary of the Relationship Between the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and Moving Toward Nirvāṇa  
In summary, the Four Bases of Spiritual Power are the fundamental method for accomplishing supernormal powers, majesty, and ultimate liberation; they are the key foundation for attaining the seven stages of liberation, the exhaustion of all taints, and liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and are the proper path commonly relied upon by all accomplished ones in the past, present, and future. By cultivating and extensively practicing the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, one can go from this shore to the other shore, proceed from the state of being with taints to the complete exhaustion of taints, move from bondage by desire to the thorough cutting off of desire, and from the round of birth and death toward nirvāṇa, personally knowing and personally experiencing taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom in this very life, and ultimately abiding in a state of complete purity and perfection.
