<title> The Rule of the Five Powers, Family Status, and Levels of Fulfillment </title>

I. The Rule of Family Status and the Operation of the Five Powers

Within the family structure, if a woman can possess five kinds of power at the same time, she can live in the home safely and without fear, stand her ground in the family without shrinking back, and may even be able to suppress or overcome her own husband. The five kinds of power referred to here are: the power of beauty, the power of property, the power of kinship, the power of children, and the power of sovereignty/authority. When all five powers are present, a woman’s status in the family becomes secure and strong, and is not easily shaken.

However, the way power operates between men and women is not symmetrical. A man needs only the single power of sovereignty to be able to overcome a woman. A man does not need to possess the other powers—beauty, property, kinship, and children—at the same time; as long as he holds sovereignty, he can occupy an overwhelming advantage in the relationship. Once a woman is overcome by this power of sovereignty, she is no longer able to properly safeguard the five powers she originally possessed. In other words, when the power of sovereignty is subordinated to the man and not held in the woman’s own hands, then even if she still has the other powers of beauty, property, kinship, and children, she cannot truly preserve and autonomously exercise these powers, and the defensive and supportive function of the five powers is thereby weakened.

II. The Rule of Power-Fulfillment and the Hierarchy of One’s Final Station

When assessing whether a person’s five kinds of power are complete or fulfilled, different grades or levels can be distinguished; this may be regarded as the rule governing the fulfillment and “final station” of one’s powers. When a person possesses only the power of beauty and lacks the other powers, this state is viewed as “partially unfulfilled,” meaning that mere physical attractiveness is not sufficient to constitute a full and rounded power. If, in addition to beauty, the person also acquires the power of property, thus possessing both beauty and property, this situation is regarded as “partially fulfilled”: it shows that the powers have been increased, yet still have not reached overall completeness.

When a person simultaneously possesses the power of beauty, the power of property, and the power of kinship—that is, in addition to beauty and wealth, also has the backing of a supportive kinship network—this still only reaches the level of being “partially fulfilled,” and cannot yet be considered truly complete. If, on this basis, the person further acquires the power of children—that is, has offspring—so that the four powers of beauty, property, kinship, and children are all present at once, this condition is still classified as “partially fulfilled,” indicating that even with four accumulated powers, one link is still missing.

Only when a person simultaneously possesses all five powers—the power of beauty, the power of property, the power of kinship, the power of children, and the power of sovereignty—can this be regarded as having reached a state of “complete fulfillment.” In such a case, the five kinds of power echo and support one another, enabling the person to attain the most complete stability and accomplishment in both the family and the final station of life. This state of fulfillment is precisely the highest level toward which the aforementioned gradations—from unfulfilled, to partially fulfilled, and finally to complete fulfillment—are directed.
