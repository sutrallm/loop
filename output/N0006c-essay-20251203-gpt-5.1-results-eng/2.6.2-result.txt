I. The Choice of a Practice Environment and the Implementation of the Principles

I.1 Dwelling in a Quiet Place Far from the City and Living Alone in the Forest

In the course of practice, choosing an appropriate environment is an important foundation for putting the principles of practice into effect. Practitioners should, as far as possible, live in a quiet place far from the city, distancing themselves from dust and clamor, reducing interference from external conditions, and giving body and mind sufficient space to settle and turn inward in contemplation. On this basis, if one can further choose to live alone in the forest, it is even more conducive to practicing the essential points of non‑liberation. Living alone in the forest means not only being in a quiet natural environment, but also that the practitioner is far from the clinging to people and from miscellaneous duties, allowing the mind, in solitude, to face its own attachments and afflictions, and thereby to implement, step by step, the essential points that have been learned.

I.2 Practicing the Essentials of Non‑liberation and the Goal of Liberation

When living alone in the forest, the practitioner can concentrate more fully on practicing the various essential points of non‑liberation. Through this kind of deliberate cultivation, and by gradually putting into practice the principles one follows, one can, outside the turbulent world, develop solid concentration and clear awareness. By accumulating and deepening the above cultivation, the practitioner can cross beyond the realm of the death‑mara, transcend the bondage of birth and death, and leave behind all fetters connected with death, fear, and mara‑like states. As practice matures, one reaches the further shore, no longer entangled by saṃsāra and afflictions. When body and mind truly penetrate this state, the heart‑mind can attain liberation, directly realizing freedom and ease in the present moment, thereby fulfilling the goal of crossing from the sea of suffering of birth and death to the further shore.

II. The Mental Attitude and Daily Practice During the Path

II.1 The Relation Between a Quiet Dwelling Place and Inner Settling

Dwelling in a quiet place far from the city is not only for the sake of obtaining a peaceful environment; it is also to create the conditions for the settling of the mind. Once one is far from the noise and temptations of the city, practitioners are less easily pulled by sights, sounds, and material wealth, and the mind more readily gathers in, no longer being constantly stirred by external situations. When the environment becomes quiet, the practitioner can more clearly observe each arising of intention and thought, and thereby examine whether they are truly practicing in accordance with the teachings, and whether they are acting in line with the aforementioned essential points and methods of practice concerning non‑liberation. In this way, external distance from the city and external quiet harmonize with internal awareness and settling, so that the practice environment and the mental attitude of practice mutually bring each other to fulfillment.

II.2 Maintaining Mindfulness and Guarding the Sense Faculties While Going on Almsround

However, practice is not limited to quiet places or forests; in daily conduct, such as when going on almsround, one must likewise face things with the correct mental attitude. When a practitioner goes out to beg for alms, they should maintain mindfulness at all times, not allowing the mind to scatter along with external conditions. The function of mindfulness here is to prevent the practitioner from being moved and defiled by what is seen, heard, or touched, thereby achieving the purpose of guarding the sense faculties. Guarding the faculties means protecting and watching over the six faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, so that when these six faculties come into contact with external objects, they are not governed by afflictions such as greed, anger, and delusion. When, during the almsround, the practitioner can guard the various faculties in this way, then even while in the human world amid crowds and marketplaces, they can still maintain an inner clarity and stability, echoing the spirit of practice when living alone in the forest. In this way, whether dwelling in a place of silence or moving about in human markets, the practitioner can extend the power of practice into every act of walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, together advancing the process of crossing from the realm of the death‑mara to the further shore and ultimately attaining liberation of the heart‑mind.
