<title> Contemplation of the Five Aggregates and the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging, and the Path Leading to Liberation </title>
<article>
I. The State of the Liberated One and the Core of the Teaching

I.1 The Unshakable Mental Qualities of One Who Is Liberated  
A truly liberated person can keep the mind calm and unmoving, no longer drawn by worldly attachment. Such a person has gone beyond clinging to all worldly circumstances and no longer rises and falls, swayed by craving. When he opens his mouth to teach the Dhamma, there is no fear in his heart; faced with listeners or with any environment, he does not shrink back. Even when body and mind encounter various kinds of pain, he still contemplates them with right mindfulness as they really are, overcoming these physical and mental pains with clear awareness and wisdom, not allowing painful feelings to create new bonds.

Such a liberated one has gone beyond the bonds of the senses. Faced with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and all mental objects, he no longer produces craving and attachment toward the five sense-objects; the mind-consciousness no longer turns and moves with external conditions. He does not rejoice over agreeable objects, nor does he hate or grieve over disagreeable ones. He has directly known and seen the five aggregates subject to clinging, and understands that form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are not “I,” not “mine,” and not “my self,” and thus no longer establishes any self-identity among them.

I.2 A Teaching that Takes the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging as Its Core  
The true Dhamma proclaimed by the liberated one takes the five aggregates subject to clinging as its core. Starting from the five aggregates subject to clinging, he further explains the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—and the true nature of their corresponding objects and contacts, so that listeners may understand that the sense faculties and their objects, and the consciousness and feelings arising therefrom, are merely dependently arisen phenomena, not a real self. On this basis, he points out the path of practice leading to Nibbāna, guiding practitioners to proceed step by step toward disenchantment, dispassion, and final liberation by seeing the five aggregates subject to clinging and the six sense bases as they really are.

II. The Root of Suffering and the Oppressive Nature of the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging

II.1 The Noble Truth of Suffering and the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging  
All the suffering experienced by beings is fundamentally constituted by the five aggregates subject to clinging. The essence of suffering is not something apart from them; it appears precisely within the clinging to the aggregate of form, the aggregate of feeling, the aggregate of perception, the aggregate of formations, and the aggregate of consciousness. Once these five physical-and-mental groupings are grasped and clung to, they become the root that oppresses life, as dangerous and terrifying as standing under a guillotine that may fall and behead one at any time. The five aggregates subject to clinging are like five mortal enemies pursuing one’s life, relentlessly chasing and oppressing beings, causing them to suffer again and again in saṃsāra.

Thus, what the Noble Truth of Suffering points to is precisely the five aggregates subject to clinging. The aggregate of form subject to clinging is the clinging to material form; the aggregate of feeling subject to clinging is the clinging to various feelings; the aggregate of perception subject to clinging is the clinging to diverse concepts and recognitions; the aggregate of formations subject to clinging is the clinging to volitions and activities; the aggregate of consciousness subject to clinging is the clinging to discriminatory awareness and consciousness activities. Whenever clinging arises toward these five aggregates subject to clinging, one falls into the domain of suffering.

II.2 The Results of Clinging to and Not Clinging to the Five Aggregates  
When beings cling to the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—there arise various labels and comparative judgments. Using the five aggregates as a basis, they discriminate “self and others,” “superior and inferior,” “high and low”; and thus all kinds of names, comparisons, and views of superiority and inferiority arise in succession, further intensifying afflictions and conflict. If, however, one no longer clings to form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, and no longer establishes ideas of “I” and “mine” within them, then those appellations and comparative cognitions that arise based on the aggregates can no longer be established. In this way, many causes of suffering born of discrimination and comparison can be uprooted.

III. The Worldling’s Misunderstanding of Bodily and Mental Phenomena

III.1 Different Attitudes toward the Physical Body and Mental Phenomena  
Ordinary worldlings can, to some degree, give rise to aversion and a wish to distance themselves from the physical body composed of the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind. They can see that this body grows, ages, is acquired, and is discarded; these changes are very obvious, so they occasionally feel the impermanence of the body and may even wish to be freed from bondage to it.

However, when it comes to mental phenomena such as mind, thought, and consciousness, worldlings find it very difficult to give rise to aversion or a wish to withdraw from them, let alone truly be liberated from them. The reason is that, for a long time, they have clung to notions such as “this is my mind,” “this is me,” and “this is my self,” mistaking the ever-changing thoughts and consciousness for a permanent, real self. This deep attachment to mental phenomena makes it very difficult for worldlings to arouse disenchantment and the motivation for liberation toward them.

III.2 A Comparison of Stability between Body and Mind-Consciousness  
In terms of duration, the physical body can often remain for one year, two years, even a hundred years or longer, and appears relatively stable. Mental phenomena such as mind, thought, and consciousness, however, are changing day and night: arising and ceasing from moment to moment, without even an instant of remaining unchanged. The body is already not truly reliable; how much less so are mind and consciousness, which change even more swiftly. Precisely for this reason, worldlings can occasionally give rise to disenchantment toward the body, yet with regard to mental phenomena that change even faster, they still cling strongly to them as “I,” “mine,” and “self.” This becomes a major obstacle to liberation.

IV. The Structure, Nature, and Danger of the Five Aggregates and the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging

IV.1 The Classification of the Five Aggregates and the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging, and Their Nature as Objects to Be Fully Known  
When body and mind are analyzed, they can be divided into the five aggregates: the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. When clinging arises toward these five aggregates, there are formed the five aggregates subject to clinging: the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness subject to clinging. Thus, in essence, the five aggregates and the five aggregates subject to clinging are the same set of physical-and-mental groupings; what differs is whether there is clinging or not. The very essence of suffering lies in the five aggregates subject to clinging; therefore they are classified as phenomena that ought to be “fully known,” which must be thoroughly understood through contemplation.

In the direct seeing of the five aggregates subject to clinging as they really are, four aspects must be clearly recognized: first, the nature of each aggregate subject to clinging; second, the causes for their arising; third, the state of their cessation; and fourth, the correct path that leads to their cessation. Only when one thoroughly understands the five aggregates subject to clinging from these four aspects—nature, arising, cessation, and the path leading to cessation—has one truly grasped the core teaching related to the Noble Truth of Suffering.

IV.2 The Sevenfold Framework of Knowing and the Differences among the Aggregates  
There is a framework known as the “sevenfold knowing” for contemplating the five aggregates. First, in terms of nature, each aggregate has its own sixfold classification and specific content. Second, in terms of arising, each aggregate arises dependent on particular conditions. Third, in terms of cessation, each aggregate ceases dependent on particular conditions. Fourth, the right path leading to the cessation of each aggregate is fundamentally the Noble Eightfold Path. Fifth, for each aggregate one must understand how beings give rise to delight and attachment toward it—this is the aspect of “function of delight and clinging.” Sixth, one must also discern its “inherent danger,” namely that, being impermanent and suffering, it will eventually deteriorate. Seventh, one must grasp the “means of transcendence,” that is, transcending each aggregate by subduing and cutting off sensual desire and craving toward it.

More concretely, the nature of the aggregate of form is the four great elements and the material forms derived from them; its arising depends on the accumulation of “nutriment,” and its cessation depends on the ending of “nutriment.” The nature of the aggregate of feeling is the six classes of feeling, that is, the various feelings born of eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact; its arising depends on the accumulation of contact, and its cessation depends on the cessation of contact. Similarly, the nature of the aggregate of perception is the six classes of perception, from perception of forms up to perception of dhammas; the nature of the aggregate of formations is the six classes of volition, from volition regarding forms up to volition regarding dhammas. The arising of these two aggregates also depends on the accumulation of contact, and their cessation depends on the cessation of contact. As for the aggregate of consciousness, its nature is the six classes of consciousness, from eye-consciousness up to mind-consciousness; its arising depends on the accumulation of name-and-form, and its cessation depends on the cessation of name-and-form. Only when one, using this sevenfold framework, distinctly grasps each aggregate’s nature, conditions for arising and ceasing, and the method of transcendence, can one’s understanding of the five aggregates be considered complete.

IV.3 The Common Seals and Dangerous Aspects of the Five Aggregates  
Regardless of whether it is form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness, all aggregates share common characteristics: they are all impermanent. Because they are impermanent, they are suffering; because they are suffering, they are non-self. Non-self means that they are not “mine,” not “I,” and not “my essence.” This understanding is not merely an abstract idea; it must be seen directly in practice with right wisdom. Precisely because the five aggregates possess the three marks of impermanence, suffering, and non-self, practitioners ought to cut off desire, craving, and attachment toward the aggregates, no longer regarding them as a reliable or desirable source of happiness.

Furthermore, the five aggregates have other traits that make them objects toward which desire should be abandoned. Form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are impermanent, suffering, and non-self; at the same time they are “not truly one’s own,” not things that really belong to oneself, and they are phenomena that “abide in what is defiled,” easily becoming bases for the arising of defilements. For these reasons, practitioners should completely cut off desire and attachment toward the five aggregates. In addition to being contemplated as impermanent, suffering, empty, and non-self, the five aggregates subject to clinging are also contemplated by virtue-holders and arahants as having the meanings of disease, abscess, dart, pain, “other,” and “subject to destruction,” indicating that the aggregates are like diseases and festering sores, like darts and painful spots that make one ill at ease, are “other,” and are things that will ultimately decay and perish.

V. The Non-self Contemplation of the Five Aggregates and the Path of Eliminating Conceit

V.1 General Principle: The Threefold Non-self Contemplation and Dimensions of Practice  
As a general principle of wisdom contemplation, with regard to any past, future, or present aggregate, whether internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, one should not regard it as “I,” “mine,” or “my self,” but must contemplate it with correct wisdom that sees as it really is. This contemplation is called the “threefold non-self contemplation”: establishing three understandings toward whatever is contemplated—“this is not mine, this is not I, this is not my essence.” This is not a concept established merely through speculation, but must be repeatedly applied in actual experience with right wisdom and direct observation.

The objects of contemplation are the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—while the dimensions of contemplation extend across three aspects: time, space, and quality. In terms of time, it includes past, future, and present; in terms of space, it covers internal and external; in terms of quality, it includes coarse and subtle, inferior and superior, far and near. With respect to each of the five aggregates, one must apply this threefold non-self contemplation across these dimensions, seeing them as they really are. When practitioners repeatedly contemplate every form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness with the reflection, “All of this is not mine, not I, not my essence,” they gradually loosen their deep-seated clinging to the five aggregates.

V.2 Right Contemplation of the Five Aggregates and the Elimination of Conceit  
A well-instructed noble disciple, and indeed all practitioners, ought to contemplate all phenomena with correct wisdom as they really are, especially all forms, feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousness, and ultimately arrive at the conclusion that none of these is “I,” “mine,” or “my essence.” This right contemplation is applicable not only to the five aggregates but also to all experienced phenomena in general. When right contemplation is fully established, the practitioner can attain liberation through non-clinging, no longer establishing an “I” with regard to any phenomenon.

In the practice of eradicating conceit, one must particularly contemplate with right wisdom all situations of the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness in the past, future, and present; internal and external; coarse and subtle; inferior and superior; far and near. For all manifestations of the five aggregates in all these situations, one must draw the same conclusion: “All this is not mine, this is not I, this is not my essence.” Through such knowing and seeing as they really are, the practitioner can, within the conscious body and all external phenomena, eliminate self-conceit, conceit about “what is mine,” and the underlying tendencies to conceit, distancing the mind from “I,” self-conceit, conceit about “what is mine,” and all manifestations of conceit, thereby transcending the grasping of all signs and attaining good liberation.

Within such contemplative practice is also included the corrective view toward the body that remedies wrong views of self. The practitioner, with respect to form, no longer takes form as self, nor imagines that self possesses form; with respect to feeling, no longer takes feeling as self, nor imagines that self possesses feeling; with respect to perception, no longer takes perception as self, nor imagines that self possesses perception; with respect to formations, no longer takes formations as self, nor imagines that self possesses formations; with respect to consciousness, no longer takes consciousness as self, nor imagines that self possesses consciousness. When such contemplation becomes stable, wrong views about “I” naturally dissolve.

VI. Knowledge and Vision of Impermanence, Suffering, Non-self, and the Arising and Ceasing of the Five Aggregates

VI.1 The Universal Principle of Impermanence and Suffering  
In contemplating the five aggregates, one must grasp a fundamental principle: form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are all impermanent. Because they are impermanent, they are suffering; whatever is impermanent and suffering is a phenomenon subject to change and decay; there is not a single phenomenon that remains constant and unchanging. One should never give rise to clinging such as “this is mine,” “this is I,” or “this is my true self” with respect to such phenomena. This principle applies not only to the five aggregates but to all objects of contemplation.

Thus, for any form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness, whether past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near, one should contemplate them as they really are: they are impermanent, suffering, and non-self. It is precisely through such contemplation as it really is that the practitioner’s mind can give rise to disenchantment toward the five aggregates, then further become free from craving and thereby attain liberation. When liberation is realized, “the knowledge of liberation” arises: a clear understanding that the round of life is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further continuation of this life-stream, and no further becoming.

VI.2 The Five Aggregates as Impermanent, Suffering, and Subject to Change  
In more concrete contemplation, one must see that the aggregate of form is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change; the aggregates of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are likewise impermanent, suffering, and subject to change. This contemplation is a fundamental principle of wisdom. Because the five aggregates themselves are phenomena that are subject to change, impermanent, suffering, and non-self, one should regard them as dangerous and unreliable. A noble disciple should also contemplate in line with the understanding that “all five aggregates are suffering,” no longer cherishing the aggregates of the past, no longer delighting in the aggregates of the future, and regarding the aggregates currently being experienced with an attitude that moves toward disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation.

When a well-instructed noble disciple contemplates the five aggregates, he does not cling to the aggregates of the past, does not thirst for the aggregates of the future, and directs the aggregates of the present toward disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation. This attitude is both a knowledge and vision of the true nature of the aggregates, and a practical method for cutting off attachment to them. Whoever does not cling to past aggregates, does not delight in future aggregates, and directs the present aggregates toward disenchantment, freedom from craving, and cessation is walking in accordance with the path to liberation.

VI.3 A Complete Understanding of the Arising and Cessation of the Five Aggregates  
In the cultivation of the perception of impermanence, one must concretely contemplate the process of arising and ceasing of the five aggregates. Regarding form, one must know the nature of form, the arising of form, and the cessation of form; regarding feeling, one must know the nature of feeling, the arising of feeling, and the cessation of feeling; regarding perception, one must know the nature of perception, the arising of perception, and the cessation of perception; regarding formations, one must know the nature of formations, the arising of formations, and the cessation of formations; regarding consciousness, one must know the nature of consciousness, the arising of consciousness, and the cessation of consciousness. In this way, for each aggregate one understands four aspects—its nature, the causes for its arising, the state of its cessation, and the right path leading to its ending—only then can one be said to have a complete understanding of the five aggregates.

In the practice of the establishments of mindfulness (satipaṭṭhāna), this structure is equally important. The practitioner contemplates the causal conditions for the arising of the body, for its cessation, and for the arising-and-ceasing of the body; contemplates the causal conditions for the arising of feelings, for their cessation, and for the arising-and-ceasing of feelings; contemplates the causal conditions for the arising of mind, for its cessation, and for the arising-and-ceasing of mind; contemplates the causal conditions for the arising of dhammas, for their cessation, and for the arising-and-ceasing of dhammas. Through frequent and repeated cultivation of the four establishments of mindfulness, one can cut off desire toward body, feelings, mind, and dhammas, and fully know body, feelings, mind, and dhammas. When one rightly knows form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness and their arising and cessation, one can, based on this knowledge and vision, bring all defilements to an end.

VII. The General Outline and Sequential Practice of Contemplating the Five Aggregates

VII.1 General Outline of Practice and Aspects of Contemplation  
In the core principles of practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, the clear object of practice is the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—with the aim of cutting off desire, craving, and attachment toward the aggregates and their various characteristics. Practitioners should maintain continuous contemplation of the aggregates, focusing on several key aspects: disenchantment with the aggregates, the experiential insight into their impermanence, the penetrative seeing of their nature as suffering, and the direct recognition of their non-self. Practitioners should direct attention in accordance with right method, contemplating the five aggregates subject to clinging as impermanent, suffering, empty, and non-self, and, at a deeper level, regarding them as disease, abscess, dart, pain, “other,” and “subject to destruction,” thereby fundamentally shaking their attachment to the aggregates subject to clinging.

The concrete steps of practice are: first, properly attend to and observe a particular aggregate; then see clearly and truly its impermanent nature. When the perception of impermanence toward that aggregate is clear, a sense of disenchantment naturally arises. As delight and craving are gradually eliminated through such contemplation, one can attain liberation of mind. By dwelling in strong disenchantment toward form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, one can fully know the five aggregates and thereby be liberated from them; if one further dwells in contemplation of their impermanence, one can fully know the five aggregates and be liberated from suffering; by dwelling in contemplation of their non-self, one likewise can fully know the five aggregates and be liberated from suffering.

VII.2 From Disenchantment and Dispassion to Liberation and the Knowledge of Liberation  
When a well-instructed noble disciple contemplates form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness with such right view, he sees the true nature of the aggregates as they really are and gives rise to disenchantment toward them. Because of disenchantment, he abandons craving; through the abandoning of craving he attains liberation. At the moment of liberation, the knowledge of liberation arises; he knows as it really is: “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further becoming,” and he knows that there will no longer be any future round of rebirth.

The sequence of contemplation can be described as follows: first, one contemplates the aggregates and gives rise to disenchantment; next, due to disenchantment, one abandons desire; then, through the abandoning of desire, one attains liberation. Once liberated, the knowledge of liberation naturally arises; one knows for certain that the cycle of rebirth has ended, that pure practice has been established, that everything that ought to be cultivated has been completed, and that there will be no further continuation of life. Likewise, if one rightly contemplates the illusory nature of the five aggregates and gives rise to disenchantment, one can gradually be freed from desire and attain liberation; after liberation, wisdom arises, and finally one no longer undergoes future becoming.

In this process, “rightly directed” (well-oriented) is an important stage. If a practitioner can rightly know any one aggregate subject to clinging in terms of its nature, arising, cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, and further gives rise to disenchantment, dispassion, and the tendency toward its extinction, he is called “rightly directed.” One who has attained this state has correctly entered into this Dhamma and Vinaya. When a practitioner as a whole gives rise to disenchantment toward the five aggregates, gives rise to dispassion toward them, and pursues their cessation, he then has the qualification to enter this Dhamma and Vinaya and truly stands on the path to liberation.

VII.3 The State of Being Rightly Directed and Three Types of Practitioners  
Viewed from the perspective of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to the five aggregates, practitioners can be divided into three types. First, those who teach for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—are called “monks who preach the Dhamma,” or simply “preachers of the Dhamma.” Second, those who actually practice in the direction of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation of the five aggregates are called “monks who follow the Dhamma and abide in accordance with the Dhamma,” or “followers of the Dhamma.” Third, those who, by means of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to the five aggregates, no longer cling to them and attain liberation are called “monks who have attained Nibbāna in this very life,” or “attainers of Nibbāna in this very life.”

The establishment of these three types of practitioners is inseparable from the principle of actual practice in terms of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with respect to the aggregates. The preacher takes this as the content of teaching; the follower of the Dhamma is walking this path; and the attainer of Nibbāna in this very life is the one who has fully completed this path. In all three types of practitioners, correct contemplation and practice regarding the five aggregates stand at the core.

VIII. Core Principles of the Five Aggregates and Liberation

VIII.1 Bondage and Liberation: Clinging, Proliferation, and Delight  
The core principle of liberation states: with respect to the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—if one gives rise to clinging, repeatedly turns them over in thought, or delights in and loves them, then at that very moment one is bound by afflictions. Conversely, if one no longer clings to the aggregates, no longer clings to proliferating thoughts and evaluations about them, and no longer delights in or loves them, then the mind is freed from afflictions.

From another angle, when there is clinging, proliferating thoughts, and delight toward the five aggregates, one is bound by Māra. When one no longer clings to the aggregates, no longer thinks of them in a wrong way, and no longer delights in or craves them, one is freed from Māra’s bonds. Therefore, practitioners ought to cut off desire toward those aggregates that possess the characteristics of impermanence, suffering, non-self, not truly being one’s own, and serving as a support for defilements. This cutting off of desire not only severs the relationship with Māra but also loosens the bonds of one’s own afflictions.

VIII.2 Practical Observation of the Arising and Ceasing of the Five Aggregates and the Growth of Disenchantment  
In the basic practice that directly counters self-view and afflictions, one must dwell in contemplation of arising and ceasing in the five aggregates subject to clinging. Specifically, this means directly observing the arising and ceasing of form, the arising and ceasing of feeling, the arising and ceasing of perception, the arising and ceasing of formations, and the arising and ceasing of consciousness. When the practitioner continues to observe the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates in this way, the true nature of the aggregates becomes clearer and clearer: one sees that they merely come together temporarily due to conditions, and disperse again when those conditions fall apart.

Under such observation, disenchantment naturally arises toward form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. This disenchantment is not hatred or aversion; rather, it is the clear realization that, within the aggregates, there is no real, dependable happiness or self to be found, and thus craving is relinquished. This disenchantment and dispassion are the crucial conditions for liberation from the heap of suffering.

IX. Contemplation of the Five Aggregates, the Six Faculties and Objects, and the Oppression of the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging

IX.1 Contemplating Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-self in the Six Faculties and Six Objects  
Apart from the five aggregates themselves, practitioners must also contemplate the six faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—their corresponding objects, the consciousness, contact, and feelings that arise in dependence on them, in the same way. Through observation and reflection they come to know that eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind; all the corresponding objects; and the consciousness, contact, and feelings that arise from them are all impermanent, suffering, and non-self. When the practitioner deeply understands the impermanent, suffering, and non-self nature of these phenomena, a sense of disenchantment toward them naturally arises. From disenchantment, craving for the six faculties and their objects is abandoned; and from abandoning craving, mental liberation is attained.

After such contemplation, a well-instructed noble disciple naturally becomes disenchanted with the six faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind; disenchanted with eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact; and disenchanted with all pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings that arise in dependence on the six contacts. This disenchantment and withdrawal mean that the practitioner no longer regards the six faculties, their objects, and the feelings as genuine happiness or “self,” thereby moving toward liberation of mind.

IX.2 The Oppression of the Five Aggregates Subject to Clinging and Knowledge as They Really Are  
From another perspective, the five aggregates subject to clinging—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, when clung to—are like five mortal enemies pursuing one’s life, constantly oppressing beings. Because beings do not know the true nature, arising, and cessation of the five aggregates subject to clinging, they repeatedly give rise to craving and clinging within them, and thus the suffering of saṃsāra continues without end. Therefore, one must see the five aggregates subject to clinging as they really are: on the one hand, clearly understanding the specific nature of each aggregate subject to clinging; on the other hand, understanding the causes for the arising of the aggregates subject to clinging, the situation of their cessation, and the correct path that leads to their cessation.

On the basis of such knowledge and vision as they really are, the practitioner can fundamentally sever the root by which the five aggregates subject to clinging oppress him, and instead face the functioning of the aggregates with wisdom and the right path, no longer establishing “I” and “mine” among them.

X. Special Similes and Contemplations that Intensify Disenchantment

X.1 The Five Aggregates as Burning Embers, and as Māra, Disease, Dart, Pain, etc.  
To strengthen the sense of the dangerous nature of the five aggregates, the scriptures use many similes to describe them. Form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness are all said to be like “burning embers”: like hot embers that hide danger, seemingly quiet on the surface but still blazing within, burning whoever touches them. If a noble disciple contemplates the five aggregates as burning embers, he gives rise to disenchantment; from disenchantment, he abandons craving; and ultimately he attains liberation, no longer undergoing further becoming.

At the same time, the five aggregates should be contemplated as Māra, as killers, as death, as disease, abscess, dart, pain, and a mass of suffering. Such contemplation is called “right contemplation,” its purpose being to cause a deep disenchantment toward the aggregates to arise in the practitioner’s heart. When disenchantment matures, it naturally leads to dispassion; and once dispassion is achieved, liberation is realized therein. These similes are not merely for disparaging the aggreg­ates; they are to help practitioners see through their dangerous nature, so that they no longer seek stable happiness or a real self within the aggregates.

X.2 The Need to Cut Off Clinging to Phenomena that Are Impermanent, Suffering, and Non-self  
Because the five aggregates possess the characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and non-self, and because they are phenomena that will change and decay and that “abide in what is defiled,” practitioners ought to completely cut off desire, craving, and attachment toward them. This is not merely an intellectual acknowledgment, but must be carried out in contemplation by actually cutting through the craving in the heart for the aggregates. Any phenomenon that has the characteristics of impermanence, suffering, non-self, not truly being one’s own, and being a basis for defilements is not suitable to serve as a support for “I” and “mine”; to give rise to love and craving toward such phenomena can only increase the causes of suffering.

Therefore, the overall aim of practice is to cut off desire and craving toward the five aggregates and all their characteristics, using various forceful similes and contemplations as they really are to remind oneself that the aggregates are not lovable or delightful things, but objects that must be fully penetrated and relinquished.

XI. The Sequence of Contemplation and the Attainment of No Further Becoming

XI.1 Contemplating the Impermanence of the Five Aggregates and the Arising of Disenchantment  
In contemplation, practitioners must first properly observe the illusory nature and impermanent characteristic of the five aggregates. After observing the impermanent nature of the aggregates, they come, through right contemplation and knowledge as it really is, to give rise to disenchantment toward the aggregates. This disenchantment enables practitioners to gradually move away from craving for the aggregates and ultimately attain dispassion and liberation.

When practitioners long continue to contemplate all aggregates of the past, future, and present; internal and external; coarse and subtle; inferior and superior; far and near, and with correct wisdom clearly see: “This is not what I own; this is not I; this is not my essence,” then the mind no longer clings to the aggregates. From this state of non-clinging, practitioners are liberated from all defilements. At the moment of liberation, they clearly know that the round of life is ended, the holy life has been established, what ought to be done has been done, there will be no further continuation of this life-stream, and no further becoming.

XI.2 The Arising of the Knowledge of Liberation and the End of Saṃsāra  
When practitioners follow the above sequence—from disenchantment, to dispassion, to liberation—then at the moment of liberation there arises the wisdom, “I am liberated.” They realize that the round of rebirth has ceased, that pure practice has been established, that all that had to be cultivated has been completed, and that there will be no further rebirth. This knowledge of liberation and the firm assurance, “Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, there will be no further becoming,” is the natural result of fully completed contemplation of the five aggregates.

XII. Completion of the Contemplation of the Five Aggregates, the Elimination of Conceit, and the Purification of View

XII.1 The Elimination of Self-conceit and the Underlying Tendencies to Conceit  
When a practitioner can, with respect to any form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness—in the past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near—contemplate with right wisdom as it really is and firmly establish the understanding “not mine, not I, not my essence,” then self-conceit, conceit about “what is mine,” and all the underlying tendencies to conceit are gradually eliminated. Such contemplation not only dissolves manifest arrogance but also uproots the subtle conceit hidden deep in the heart, causing the practitioner to distance himself from all attachment to “I” and “mine,” transcend all grasping at appearances, and attain good liberation.

At the same time, the practitioner’s views about himself and all external phenomena become purified, forming what is called “purified view.” This purified view is grounded in the direct observation of the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates subject to clinging as they really are. When the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates subject to clinging are clearly seen, personality view (view of self in relation to the body) no longer stands; in its place is the direct knowledge of impermanence, suffering, non-self, and not-mine.

XII.2 The Phenomena to Be Fully Known and Thorough Understanding of Body, Feeling, Mind, and Dhammas  
The five aggregates subject to clinging are classified as phenomena that must be “fully known,” that is, objects that must be completely understood and penetrated. Only when one has fully known the five aggregates subject to clinging can one say that the Noble Truth of Suffering has been understood as it really is. Coordinated with the practice of the four establishments of mindfulness, the practitioner, by contemplating the arising, cessation, and arising-and-ceasing of body, feelings, mind, and dhammas, repeatedly cultivates and frequently develops the four establishments of mindfulness, cuts off desire toward body, feelings, mind, and dhammas, and fully knows the reality of body, feelings, mind, and dhammas.

When one has a thorough understanding of the nature, arising, cessation, and path leading to the cessation of the five aggregates and the five aggregates subject to clinging, and in practice actually cuts off desire and clinging toward the aggregates, then one truly stands on the path to liberation. Ultimately, one is no longer pursued by the five aggregates subject to clinging as five mortal enemies, no longer stands in a position as dangerous as being under a guillotine, but instead, with a mind free of clinging, abides in Nibbāna realized here and now.

XIII. The State of Awareness of Body, Life, and Feeling

XIII.1 Clear Awareness of Body and Life When Free from Bondage  
In the experience of freedom from bondage, the practitioner’s awareness of body, life, and feelings becomes especially clear. When he feels feelings within the domain of the body, he clearly knows in his heart, “I am experiencing feelings within the domain of the body.” When he feels feelings within the domain of life, he likewise clearly knows, “I am experiencing feelings within the domain of life.” This awareness does not posit a substantial “I”; it merely recognizes the range of feelings being experienced as they really are.

When the body breaks up and perishes, he knows, “Life ends here; all feelings have ceased; there is no more joy or pleasure; it becomes cold, and only a corpse remains.” This knowledge of the breaking up of the body and the ending of life shows that he no longer establishes a real “I” within body and life, but merely sees as they really are the process of bodily decay, cessation of feeling, and life’s end. This awareness is a direct experience of the principles of impermanence, suffering, and non-self as they relate to the five aggregates.

XIV. Summary: Contemplation of the Five Aggregates and the Criteria for the Path Leading to Nibbāna

XIV.1 Using Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-self to Examine All Objects  
When practitioners contemplate form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, as well as eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, and their respective objects, consciousness, contact, and feelings, they should first ascertain that their nature is impermanent. Then they recognize that whatever is impermanent is suffering; whatever is impermanent and suffering is a phenomenon subject to change and decay. On this basis, they understand that they should not give rise to clinging such as “this is mine,” “this is I,” or “this is my true self” toward these objects. This method of examination enables practitioners, in the course of actual practice, constantly to review whether they are still establishing self-views and self-clinging with respect to the five aggregates and the six faculties and their objects.

When this examination is repeatedly carried out and increasingly consolidated in contemplative practice, practitioners can, with regard to the five aggregates and all phenomena, constantly confirm their nature as impermanent, suffering, non-self, and “not mine, not I, not my essence,” so that they no longer establish an “I” among them. In this way, they can truly walk the path of contemplation of the five aggregates that leads to the actual attainment of Nibbāna.

XIV.2 Non-clinging and Abiding in Liberation  
Ultimately, when practitioners clearly understand the nature, arising, cessation, and path leading to the cessation of the five aggregates, and in actual practice have cut off desire, craving, attachment, and self-clinging toward the aggregates, they no longer cling to the five aggregates or to any phenomenon at all. This non-clinging is the fundamental sign of liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and is the actual content of Nibbāna realized in this very life. The five aggregates still function in dependence on conditions, but for the practitioner they are no longer Māra, no longer killers, no longer diseases or darts; they are merely phenomena of impermanence, suffering, and non-self that are clearly seen as they really are. Thus, contemplation of the five aggregates is brought to completion, and the path of liberation is realized in the present moment.
