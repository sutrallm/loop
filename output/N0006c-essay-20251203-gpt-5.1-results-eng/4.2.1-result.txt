I. Attitude Toward the Sacred Dharma and the Destinations of Cause and Effect  

I.1 The Universal Application of the Law of Cause and Effect in Relation to the Sacred Dharma  

In dealing with the sacred Dharma, there is a universally applicable law of cause and effect: regardless of who a person is, whatever their identity, status, or background, the results they will meet in the future depend entirely on the attitude they hold toward the sacred Dharma. This law admits no exceptions based on individual differences, nor does it change with time or circumstance. It looks only at whether, when one encounters the sacred Dharma, one is respectful and accepts it in faith, or instead slanders and belittles it. On this basis, the results one must bear in this life and in future lives are determined.  

I.2 The Correspondence Between Attitude and Result  

If someone gives rise to a mind of slander toward the sacred Dharma, denying, defiling, or despising it in various ways, then he will gradually become a frivolous and foolish person, lacking wisdom and right conduct as he wanders in the world. After death he will fall into the Wailing Hell, where he will long endure extreme suffering and find it very difficult to escape such a miserable state.  

Conversely, if someone harbors a mind of reverence and faith toward the sacred Dharma, and meets all things with a peaceful mind and a patient attitude; if he can honor the sacred Dharma with a respectful heart and give rise to genuine faith in and veneration for it, then when he lays down this body he will be reborn among the gods, in a good destination. He will have the ability to take part in the assemblies of the heavenly beings, to dwell together with them in a pure and blissful realm.  

II. Drawing Near to Good Spiritual Friends, Virtue, and Happiness  

II.1 The Virtue and Happiness That Come from Drawing Near to Good Spiritual Friends  

In cultivation and in the choices of life, whether or not one draws near to good spiritual friends has an extremely decisive influence. One who approaches good spiritual friends can, under their guidance, practice various wholesome deeds and stay far from all kinds of unwholesome actions, step by step tending toward purity in daily life and in mental conduct, thereby avoiding the creation of unwholesome karma.  

Such association not only enables one to obtain genuine happiness and bring stability to both mind and life, but also allows one’s personal virtue to bring honor to one’s relatives, so that the family is illumined by one’s good conduct. Through such guidance and self‑practice, the practitioner can gradually move toward the good path, so that their future destination comes closer to the good realms rather than falling into the evil realms.  

III. The Harm of Wrong Views and Inverted Notions of Good and Evil  

III.1 The Errors in Non‑Buddhist Judgments of Good and Evil  

Some non‑Buddhist teachings are extremely inverted in their judgments of good and evil, even going so far as to claim that killing living beings or taking the possessions of others does not constitute evil, and regarding such acts—whose very nature is invasive and harmful—as harmless or non‑sinful.  

Such judgments of good and evil are completely contrary to true merit and virtue, and are utterly at odds with a correct understanding of the standards for wholesome and unwholesome conduct. They prevent people from establishing proper ethical views and values, leading their behavior astray from the right path and planting extremely bad seeds in terms of cause and effect.  

III.2 The Consequences of Clinging to False Views  

If someone clings strongly to these mistaken views and refuses to abandon them—persisting unchangingly in wrong speech, wrong thoughts, and wrong views, and even defending and propagating them—then in the end he will, because of this, fall into evil destinies.  

The retribution of such evil destinies is the inevitable result produced by long‑term adherence to false views and an unwillingness to correct them. This shows that wrong views not only distort behavior, they also directly lead to bad destinations in the future.  

IV. The Ownership of Actions, Merit, and Future Circumstances  

IV.1 The Personal Ownership and Accompanying Nature of One’s Actions  

With regard to good and evil actions, both have a clear property of “belonging”: every wholesome and unwholesome deed is done by the person himself; there is no action that has nothing to do with oneself. Once these actions are performed, they become truly one’s own possessions; they cannot be shirked, nor can they be shifted onto others.  

Whether good or evil, once an action is completed, it is as if it has firmly attached itself to the doer, becoming a cause and condition that he must face in the future. A person will carry all his actions with him as he goes forward; wherever he is reborn, these actions will not forsake him, but will accompany him all the way.  

IV.2 The Impact of Good and Evil Karma on Future Happiness  

If a person diligently practices wholesome deeds, these wholesome deeds will accumulate true merit and virtue for his future, protecting him as closely as a shadow follows the body, becoming a strength he can rely on as he moves toward what lies ahead.  

This merit is not some fleeting reputation or external achievement, but something that truly accompanies body and mind, able to protect and support him both in this life and in the future, making it easier for him to obtain happiness and good destinies.  

Conversely, if a person commits all sorts of evil deeds, these evil deeds likewise follow him like a shadow and will not depart wherever he goes. Drawn and bound by evil karma, a wrongdoer finds it extremely difficult to obtain genuine happiness. Whether in the mental state and circumstances of the present life, or in the place he goes to in the future, he will be weighed down and afflicted by it.  

IV.3 Essential Points of Practice and the Accumulation of Merit  

Therefore, in concrete practice, one should actively do good and accumulate virtue, without slackness, so that wholesome karma becomes a solid foundation for future happiness. Merit and virtue are not obtained by accident; they must be amassed through continuous wholesome actions.  

Because merit is a reliable support for crossing beyond the suffering of cyclic birth and death, an essential provision for going from this shore to the other shore, one cannot rely only on the limited wholesome karma created in the past, but should constantly accumulate new merit and virtue, increasing wholesome actions day by day. In this way, in the long course of saṃsāra, one will have sufficient reliance and be able to transcend various sufferings and hardships.  

IV.4 The Law Corresponding Good Karma and Five Difficult‑to‑Obtain Circumstances  

In concrete life circumstances, there is also a clear correspondence between wholesome karma and the conditions one encounters. For a person who does not cultivate wholesome karma, there are five circumstances that are extremely difficult to obtain.  

First, it is difficult for such a person to be born into an appropriate family, that is, to obtain good birth and surroundings.  

Second, it is difficult for her, in marriage, to marry into an appropriate family and easily obtain a good husband’s home.  

Third, even if she does marry into an appropriate family, it is not easy to encounter a situation in which the husband has no other wife, and it is even harder to enjoy a pure and exclusive marriage.  

Fourth, even if she marries into an appropriate family and the husband has no other wife, it is still not easy, on this basis, to be able to raise children smoothly.  

Fifth, going further, to be able, while married into an appropriate family, with a husband who has no other wife and with children being raised, still to be able to “prevail over” the husband in living—that is, to hold the dominant position in the marriage or at least not be oppressed by the husband—is especially hard to achieve for one who does not cultivate wholesome karma.  

Conversely, if a person has cultivated wholesome karma in the past or is doing so now, then the five circumstances above are comparatively easy to obtain. Wholesome karma is like a key that opens the doors to these conditions, making it far easier, compared with one who does not cultivate wholesome karma, to be born into an appropriate family, to marry into an appropriate family, to have a husband with no other wife, to raise children smoothly, and even to be able to prevail over the husband in one’s livelihood.  

V. Violating the Law and the Evil Actions that Bring Bad Retribution  

V.1 Specific Words and Deeds that Invite Bad Retribution  

Among the many kinds of behavior, there are several types that very easily bring about bad retribution, which must be clearly recognized and avoided.  

First is speaking false and untrue words—uttering statements that do not accord with fact in order to deceive or mislead others, causing them to be fooled.  

Second is slandering holy ones whose conduct is pure—defiling and vilifying those whose behavior is pure and whose discipline is strict, and denying their virtue.  

Third is being double‑tongued in friendship—appearing outwardly friendly while one’s actions are insincere, treating friends with various forms of false affection or disloyal conduct so that the friendship loses its genuine foundation.  

Fourth is being ungrateful when others bestow kindness on one—harboring no sense of appreciation for favors received, neither grateful nor inclined to repay, and even taking the goodwill of others entirely for granted.  

All these actions violate proper human relationships and moral law, and will naturally attract corresponding bad retributions.  

V.2 Fundamental Evil Qualities and the Retribution of Falling into Hell  

There are some fundamental evil qualities which, if gathered together in one person and left long uncorrected, will lead to extremely heavy retribution.  

If a person lacks faith—having no confidence in the true Dharma and the good path; lacks a sense of shame—never feeling ashamed of his own faults; and lacks moral dread—feeling no disgrace at doing things that ought to be condemned; and on top of that has poor wisdom—unable to distinguish right from wrong and what to accept or reject—then his basic condition is already very dangerous.  

If, on this basis, he further possesses any of the following evil qualities: anger—being quick to rage; resentment—harboring long‑term grudges that he will not let go; jealousy—feeling envious when he sees others excel; stinginess—being extremely miserly with wealth and with merit, unwilling to give; or moral transgression—failing to observe pure conduct and engaging in various violations; corrupt discipline—being lax toward precepts and even breaking them; poor learning—rarely hearing the true Dharma and not seeking to study; laziness—slothful and unenergetic in wholesome deeds; forgetfulness—often losing hold of the wholesome Dharma and right mindfulness that should be remembered and maintained—then the evil qualities he possesses are all the more serious.  

If he then goes further and commits the evil actions that violate the five basic precepts—taking life, killing living beings; taking what is not given, stealing property without permission; sexual misconduct, engaging in improper or unwholesome sexual acts in the realm of desire; false speech, deceiving others by lies; and using grain‑based or flower‑based alcohol and similar intoxicants that bring about drunkenness and heedlessness, causing himself to lose restraint and reason—then he thereby becomes fully possessed of all the foregoing evil qualities and deeds.  

For such a person, when his body breaks and life ends, he will certainly be reborn in a place of loss, an evil destination, a state of great downfall, in hell. “Place of loss” refers to a place from which all good destinies have departed; “evil destination” is a realm filled with distress; “great downfall” means a fall to an extremely deep place, from which it is hard to free oneself; “hell” is a place where one endures extremely intense suffering. Together, these four terms indicate the misery and dreadfulness of his future state.  

V.3 The Prevalence of Evil Actions in the World  

Looking at the actual situation in the world, evil actions are quite widespread; they are by no means the problem of only a few people. Summarized by category, they can be seen as three major types.  

The first type is economic fraud—for example, using various improper means when receiving land or engaging in trade; using false scales so that the weight indicated is untrue; cheating buyers with counterfeit goods; using false measures so that the trading partner suffers loss; and even resorting to bribery in order to obtain illicit gains. All these are deviations from the path of honesty in economic dealings.  

The second type is deceit in human relationships, including hypocritical attitudes, fraudulent behavior, deliberate concealment, and using agents, intermediaries, or hired work to carry out schemes of deception and manipulation so that others fall into traps.  

The third type is violent aggression—such as cutting off others’ limbs, killing, binding and restricting others’ freedom, setting ambushes to attack, plundering, and engaging in robbery. All these are evil actions that directly violate and harm others’ bodies, minds, and property through force.  

As for the distribution of these evil actions, those who stay far away from them are very few; people who truly do not at all become involved in these wrong behaviors are rare. Those who have not yet distanced themselves from such actions and are still frequently revolving within them are the majority. This disparity in numbers reveals the prevalence and severity of evil conduct in the world, and reminds people that they must all the more guard and restrain themselves.  

VI. The Law Governing Rebirth in Heavenly Realms and Good Destinies  

VI.1 The Law for Women with Certain Qualities to Be Reborn in Heaven  

Regarding the destinies of women, there is also a clearly stated law concerning rebirth in heaven. If a woman possesses a specific set of five qualities, then when her body breaks and life ends she will be reborn in the good destinies and heavenly realms.  

Although these five qualities are not here enumerated one by one, the main point is that as long as she genuinely possesses these five qualities, then by virtue of the wholesome karmic power formed from them she will, in the next life, obtain the fruit of rising to the heavenly realms and dwelling in a pure and blissful state.  

VI.2 The Universal Operation of This Law Across Different Combinations of Qualities  

In its application, this law of rebirth in heaven is not limited only to a single, complete set of qualities; rather, it applies broadly to all the combinations of qualities that have been listed. Whether it is a combination of the common qualities together with any one of the individual qualities, or a state of completely possessing all the related qualities that constitute the five‑precept set, as long as it accords with those qualities and combinations previously specified, this law operates with equal effect.  

In other words, whether it is a partial set of qualities combined with the common qualities, or the full and complete possession of all five qualities, both are sufficient to enable the possessor, when body breaks and life ends, to be reborn in the good destinies and heavenly realms. This shows the consistency and universality of this law across different combinations of qualities.
