I. Fundamental Principles of Mindful Guarding of the Faculties

I.1 The Core Meaning of Mindful Guarding of the Faculties  
At all times and in all places, a practitioner should guard the three kinds of actions of body, speech, and mind so that they are not heedless, improper, or scattered. Bodily actions must not be carelessly performed; speech must not be indulged at will; thoughts must not be allowed to run wild. Instead, the three karmas should operate in a clear and appropriate state.  

To achieve this, the mind must be made to abide in right mindfulness, constantly maintaining awareness and being clearly cognizant of the present body, mind, and circumstances. When facing external conditions, one must also be able to restrain the faculties, not being led around by the various external sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects. That is to say, although the six faculties make contact with the six kinds of objects, the mind is not dragged along; all the sense doors are protected and regulated. This is the core meaning of mindful guarding of the faculties.

I.2 The Situations in Which to Practice Guarding the Faculties  
Mindful guarding of the faculties is not an abstract idea; it must be put into practice in concrete situations. At dawn, when putting on robes and taking up the alms bowl—when the practitioner is about to set out to face the external world—that is precisely the moment to arouse right mindfulness, to guard the faculties and prevent the mind from first becoming scattered.  

When entering villages and streets, going from house to house on alms round, one encounters all sorts of environments and people. In such circumstances one must pay special attention to the reactions of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, not becoming heedless or following along with attachment and defilement. Whenever one faces various external conditions—people, things, events, speech, sounds and sights, or any agreeable or disagreeable object—this is the real arena for guarding the faculties. In other words, whenever the faculties are in contact with their objects, that is precisely the time when one should arouse mindfulness and apply guarding.

I.3 Concrete Requirements for Daily Practice  
In daily cultivation, a practitioner should learn and actually practice mindful guarding of the faculties, making such guarding into a habit. One should continually guard the three karmas of body, speech, and mind, keeping them away from evil conduct and heedlessness. One should also keep the mind established in right mindfulness and, by right mindfulness, control the six faculties so that they are not scattered by external objects.  

When going on alms round and walking for food, one should conduct oneself in accordance with the Dharma, observing the rules and proper times for alms gathering, not violating the established discipline and appropriate occasions. Through such daily practice, mindful guarding of the faculties will gradually become stable.

II. The Faults and Consequences of Failing to Guard

II.1 The Immediate Dangers of Not Guarding  
If, when facing external objects, one loses this guarding—especially when seeing scantily dressed or lightly clad women—and if lust arises in the heart, then the mind will be disturbed by this lust. This disturbance is not just a momentary fluctuation; it can lead to extremely serious consequences.  

Because the mind is bound by lust, the practitioner may eventually abandon the training in the precepts or engage in various sinful and defiled actions. Such situations are regarded as “incurring death” or “incurring suffering unto death,” which are considered extremely grave faults.

II.2 The Meaning of Failure to Guard in the Discipline  
In the precepts established by the Noble Ones, if a practitioner, due to failure to guard the faculties, abandons the training rules, gives up the monastic life, and returns to lay life, this is called “death” in the Vinaya, that is, what is termed “death according to the holy discipline.”  

Furthermore, if through association with others one falls into sinful, defiled, and impure conduct, so that one’s mind and actions are stained by guilt and defilement, this is regarded as “suffering unto death,” a form of extremely heavy suffering and downfall. Likewise, if one clearly knows that something is a transgression but still deliberately commits it, this intentional wrongdoing is also regarded as “suffering unto death.”  

From this it is clear that once guarding of the faculties is lost, not only is the mind disturbed, but one also bears consequences in the discipline comparable to death.

III. Right Understanding of the Six Bases and Liberation

III.1 The Bondage Brought by Not Knowing  
If one does not truly understand the various transformations and characteristics of the six internal bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—and of the six corresponding external bases—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects—especially if one does not truly understand their three modes of transformation, then one cannot gain liberation from the whole world.  

Such non-understanding causes the practitioner to remain bound and tied to the world, unable to transcend it, and unable to live with a mind that does not cling. In other words, as long as ignorance still covers the inner and outer six bases, one cannot leave behind all worldly bondage, let alone speak of a life without grasping.

III.2 How Right Understanding Leads to Departure from the World  
Conversely, if one can truly recognize and experience the three modes of transformation of the six internal and six external bases, knowing them as they really are, then one can thereby depart from the entire world. This kind of true knowledge brings disengagement and release, enabling the practitioner to free oneself from attachment and entanglement with worldly things and to live with a mind free from clinging.  

When the nature and changes of the six bases are no longer wrongly taken, the right understanding thus established becomes the foundation of liberation, making departure from the world possible and freedom realizable.

IV. Direct Observation and the Cultivation of Disenchantment

IV.1 Contemplation That Gives Rise to Disenchantment Toward the Six Bases  
In actual observation, a practitioner should give rise to a sense of revulsion and disenchantment toward the eye, visible forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and the various feelings that arise conditioned by eye-contact. That is, not only toward the eye itself and the forms it sees, but also toward the eye-consciousness and eye-contact produced by the meeting of eye and forms, and the feeling that arises due to eye-contact—one should observe all these as they truly are and develop disenchantment toward them.  

The same method should likewise be applied to ear, sounds, ear-consciousness, ear-contact, and feeling; to nose, smells, nose-consciousness, nose-contact, and feeling; to tongue, tastes, tongue-consciousness, tongue-contact, and feeling; to body, tangibles, body-consciousness, body-contact, and feeling; and to mind, mental objects, mind-consciousness, mind-contact, and feeling. Toward ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, and their corresponding objects, contacts, and feelings, one should arouse the same sense of revulsion as is applied to the eye.

IV.2 Awareness of a Defiled Mind and an Undefiled Mind  
When, through the eye seeing forms, the ear hearing sounds, the nose smelling odors, the tongue tasting flavors, the body contacting tangibles, and the mind cognizing mental objects, one perceives the external world, the practitioner should, in that very moment, be aware of one’s inner mental state.  

If the mind becomes attached and defiled by the external objects, that is a defiled mind, and one should clearly know: “My mind is defiled by these objects.” If, when contacting external objects, the mind does not become attached, that is an undefiled mind, and one should clearly know: “My mind is undefiled by these objects.” In this way, whether the mind has already been defiled or remains pure, the practitioner knows one’s own state as it really is, making this very knowing itself part of the practice.

IV.3 Observing the Impermanence, Suffering, and Decay of the Six Faculties  
In further observation, a practitioner should repeatedly examine and recognize that the six faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—are impermanent. From the recognition of impermanence, one proceeds to recognize that all these are suffering, and finally recognizes that they are of a nature to deteriorate and break up.  

That is, the six faculties are not only impermanent; they are characterized by suffering and will ultimately decay and disintegrate, incapable of lasting. Therefore, one should not cling to these faculties and their functions as “self,” should not regard them as “mine,” nor take them as “what I am.” Through such contemplation, the wrong views regarding the six faculties gradually loosen.

IV.4 Seeing Cessation in the Objects Observed and Knowing That Cessation  
In the process of seeing things as they are, a practitioner should directly see the phenomenon of cessation within the objects observed—clearly seeing the fading, stopping, and ceasing of these phenomena. At the same time, one must also inwardly truly know and confirm this fact of cessation; that is, in regard to the objects observed, one both sees their cessation and knows their cessation.  

On the basis of these two aspects—“seeing cessation” and “knowing cessation”—the practitioner develops correct understanding in the heart. Only then does one’s understanding of phenomena become accurate, and one no longer misapprehends their nature.

IV.5 The Principle of Non-Reflection (Non-Deliberation)  
When facing all the phenomena described above, a practitioner should adopt an attitude of “non-reflection.” One does not engage in mental proliferation about these phenomena themselves, nor does one reflect upon and pursue their existence. One does not rely on these phenomena as a basis for various kinds of speculation, nor does one regard them as “what I possess.”  

In other words, regarding all objects of cognition, one does not deliberate on the thing itself, does not deliberate on its existence, does not take it as a support for further deliberation, and does not incorporate it into the domain of “what I own.” In this way one can stay far from grasping.

V. Concrete Methods for Guarding the Six Contact-Bases and Sense Doors

V.1 Guarding When Facing Agreeable Objects  
When seeing agreeable and lovable forms, a practitioner should protect the mind and not allow greed and defilement to arise from them. When hearing pleasing and delightful sounds, one should not let the mind be confused and drawn along by them. When smelling delightful fragrances, one should not arouse desire and let the mind cling to them.  

When tasting delicious flavors, the mind should not become attached and greedy for tastes. When experiencing pleasant and comfortable bodily sensations, one should not become intoxicated with this pleasure and lose mindfulness. Facing all agreeable objects, the mind should clearly recognize: “This is not something I love.” One does not permit oneself to regard it as beloved and grasped, thereby preventing the mind from becoming polluted.

V.2 Guarding When Facing Disagreeable Objects  
When seeing disagreeable forms, the mind likewise should clearly recognize: “This is not something I love,” and should not allow itself to be defiled merely because it dislikes them. When hearing unpleasant or unlovely sounds, one should carefully guard oneself so that no hatred is harbored in the mind.  

When smelling unpleasant or repulsive odors, one should guard against the arising of anger, not allowing it to seize the opportunity to enter. When tasting unpalatable or disagreeable flavors, one should not dwell in anger within that experience or let the mind linger long in discontent. When encountering painful or uncomfortable bodily sensations, the mind should not be shaken by them.  

Toward both pleasant and painful contacts, the mind should remain neutral—neither giving rise to fondness and intoxication nor to anger and rejection—thus maintaining balance between these two extremes.

V.3 The Attainment-Goal of the Complete Fading of the Six Faculties’ Desires  
On a deeper level of realization, the goal is to bring to an end the desire-thoughts associated with the six faculties. When the eye faculty has ended, it means one has become free from desire for notions of visible forms, no longer giving rise to craving and attachment for them. When the ear faculty has ended, it means one is free from desire for notions of sounds and no longer thinks about lovable sounds.  

When the nose faculty has ended, one is free from desire for notions of smells, no longer craving various fragrances. When the tongue faculty has ended, one is free from desire for notions of tastes and no longer delights in taste-objects. When the body faculty has ended, this signifies being free from desire for notions of tangibles, no longer generating craving for pleasant tactile sensations.  

When the mind faculty has ended, one is free from desire for notions of mental objects and no longer craves the various mental contents and objects of thought. All these “endings” point to the cessation of desire-thoughts regarding the corresponding objects, so that the six faculties are no longer driven by desire.

V.4 Principles and Methods for Guarding the Sense Doors  
When facing external objects, a practitioner should not cling to grasping the overall appearance of the object, nor become attached to the investigation of its particular features; one must not let the mind repeatedly climb onto general and specific signs. At the same time, one must actively protect the sense doors, not allowing greed, sorrow, and various unwholesome states any opportunity to invade.  

Specifically: when the eye sees forms, one does not cling to the appearance of forms; through non-clinging to signs, one guards the eye faculty. When the ear hears sounds, one does not cling to the appearance of sounds, thereby guarding the ear faculty. When the nose smells odors, one does not cling to the appearance of odors, thus guarding the nose faculty. When the tongue tastes flavors, one does not cling to the appearance of flavors, thereby guarding the tongue faculty.  

When the body touches tangibles, one does not cling to the appearance of tangibles, thus guarding the body faculty. When the mind knows mental objects, one does not cling to the appearance of mental objects; by not clinging to signs, one guards the mind faculty. In this way, the six faculties are well protected in all encounters with objects.

V.5 The State of Guarded Sense Doors and Mental Liberation  
When the eye sees forms and the sense doors are well guarded, the mind does not lean toward lovable forms nor reject unlovable forms; that is, it does not incline toward what is liked nor turn away from what is disliked. At that time, right mindfulness is present and the mind is clear; it can remain steady amid many thoughts, not losing its guard due to the torrent of distracting ideas.  

One also knows, as it really is, the states of liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, clearly understanding the present state of release. When such guarding is accomplished, all the evil and unwholesome states that had arisen in the mind vanish completely without remainder.  

The same principle applies equally when the ear hears sounds, the nose smells odors, the tongue tastes flavors, the body touches tangibles, and the mind cognizes mental objects. Whenever the six faculties contact their objects, the mind does not sway with personal likes and dislikes and does not easily rise and fall with love and hatred. In this process, right mindfulness becomes firm, and one can maintain thorough and clear awareness over all thoughts. The knowledge and vision of liberation also become distinct and no longer obscure; thus all kinds of evil states are utterly eradicated.

V.6 Using Wisdom to Observe Greed, Hatred, and Delusion in the Six Faculties  
When the eye sees forms, a practitioner should know as it really is whether there is greed, hatred, and delusion within one’s mind. When the ear hears sounds, one should likewise examine whether greed, hatred, and delusion arise in the mind. When the nose smells odors, one should observe whether, at the very moment of smelling, the heart contains these three poisons.  

When the tongue tastes flavors, one should similarly know, as it really is, whether greed, hatred, and delusion are present in the mind. When the body experiences tangible contacts, one should be aware whether, at that moment of contact, there arises craving, aversion, or delusion. When the mind cognizes various mental objects, one should likewise recognize, as it is, whether the mind contains greed, hatred, and delusion.  

If greed, hatred, and delusion are indeed present, then one clearly understands: “There is greed, hatred, and delusion in me.” If, at that time, there are no greed, hatred, and delusion, one also clearly understands: “There is no greed, hatred, and delusion in me.” Through such observation, the wholesome and unwholesome states in the mind no longer remain hidden.

VI. The Arising and Ceasing of the Faculties, and Disenchantment, Dispassion, and Cessation

VI.1 Observing the Arising and Ceasing of the Six Faculties and Giving Rise to Disenchantment  
Regarding the eye faculty, ear faculty, nose faculty, tongue faculty, body faculty, and mind faculty, a practitioner should carefully observe their arising and passing away, seeing how emotional movements and the activities of the sense doors arise and cease from moment to moment.  

When one persistently observes this arising-and-ceasing of the six faculties, the mind naturally develops a sense of revulsion toward the faculties themselves. This disenchantment is not self-hatred; rather, it is a weariness and unwillingness to keep revolving with the ever-arising, ever-ceasing faculties that repeatedly generate afflictions and bondage.

VI.2 Practicing Disenchantment, Dispassion, and Cessation Toward the Six Consciousnesses  
In the core principles of practice, one must apply disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation to all the cognitive functions of the senses—that is, to the eye’s cognition, the ear’s cognition, the nose’s cognition, the tongue’s cognition, the body’s cognition, and the mind’s cognition.  

The method is: first, give rise to disenchantment toward sensory cognition itself, clearly seeing how these cognitions are constantly arising and ceasing and giving rise to various forms of grasping. As disenchantment deepens, one advances to dispassion toward sensory cognition, so that the mind withdraws from desire and craving for cognition itself.  

Finally, one brings about the cessation of sensory cognition in the sense that all grasping and craving toward these cognitions completely stop. This core principle is not limited to any single faculty or consciousness; it is universally applicable to all six cognitive functions. By practicing in this way toward eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness, one gradually accomplishes non-grasping toward all cognition and ultimately attains liberation free of clinging.

VII. Guarding the Sense Doors and Happiness in This Present Life

VII.1 The Role of Guarding the Sense Doors in Present Well-Being and Final Liberation  
In the practices that lead to happiness in this life and to final liberation, there are three important principles, one of which is guarding the sense doors. When the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind correspond to forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental objects, a practitioner should not cling to the general appearance nor to the particular features of objects, so that the mind is not deluded by overall and specific signs.  

By guarding the sense doors in this way, one can prevent unwholesome states such as greed and sorrow from arising at the very moment of contact. To achieve this, one must continuously guard, restrain, regulate, and settle the six faculties, so that when they encounter objects they neither become heedless nor overactive, but come to an appropriate rest and peaceful enjoyment. When guarding, restraining, regulating, and settling are firmly carried out, complete protection of the sense doors is achieved.

VII.2 Mental Activity and Not Being Turned by Conditions  
In the functioning of the mind, if one wishes to prevent it from being turned by external conditions, one must avoid generating craving when facing agreeable objects. No matter how delightful the objects encountered may be, one does not allow the mind to develop attachment. At the same time, when facing disagreeable objects, one does not give rise to rejection or aversion, nor allow the mind to be controlled by feelings of dislike and refusal.  

When the six faculties contact the six objects, if the mind can remain unmoved before any of them, not rising and falling with the changes of circumstances, then the “power dynamic” in relation to the objects reverses to the practitioner’s advantage.

VII.3 The Difference Between Conquering Objects and Being Conquered by Them  
If a practitioner can overcome the six objects and not be bound by them, this is to be on the side of “conquering the objects.” In such a case, Māra the Evil One has no opportunity to invade via the six faculties, because although the six faculties contact the six objects, they do not become entryways through which Māra can disturb the mind.  

Since one is no longer bound by phenomena, one can transcend the bondage of being reborn in defiled realms and will not be drawn into defiled states to be born and suffer. Conversely, if a practitioner is defeated by the six objects and cannot rise above their bondage, one is on the side of “being conquered by the objects.”  

In that situation, Māra gains opportunities to invade through the six faculties, entering the mind through these doors. Being unable to transcend the nature of defilement, at rebirth one gravitates toward defiled realms and ultimately undergoes the fruition of suffering, falling into the cycle of rebirth and distress.

VIII. Sense-Restraint and the Fulfillment of the Three Wholesome Karmas

VIII.1 The Relationship Between Sense-Restraint and the Three Wholesome Karmas  
In the progressive structure of practice, sense-restraint (discipline of the faculties) holds an important place. If one practices sense-restraint and repeatedly familiarizes oneself with it so that it becomes a habit and a natural mode of conduct, then the three wholesome karmas become complete.  

That is, through careful guarding and regulation of the faculties, the wholesome karmas of body, speech, and mind can be fully established, and the foundation of practice will thereby be stabilized.

VIII.2 The Practical Content of Sense-Restraint  
In practicing sense-restraint, when the six faculties contact external objects, one should keep the mind steady, not moved by circumstances. When facing agreeable objects, one does not give rise to craving or excessive joy, not allowing desire to slip in. At such times, body and mind remain settled, and inwardly one attains a subtle liberation, no longer being drawn by agreeable objects.  

When facing disagreeable objects, the mind likewise should not be shaken, not becoming troubled or resentful because things are not to one’s liking. Even when encountering unpleasant situations, body and mind can still remain at rest, and inwardly one maintains the same state of subtle liberation.  

Being able to remain steady and liberated amid both agreeable and disagreeable circumstances is the true practice of sense-restraint and a crucial key to fulfilling the three wholesome karmas.
