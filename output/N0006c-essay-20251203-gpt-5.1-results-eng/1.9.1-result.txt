<title> Heedfulness and Diligent Effort: A Compendium of the Core Principles of the Path to Liberation </title>
<article>
I. From Right Values to a Reliance in Life

In judging the values of life, what is truly lovable is not external people and things, but one’s own cultivation; true wealth does not lie in the amount of possessions, but in storing up wisdom as one would store grain; true light is the inner light of wisdom; and what most nourishes life is the Dharma-rain that moistens one’s own body and mind and benefits all beings. Only when a person clearly recognizes these truly precious things can it be said that they have established a correct understanding of value.

In actual practice, this scale of values is closely linked with heedlessness. Heedfulness is regarded as the supreme wealth protected by the wise; thus one should not indulge in heedlessness, nor keep company with the pleasures of sensual craving, but should instead take meditative contemplation as one’s mode of conduct, relying on meditative practice to attain the highest peace and happiness. If one can do this, one will, by means of heedfulness, guard all wholesome qualities and genuine benefit.

In the face of life’s impermanence and old age, the foundations of security are also clearly pointed out. Moral discipline (precepts) is the basic support for confronting old age and for a stable life; it enables one to remain well-settled even in one’s later years. Faith is a firm foundation and a place of abiding, so that the mind is not overturned; wisdom is regarded as a person’s most precious treasure; and the merits one has accumulated are a kind of wealth no thief can ever steal. From the standpoint of the supreme principles of the world, faith is called the most excellent wealth in life; practicing wholesome Dharma brings security and happiness; and a life based on wisdom is called the highest way of living. At the same time, wisdom is the light of the world, mindfulness is the awakening of the world, and the growth of clear discernment is the most excellent standard among all kinds of attainment.

As to the perfection of virtue, anyone who possesses wisdom, fewness of desires, diligent effort, and skill in teaching will become someone whom those who are not foolish, not defiled, and not scattered in mind all commonly delight in and praise; their virtues appear like precious jewels, radiating pure brilliance. The principle of practicing fewness of desires is to keep one’s cravings sparse, to always be content with what one obtains, and to be tirelessly diligent in both life and practice.

In dealing with others and the external world, the wise also have clear standards of attitude. Based on a clear understanding of one’s own benefit, a wise person should be able to discern and correctly respond in attitude and behavior to four kinds of beings that must never be underestimated: a young kṣatriya (noble warrior) with potential, any snake whatsoever, fire in whatever state it appears, and a bhikkhu whose precepts are pure. If one treats these four lightly and without fear, one will surely bring about adverse consequences; therefore one must approach them with caution and respect.

In the face of the reality of life’s impermanence and the pressure of birth and death, there is also one clear and only way of response. When the oppression of old age and death draws near, the one and only thing to do is to engage in actions that accord with the Dharma—that is, right conduct, wholesome karma, and meritorious deeds. Apart from this, there is nothing else that can truly be done. In concrete practice, one should let body, speech, and mind all act in accordance with the true Dharma, so that all one’s actions fall within right conduct.

II. The Practical Outline of Heedfulness and Diligent Effort

In order to attain liberation, practice must have a clear practical outline. The key to diligent effort lies in cutting off the flood of defilements, and using energy to extinguish sensual craving. In one’s way of life and mental activity, one should withdraw from desire and enter into meditative absorption; whatever wholesome action ought to be done should be done at once with vigor, while at the same time relinquishing all attachment to sensual craving, no longer hankering after any mode of existence, and, on that basis, walking the ascetic path of a renunciant.

In contrast to this are warnings about the faults of laziness. If one who has gone forth into homelessness gives rise to slackness, many defilements will be able to increase; bad conduct will inevitably produce painful results; the precepts one observes will thereby be polluted, and one will come to doubt whether the holy life bears fruit at all. This state not only obstructs purity in this very life, but also shakes one’s confidence in the path of practice.

The core principle of liberation requires that a practitioner be complete in both moral discipline and wisdom: fully maintaining the precepts, while in wisdom making the mind well disposed to stillness. At the same time one must be unyieldingly diligent, assiduous in cultivation and in taming one’s own mind, far removed from all sensual thoughts in order to transcend various fetters, relinquishing all clinging and going forth with right mindfulness. From beginning to end one must not be heedless, not fall under the domain of the Lord of Death, and one must diligently cultivate the factors of awakening, thoroughly restraining and guarding all the sense faculties.

In one’s attitude to practice, the wise person is likened to a strong charioteer and should exert themselves with such a courageous heart. If one becomes lazy in practice, it is like a charioteer leaving the smooth main road and driving onto a rough, uneven track, eventually leading to failure and ruin like a broken axle. If one does not move forward in accordance with the true Dharma, but instead follows a false Dharma, the lazy person will in the end fall into the jaws of Māra’s obstruction and will not escape danger.

With respect to one’s attitude toward life, abiding in a mind free of demands is seen as an important principle. When a practitioner lives on alms, they should maintain a mind of non-expectation and not seek satisfaction with grasping; at the same time, they should clearly understand the fact of the world’s impermanence, and thereby bring about the cessation of suffering and distress. In the direction of practice, one must also know how to accumulate in a positive way—especially to accumulate all kinds of wholesome virtues and merits that bring happiness—so that one’s life moves toward security and purity.

III. Motivation for Practice and the Central Roles of Faith and Wisdom

A practitioner’s motivation arises from the establishment of right faith. When someone, upon seeing the Fully Awakened One, gives rise to right faith in him, and then hears the Buddha expound the teachings on aggregates, sense bases, and elements, they, through hearing the Dharma, arouse the intention to leave the household life, going forth onto the path of renunciation. Thereafter, in study and training, they must keep a heedful attitude, thoroughly completing all that is to be learned until they attain complete mastery.

Among the various kinds of worldly resources, faith is regarded as an excellent kind of wealth and a reliance for crossing hazardous currents; truthful speech and conduct possess the finest flavor and can bring the practitioner a good reputation; wisdom can guide the highest way of living and lead one toward purity; and diligent effort can help a practitioner transcend all suffering and obtain true wealth. In harmony with this, heedfulness is considered the key principle for crossing the great ocean and gaining wisdom; gentleness and patience are seen as qualities possessed by the victors in the world; renunciation enables one to be free of worry and sorrow in the journey from this world to the next; delight in giving enables one to make friends who do not fall apart, establishing stable relationships between self and others.

Summarizing these practical elements further, the inner qualities of mind include faith, truthfulness, gentleness, patience, renunciation, and heedfulness. The outer sphere of practice should be manifested in performing all kinds of wholesome deeds, unremitting effort, delight in giving, realistically taking on responsibility, and skillful discernment and observation. These principles have universally applicable meaning both in worldly life and in the path beyond the world: faith, truthfulness, and wisdom run through worldly happiness and liberating practice, corresponding respectively to the attainments of wealth, good reputation, and purity; diligent effort, heedfulness, and renunciation together govern a life that transcends suffering and is free from worry, concretely expressed in crossing rapids and the great ocean, and in surpassing the sorrows of birth and death.

IV. The Causal Contrast Between Diligent Effort and Laziness

In the contrast between diligent effort and laziness, the principles are quite clear. Those who do not work hard cannot accomplish any goal; only by persevering in diligent effort can one attain genuine accomplishment. For goals not yet attained and states not yet reached, one should strive to bring them about; if one lacks diligence and sinks into heedlessness, one cannot complete what ought to be done and cannot reach a state of happiness.

In actual practice, one’s attitude must be one of tireless effort and unwavering diligence, applying it within the well-taught Dharma, within the precepts one has undertaken, and throughout the entire path of practice. The immediate result in this life is that one can make one’s accomplishments shine forth and reach the states that ought to be reached; the ultimate result is arriving at a place of happiness and obtaining final realization. Conversely, the lazy cannot complete what ought to be done; they miss out on happiness and achievement, whereas diligent effort is the necessary condition for reaching one’s aims, bringing happiness and excellent results. For all goals not yet attained, all states not yet reached, and all ideals not yet realized, one should bring them to completion through diligent effort.

In people’s pursuit of benefit, diligence is regarded as a fundamental principle. If one wishes to gain any benefit, one must make unremitting effort; the very attainment of such benefit naturally brings brightness and distinction. In the sphere of cultivating virtues, having confidence in the Dharma and the discipline, maintaining pure precepts, being learned and widely heard, delighting in doing good, and being endowed with wisdom are regarded as five key qualities of practice.

As for results, the diligent abides in happiness, stays far from all unwholesome states, and accomplishes vast benefit; the lazy abides in suffering, is covered over by unwholesome states, and causes the great benefits that could have been achieved to gradually decline. Therefore, practitioners should bring to bear a courage and diligence such that, even if the body grows emaciated and the flesh and blood dry up, they still do not give up, but strive to reach the states not yet reached. At the same time, they should understand that the monastic life of practice is not in vain, but is indeed an undertaking that yields results and reward. In overall training, one must practice with a heedful attitude, constantly contemplating one’s own benefit, the benefit of others, and the benefit of both self and others, and act with a heedful mind.

V. Qualities of Mind, Ascetic Practices, and Countering Ignorance

As for the attainment of the fruit of stream-entry, the key lies in realizing the noble Dharma through wisdom. A practitioner must be skilled at reflecting on dependent origination and, through wisdom, correctly see and know the noble Dharma; only then will their view be free from partiality and deviation. On the level of actual practice, if laziness arises, even what was originally pure will be polluted, leading to downfall; therefore diligent effort is regarded as the fundamental safeguard for maintaining a pure condition of life. Methods of practice include staying far from laziness and sloth, focusing on meditation and contemplation, often dwelling and cultivating together with virtuous people, and sustaining unremitting diligence.

The qualities of mind can be divided into negative and positive types. Negative qualities include lack of faith, that is, deficiency in trust and confidence; lack of shame, that is, an inner absence of a sense of moral shame; lack of remorse, that is, absence of regret with regard to others; little learning, that is, seldom hearing the true Dharma; laziness, that is, being indolent and not diligent; wrong mindfulness, that is, holding erroneous thoughts; and bad wisdom, that is, possessing wrong understanding and views. In contrast, the positive qualities include firm faith and confidence, an inner sense of shame, a sense of remorse toward others, being well-versed in the Dharma through much hearing, energetic and industrious diligence, correct mindfulness and recollection, and right wisdom and view.

In the cultivation of ascetic practices (dhutaṅga), holding to these practices has a twofold purpose: first, to obtain for oneself a present abode of ease and happiness, so that life is pure and quiet; second, out of compassion for those who come later, so that they may follow, see, hear, and emulate these practices. This twofold purpose is regarded as generally applicable to all specific ascetic practices.

The direction of development for all wholesome states is determined by five basic qualities: having confidence in wholesome states, feeling shame with regard to wholesome states, feeling remorse with regard to wholesome states, diligently exerting oneself for wholesome states, and possessing wisdom regarding wholesome states. If one is endowed with these basic qualities, then by day and by night, one will continually grow in wholesome states without any decline; if one lacks these qualities, then by day and night one will only regress in wholesome states and will not increase.

In practice, a practitioner should learn to maintain a heedful attitude, using heedfulness to counter ignorance and all unwholesome states that arise from ignorance. For this, one must deeply realize the truth of the stream of birth-and-death, arouse a sense of alarm, and establish “abiding in heedfulness” as the core principle of life and practice. Specifically, one must remain alert at all times, not allowing body and mind to scatter, and constantly put this teaching into practice in daily life. Practitioners should also clearly set the goal of abiding in a state of heedfulness and act according to this standard, staying ever watchful and diligently unremitting.

VI. Diligent Effort, Alertness, and Countering Adverse Conditions

In guarding against external harm and internal decline, diligence and a simple life are also key principles. If a practitioner lives in a simple and austere manner, remains alert and not heedless, and with warm, focused intention continues to apply themselves to tasks of practice, then external aggressors will find no opportunity to intrude. Likewise, constantly remaining alert and diligently unremitting is regarded as the one and only correct path to pure liberation.

On the level of human relationships and conduct, knowing gratitude and being thankful are also considered core principles for practitioners. One should have a heart that recognizes kindness and feels gratitude, learning to maintain an attitude of appreciation and to give to others without calculating gain and loss. By contrast, lack of gratitude and thanklessness are serious faults: if a practitioner does not possess a grateful heart, their character is said to fall short even of beasts—this is presented as a powerful warning by way of contrast.

Regarding the definition of diligent effort, a practitioner must strive unremittingly, such that even if the body becomes thin and the flesh and blood dry up, they do not stop; as long as a goal is attainable through human strength, diligence, and exertion, they will not rise from the seat of effort. Practice should not be lax or lazy; it must be supported by full courage, with the ultimate goal of attaining Nibbāna and being freed from all suffering.

When examining attainment in practice, the key points of diligent effort include: exerting oneself day and night without interruption; maintaining clear comprehension and right mindfulness; cutting off all fetters; taking oneself alone as the sole refuge in all circumstances; and seeking the unshakable state. The core principles for realizing Nibbāna state that the practitioner must in sequence go through four stages: associating with a good teacher, hearing the true Dharma, reflecting appropriately, and diligently cultivating. Each earlier stage is a necessary basis for the arising of the next; if any one of these stages is lacking, one will fail to realize Nibbāna in this life.

VII. Non‑Heedlessness Regarding the Faculties and the Arising of Concentration

Regarding heedfulness at the six contact points, the standards differ according to the level of practice. An arahant who has exhausted the taints no longer needs to specially cultivate heedfulness at the six contact points, because the holy life has been fulfilled, what needed to be done has been done, and final liberation has been attained. For those still in the stage of training, however, since they have not yet reached the final goal, and in order to seek the supreme, secure peace of Nibbāna, they must rigorously cultivate heedfulness at the six contact points. The method of practice is this: when the six sense faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind make contact with the six sense objects of forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena, then whether the experience is pleasant or unpleasant, the mind should not give rise to attachment. When the mind does not cling, then firm diligence can arise, unshaken; one maintains clear right mindfulness, the body becomes light and at ease and not agitated, and the mind becomes steady and able to gather into one-pointedness. This is the concrete fruit of heedfulness.

Further explaining diligent effort, the example is given of operating a raft by hands and feet: to reach the far shore, one must continually exert oneself in paddling and cannot give up halfway. In daily practice, during the day, in the first watch of the night, and in the last watch of the night, a practitioner should walk meditation and sit in meditation; during these periods they should either cut off obstructive states or maintain a condition in which they do not arise. During the middle watch of the night, they should lie down on the right side in the lion’s posture and, even before falling asleep, still sustain awareness—whether attentive or inattentive—firmly holding the intention to be mindful upon waking. If a bhikkhu can be diligent without abandoning clear comprehension, then it is precisely in this daily alternation of day and night that he is continually treading the path of liberation.

VIII. Rebirth in Heavenly Realms, the Five Powers, and the Comparison of Faith and Wisdom

Regarding the basic conditions for rebirth in heavenly realms, one who possesses five qualities is regarded as having the characteristics needed for such rebirth. Their common qualities are faith, shame, remorse, and wisdom; the more detailed qualities include being free from anger, free from hatred, free from jealousy, free from stinginess, free from misconduct, as well as being moral, learned, diligent, and mindful in many respects. For laypeople, the principles of household status also mention the composition of five “powers”: the power of good appearance, the power of wealth, the power of relatives, the power of children, and the power of virtue in moral conduct. For a noble female disciple to grow and reach the very highest, most excellent attainment, she must grow in five ways: by growth in faith, in moral discipline, in learning, in generosity, and in wisdom.

Observing the precepts cherished by the noble ones is regarded as the key to rebirth in heavenly realms. Such precepts are unbroken, unruptured, without stain, without blemish, pure and spotless, praised by the wise, and supportive of the arising of meditative concentration. By keeping precepts in this way, one can be reborn in good destinations and heavenly realms. In comparing faith and wisdom, wisdom is explicitly said to surpass faith; for when a person, through personal realization, has attained meditative states, they no longer need to rely on others’ words about the attainment of a concentration without applied and sustained thought or the cessation of applied and sustained thought—they can know this for themselves.

IX. Right View and Wrong View, Ignorance and Wisdom

For liberation, the key lies not only in effort, but also in the correctness of one’s view and direction of practice. If one’s view inclines to the wrong path and one’s practice also follows the wrong path, then one cannot destroy ignorance, cannot give rise to true wisdom, and cannot directly realize Nibbāna. This is like a thorn: if it points in the wrong direction, it will not pierce the hands and feet. Conversely, if one’s view inclines to the right path and one’s practice follows the right path, then one can destroy ignorance, give rise to wisdom, and thereby directly realize Nibbāna, just as a thorn that points the right way will inevitably pierce the hands and feet.

In the dependent arising of mental activity and feeling, there is also a clear connection between diligent effort and attainment. In order to obtain a state not yet obtained, a person must arouse an energetic mind; when one has reached the intended state, then various feelings arise accordingly on the basis of that state. Furthermore, all wholesome states take heedfulness as their root and all equally converge upon heedfulness; therefore heedfulness is called the foremost among all qualities.

X. Precepts, Appropriate Attention, and the Seven Factors of Awakening

In cultivating the seven factors of awakening, moral discipline is regarded as the fundamental basis, while associating with good friends and directing one’s mind with appropriate attention are the preliminary conditions. More broadly, the root of all wholesome states lies in heedfulness and appropriate attention; heedfulness and appropriate attention are the two most important among all wholesome qualities, and precisely by relying on them can one cultivate and fully develop the seven factors of awakening. From a more general perspective, all wholesome states have heedfulness as their root, and heedfulness is the highest among all dharmas—this point is again emphasized.

Regarding the basic foundation for liberation, pure and wholesome precepts and upright view are said to be the two major elements of the initial purification of wholesome states. Among the five spiritual faculties, the faculty of faith is the firm confidence in the Buddha’s awakening, confidence that the Tathāgata is the Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in True Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the Worlds, Unsurpassed Leader of Persons to Be Tamed, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, Blessed One. The faculty of energy is the power of effort obtained by means of the four right exertions. Only when a bhikkhu dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute in effort do these five faculties truly arise.

XI. The Faculty of Wisdom, Concentration, and Liberation

A noble disciple endowed with the faculty of wisdom will naturally be accompanied in practice by several factors: the establishment and maintenance of faith, the exertion and implementation of effort, the clarity and stability of right mindfulness, and the focus and calm of meditative concentration. The basic conditions for the attainment of liberation are composed of two faculties: the noble faculty of wisdom, which knows the true nature of all phenomena as they really are, and the noble faculty of liberation, which is the faculty of concentration that accomplishes one‑pointedness of mind.

The faculty of faith is regarded as the root of all attainments. To have unshakable faith in the Tathāgata and no doubt or hesitation regarding the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata—this is the essential function of the faculty of faith. Precisely because one is established on firm faith, the faculty of energy arises: based on this faith, the practitioner arouses courageous effort, continually abandoning unwholesome states and cultivating wholesome states, and maintains an attitude of no laziness and no turning back. At the same time, all processes of practice undertaken for the sake of taming the mind are directed toward Nibbāna; on this path, the practitioner must arouse firm resolve, exert continuous effort, initiate unremitting exertion, and concentrate the mind without distraction in order to move toward final liberation.

On this basis, moral discipline is regarded as the indispensable foundation for practice: all endeavors in training must be established upon precepts, otherwise they cannot be firmly sustained.

XII. The Foundations of Mindfulness, Stages of Practice, and the Factors of Stream‑Entry

In cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness, one’s attitude must be to practice with ardor, clear comprehension, and right mindfulness, so that observation and recollection remain clear and distinct at all times. In terms of the stages of practice, the status of one still in training is that they have not yet attained final liberation of mind, still aspire to the supreme, secure peace, and are in the stage of cutting off the five hindrances. In such a stage, the practitioner should not be heedless, but must continue striving.

Comparing lay and monastic environments, the basic attitude of a practitioner is also summarized as one of not being heedless. Whether one is living as a householder cultivating wholesome states, or living the monastic life in pursuit of liberation, both require reliance on five factors cultivated in all directions: faith, moral discipline, hearing the teachings, generosity, and wisdom. The core principles for the attainment of four kinds of accomplishment are the same: one must have realized confidence in the Buddha, assured that the Blessed One is Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Perfect in True Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the Worlds, Unsurpassed Leader of Persons to Be Tamed, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, Blessed One; at the same time, one must have realized confidence in the Dharma, and realized confidence in the Saṅgha; and one must possess the moral discipline praised by the noble ones—this discipline is complete and unbroken, without flaw or stain, pure and unmixed, enabling one to be freed from defilements and to gain liberation, praised by the wise, not clinging to the world, and capable of generating meditative concentration that brings inner stability.

Within the content of the blessings that moisten and enrich life, one who is endowed with the virtue of precepts cherished by the noble ones must also possess wisdom, using the insight of the noble ones to direct the mind toward the complete cessation of suffering, thereby realizing insight into the arising and passing away of phenomena. In the concrete practice of purification, it is also pointed out that a practitioner should have firm faith in the Buddha, confident that the Buddha is Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Perfect in True Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the Worlds, Unsurpassed Leader of Persons to Be Tamed, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, Blessed One; likewise, they should have firm faith in the Dharma and in the Saṅgha.

The four factors of stream-entry are regarded as the basic conditions of a noble disciple and include: realized confidence in the Buddha, assured that the Blessed One is Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Perfect in True Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the Worlds, Unsurpassed Leader of Persons to Be Tamed, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, Blessed One; realized confidence in the Dharma; realized confidence in the Saṅgha; and realized confidence in the moral discipline cherished by the noble ones—that is, precepts that are unbroken, unruptured, unmixed, unstained, leading to release, praised by the wise, not clung to, and capable of generating samādhi.

Regarding the causal principles of accomplishment in practice, if one possesses the four factors of stream-entry and, in addition, practices diligently—by day living in seclusion and by night dwelling in silence—then in due sequence there will arise superior rapture, followed by joy, which brings bodily lightness and happiness, leading to mental concentration; then the Dharma manifests, and ultimately such a person is counted among the heedful. Conversely, if, despite possessing the four factors of stream-entry, one does not practice diligently—by day not dwelling in seclusion and by night not dwelling in silence—then superior rapture does not arise, and there is no joy or lightness; one merely abides in suffering, fails to attain concentration, the Dharma does not manifest, and in the end one is counted among the heedless. This principle applies universally to each of the four factors of stream-entry: whether confidence in the Buddha, confidence in the Dharma, confidence in the Saṅgha, or confidence in the noble precepts, all must be brought to fulfillment through diligent practice in order to achieve complete realization.

XIII. Diligence Regarding the Four Noble Truths and the General Condition of Beings’ Morality

Regarding the fundamental principle of diligent effort, a practitioner should arouse the intention to realize the four noble truths that have not yet been fully penetrated, and practice with heightened resolve, unremitting effort, vigorous momentum, unwavering determination, and sustained mindfulness and clear comprehension. The urgency of this diligence is likened to the mindset one would have if one’s clothes or one’s head had caught fire: one would be eager to extinguish the flames without any delay whatsoever.

Finally, concerning the general condition of beings’ observance of precepts, the principle states that the number of beings who are able to stay far from evil conduct is small, while the number of beings who do not stay far from evil conduct is extremely large. This contrast reminds practitioners to cherish moral discipline and wholesome states all the more, and to take heedfulness and diligent effort as their long-term reliance for living securely and for seeking the realization of liberation.
