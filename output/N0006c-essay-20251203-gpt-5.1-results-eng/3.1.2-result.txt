I. Fundamental Obstacles on the Path to Liberation

I.1 The Bondage of Craving, Precepts, and Imbalanced Mental Conduct

On the path to liberation, practitioners first encounter several fundamental obstacles. When the mind is imprisoned by craving, it is dragged about by various desires and cannot be at ease. It clings to and is attached to various objects and states, unwilling to let them go. When the mind is bound by precepts, it becomes attached to the external form of rules and regulations, regarding them as real fetters rather than skillful means to liberation. As a result, one is instead constrained by rules and loses living wisdom and freedom.

Furthermore, when the mind is not tamed, it is difficult to be taught and trained; it cannot be pliant and is unwilling to follow the guidance of the true Dharma. In practice this easily leads to conflict and resistance. Added to this, the interaction of conceit and sensual desire makes practitioners self‑opinionated, giving rise to a sense of superiority and complacency, indulging in sensuality and lacking humility and earnest aspiration for the true path of liberation. These bonds of “imprisoned by craving,” “bound by precepts,” “untamed,” and “conceit combined with sensual desire” together constitute major factors that obstruct liberation.

I.2 Hidden Roots of Obstruction within Instruction and the Holy Life

In the course of practicing the holy life, even genuinely virtuous practitioners of brahmacarya may feel vexed and troubled due to defects or deviations in that very practice. When a practitioner’s understanding of certain aspects of the holy life is not complete, or its application is inappropriate, or there is too much force and repression, then behaviors that ought to lead to purity instead become a mental burden, causing one to be afflicted by the very defects of one’s holy practice.

More seriously, if the mode of instruction itself is wrong, it becomes a direct obstacle to practice. When a guide leads practitioners with deviant views or improper methods, then even with good intentions they may be led in the wrong direction, making it difficult for right holy living to be established, or even causing stagnation and backsliding due to erroneous instruction. Thus, the root of obstacles to the holy life may lie either in the improper manner of one’s own practice, or in mistaken guidance from outside.

II. The Nature of Māra’s Disturbance and the Path of Counteraction

II.1 Manifestations and Intentions of Māra’s Disturbance

In the process of practice, interference from Māra is a reality that must be faced. One aspect of the nature of Māra’s disturbance is to create terrifying scenes and sounds, rendering the practitioner’s eyes and mind obscure. When, during meditation or diligent effort, frightening images or strange sounds appear, these may be manifestations of Māra’s disturbance, whose purpose is to shake the mind so that it cannot abide in right mindfulness and right concentration.

Māra also lays claim to the domain of the senses, as if bringing everything connected with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body under his control, so that when practitioners face forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles, they feel unable to withdraw and are always drawn back into the world of the senses. In this context, Māra knows the practitioner’s thoughts, clearly aware of the movements of their mind and the direction of their effort, and therefore intends to block their liberation, seeking to make them fall back at critical points.

On one occasion, Māra did not merely interfere in the dark, but addressed the Blessed One in verse, asking why a disciple in training would wish to die. Behind this question lay an observation and exploitation of practitioners’ mental states, an attempt to disturb the positive progress of practice by raising the issue of life and death, causing disciples still in training to become confused about life, death, and liberation.

However, when the ultimate state of parinirvāṇa is manifested, Māra is utterly powerless with respect to it. Parinirvāṇa is a state beyond all birth, death, and disturbance; there Māra no longer has any possibility of entering or interfering. After hearing the Blessed One’s teaching, Māra, having received the truth of the doctrine, became sorrowful and defeated, dejected and utterly exhausted in spirit, so that the lute in his hand slipped from his grasp and sank at that very spot—symbolizing that in this dialogue Māra completely retreated and could no longer continue to harass.

II.2 Methods of Counteraction through Right Understanding and Steadfast Mind

To counter Māra’s disturbance and various malicious interferences, practitioners must first establish right understanding. They must clearly recognize the nature of these disturbances and understand that their purpose is to shake one’s confidence and agitate one’s concentration, and that they contain nothing truly frightening in themselves. With clear understanding, one will not be deceived by their outward appearances.

Next, one should understand that by skillfully disciplining body, speech, and mind, one can overcome such interference. When a practitioner, through pure bodily actions, refrains from evil deeds; through wholesome speech, refrains from falsehood and harsh words; and through right mindfulness guards the mind and does not follow after unwholesome thoughts, then inner integrity naturally increases, and Māra’s disturbances lose their conditions for attachment. Thus, by not committing evil deeds, one does not resonate with evil Māras. So long as body, speech, and mind are kept pure, Māra and malicious intent naturally find it hard to draw near.

In strengthening the mind, practitioners need to cultivate a resolve that is not shaken by terrifying scenes. Even when facing the most frightening appearances, the awakened ones feel no fear, because they clearly know that these are nothing more than mental images and illusions, or disturbances from Māra, without real substance. Even if heaven and earth should quake or sharp blades be pressed to the body, the Buddhas are not thereby alarmed, for they have a thorough understanding of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and not‑self, knowing that all these are dependently arisen phenomena, with no inherently fearful nature.

Therefore, practitioners should regard this brief life lightly and no longer cherish this short‑lived body to the point of being controlled by all kinds of fear. Instead, they should make use of their limited life‑force to apply themselves diligently to practice. When one can view the length of life in this way and guard the direction of one’s practice with a firm mind, the power of Māra’s disturbances and all other interferences will naturally be greatly weakened.

At the same time, the core principle of the path to liberation teaches that practitioners should not indulge in sensual pleasures. They should recognize the true nature of malicious interference and firmly maintain a way of practice that keeps a distance from it. If one still allows oneself to revolve in the pleasures of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles, one falls into the sensory domain that Māra claims as his own, thereby making his interference strong and forceful. Only by persistently following a path of practice that is withdrawn from sensual pleasures will one’s steps become steady and unmoving.

III. Obstacles and Transcendence in the Practice of Meditation

III.1 Obstacles and Remedies in the First Jhāna and Higher States of Concentration

In discussing the nature and constituents of the first jhāna, the obstacles to its cultivation are also specifically pointed out. When a practitioner seeks to enter the first jhāna, thoughts and attention connected with desire may still arise, pulling the mind outward toward external objects and disturbing concentration. Such desirous thoughts and scattered attention not only make it difficult for the mind to remain on the object of meditation, they may also gradually strengthen one’s dependence on sensual pleasures, running counter to the direction of liberation.

To counter these obstacles, the further process of realization must firmly establish the mind in the meditative state, training oneself to maintain focused and continuous non‑distraction. When the mind can steadily remain on its chosen object and is no longer shaken by desire and discursive thought, one then has the conditions to transcend coarse states. As concentration deepens, practitioners can again surpass perception of material form, no longer being confined by the physical body and material appearances, and gradually remove dualistic thoughts in the mind, allowing notions such as “self and other,” “inside and outside” to fade away step by step.

In this process, conceptual and discriminative activity with respect to the phenomenal world also gradually ceases. Analysis, judgment, and naming of various objects no longer occupy the dominant position in the mind. When these discriminations have come to a stop, practitioners may realize and abide in the sphere of infinite space, entering a concentration of boundless emptiness, where one is no longer limited by form and color. This is regarded as a higher level of liberating experience.

In subsequent, still higher states of concentration, such as the sphere of infinite consciousness, there are also points requiring special attention. Practitioners should not become heedless with regard to the sphere of infinite consciousness; they must not, upon obtaining an expansive, boundless experience of consciousness, give rise to complacency or attachment, mistakenly assuming they have already reached the ultimate, or become intoxicated by that state and make no further effort to go beyond it. If one becomes heedless in such a state, one easily becomes stuck in a high level of concentration, ceasing to progress and even falling once again into the snares of attachment and conceit.

III.2 Obstacles and Stages of Fulfillment in the Practice of Mindfulness

Within the twofold practice of mental cultivation, the very process of mindfulness‑fixing (fixing the mind on an object) presents a pattern where obstacles and remedies operate in parallel. In mindfulness‑fixing, the first obstacles a practitioner may encounter are instability or inappropriateness of the chosen object, or physical sensations of heat and irritation that make body and mind ill at ease. In addition, the mind may shrink back, unable to raise a firm focus on the object, causing right mindfulness to become scattered and making it impossible to maintain clear, continuous awareness.

To address these obstacles, the practice of mindfulness‑fixing proposes a concrete remedial sequence. The practitioner should first fix the mind on a pure sign, so that the object on which the mind relies is pure and unstained. Such a pure sign can gradually distance the mind from coarse defilements. Once the mind is firmly fixed on this pure sign, a kind of “exalted joy” arises—a joy that surpasses ordinary happiness. This exalted joy then turns into a gentler and more sustained gladness, bringing a sense of ease and delight to the mind.

As this joy continues, the body gradually develops a feeling of lightness and ease, as if body and mind have become lighter and the coarse pressure and tension are slowly released. From bodily lightness there arises a more refined pleasure, making the practitioner more willing to abide in meditation. Ultimately, through this sequence of changes, the mind becomes more stable and at peace, entering a state of mental concentration.

When such mindfulness‑fixing has reached fulfillment, the practitioner uses reflection to ascertain whether the mind has truly been established at the point of fixation—namely, examining whether the mind is firmly abiding on the pure sign and no longer easily drifting away. Once this is confirmed, the practitioner can gather back the previously scattered mind and let it rest in a deeper stillness, further reaching the state of non‑applied and non‑sustained thought, no longer engaging in coarse (applied) or subtle (sustained) examination of objects, but simply abiding. At this time, the mind possesses both mindfulness and happiness; in this state of “fullness of mindfulness and joy,” mindfulness‑fixing can be said to have attained its stage‑wise completion.

IV. Four Forms of Deviation in Practice

IV.1 Excessive Withdrawal and Excessive Striving

With regard to the degree of effort in practice, if it is not properly regulated, special forms of deviation arise. One is excessive withdrawal: when practitioners are overly lax and cannot arouse a spirit of diligence, this withdrawn state co‑arises and accords with sloth and torpor. That is, once the mind inclines toward withdrawal, it easily interlocks with traits of laziness, procrastination, and lack of motivation, causing practice to stagnate and making progress difficult.

Opposed to this is excessive striving, which occurs when practitioners push themselves beyond what body and mind can bear. Excessive striving co‑arises and accords with restlessness. When the mind is forced too hard, it easily becomes agitated and unsettled; attention jumps ceaselessly among various objects and cannot rest in calm, so that mental restlessness greatly increases and one is driven ever further from meditative concentration.

IV.2 Contraction Inward and Distraction Outward

Apart from too much or too little effort, the direction of practice may also become skewed. “Contraction inward” refers to the mind tightening too much inwardly, resulting in a dull, rigid, inward‑turned state. This contracted mindset co‑arises and accords with drowsiness, rendering the mind heavy and lacking clarity. Although it may seem not to be moving outward, it also loses the brightness and vitality of awareness.

In contrast, “distraction outward” refers to the mind being overly diffused outward, especially by expanding toward the five external kinds of delightful objects—in other words, being drawn by the attractiveness of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles. When the mind remains long indulged in these five kinds of sense pleasures, it is very hard to return to inner abiding, thus falling into the extreme of distraction and straying further and further from the path of liberation.

When practitioners can clearly discern these four deviant states—excessive withdrawal, excessive striving, contraction inward, and distraction outward—they can adjust body and mind in actual practice in a timely way, no longer being led by these deviations, but returning to the right practice of the Middle Way. In this way, the previously mentioned obstacles to liberation, disturbances from Māra, and deviations within meditative states can all be gradually resolved and transcended.
