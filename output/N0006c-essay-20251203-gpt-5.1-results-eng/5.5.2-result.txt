<title> The Guidance of the Liberated One and the Virtuous Realm of Accomplished Practice </title>

I. The Guiding Role of the Liberated One  
A truly liberated person will inevitably, in actual conduct, take on the responsibility of guiding sentient beings. He not only walks the path of liberation himself, but also leads the multitude forward, guiding the masses toward the correct direction. This kind of guidance is not abstract preaching, but a matter of actually walking at the forefront within the community, so that beings can follow in his footsteps and advance along the road he has opened.

Under such guidance, sentient beings do not remain on this shore of the cycle of birth and death, but are directed toward the “far shore beyond the Lord of Death.” The leadership of the liberated one gives his followers the opportunity to cross beyond the boundary of birth-and-death and the Lord of Death, and to move toward another realm. Such leadership is a clear directional guidance, so that beings no longer merely passively face birth and death, but step by step advance toward the further shore that transcends birth and death.

At the same time, the guidance of the liberated one is also manifested in helping beings sever the bondage of the “clutches of Māra.” What he does is not only outward leadership, but also guiding beings away from the influence and control of Māra, enabling them to free themselves from the state of being constrained by his grasp. Through his guidance, beings are no longer tightly held by Māra’s hand, but gain the opportunity to break free, cut off this bondage, and gradually move toward freedom and liberation.

II. The Virtuous Realm of Accomplished Practice  
When a practitioner truly reaches the realm of accomplished practice, there is inevitably a corresponding perfection in virtue. Such accomplishment in virtue makes him not only a practitioner, but also a genuine heir to the True Dharma. What he inherits is not a merely nominal transmission, but, through his virtue and cultivation, he in fact shoulders the responsibility of continuing the True Dharma, becoming its bearer in the human world.

As his virtue becomes complete, such a practitioner also possesses great moral and spiritual authority. His authority is not external power, but an inner strength and the prestige that radiate from his virtue, naturally arousing respect and trust in others. This great moral and spiritual authority is accumulated through long-term practice and virtue, enabling him, when facing sentient beings and the True Dharma, to exercise a stable and powerful influence.

When virtue reaches such a level, this practitioner then possesses the qualifications of a fully accomplished cultivator. He is no longer merely at some stage within the process of practice, but has attained the full standard that the path requires. These complete qualifications arise naturally after becoming an heir of the True Dharma and possessing great moral and spiritual authority, revealing that in both practice and virtue he has already attained perfect accomplishment.
