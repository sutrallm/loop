<title> A Comprehensive Exposition on Giving and Stinginess, Merit and Karmic Results </title>
<article>

I. The Faults of Stinginess and the Fundamental Value of Giving

I.1 The Faults of Stinginess and Negligence

Stinginess and negligence make people unwilling to practice giving; they constantly fear that in the future they may suffer hunger, thirst, and other painful results. Because foolish people are miserly and selfish, they find it hard to be free from suffering and gain happiness in this life and the next, and will in the end meet with all kinds of painful situations. Therefore, stinginess should be thoroughly subdued and eliminated; it must not be allowed to grow in the mind. Only by abandoning miserliness can one truly begin to practice giving, and the practice of giving can conquer the defilements in one’s heart, counteracting greed and the habitual tendency toward negligence.

I.2 The Basic Merits of Giving and the Key Mental Attitude

Giving itself is a friendly and wholesome act, a virtuous deed endowed with merit and fortunate results. It not only becomes a basis for happiness in future lives, but is also the crucial root from which all good qualities arise and grow. Those who understand the karmic results of giving and who aspire to merit should understand in this way and genuinely put it into practice. 

The key to giving is to practice it with pure faith and a proper attitude, rather than being controlled by stinginess and negligence, hiding behind excuses to refuse to give. When a person can take faith as a forerunner and act in accordance with the true Dharma in giving, he steps onto the right path of accumulating good fortune and purifying his own mind.

II. Giving in Poverty and Discriminating Giving

II.1 The Merit of Giving by Those in Poverty

Even if one lives in poverty, if one can still practice giving based on faith, the merit is extremely extraordinary. In the midst of a harsh life, a poor person may be forced to glean scattered grain just to sustain himself and support his family. Yet as long as he can arouse the mind of giving in such a situation and actually carry it out, the merit he accumulates can be reckoned as a thousandfold, benefiting others and bringing happiness to himself as well. Such giving is by no means diminished in value by poverty; on the contrary, in the measure of the true Dharma it is regarded as genuine wholesome karma and pure, correct Dharma.

II.2 The Value of Discriminating Giving

“Discriminating giving” refers to giving that is carried out with proper discernment and wisdom. This kind of giving is a wholesome deed praised by the Well-Gone One and is worthy of respect and offerings in this world. Discriminating giving brings about vast and far-reaching results, like sowing seeds in fertile fields: the seeds fall onto soil well-suited for growth and are bound to yield abundant harvests. Therefore, when giving is guided by wisdom and one chooses the right recipients and manner, the resulting merit becomes even greater.

III. Correct Giving Compared with Sacrificial Offerings

III.1 Correct Giving Surpasses Harmful Sacrifices

Truly correct, Dharma-based giving produces merit far surpassing that of lavish sacrificial offerings based on harming living beings. Even if a person sets up thousands upon thousands of sacrifices in great display, yet bases them on killing, harming, and tormenting living beings—causing them fear and making them weep—such wrong conduct does not equal even a fraction of the merit of one act of correct giving. It may even be said that no matter how great the slaughter in animal sacrifices, it cannot compare to even one-sixteenth of the merit of giving in accordance with the Dharma. From this we see that sacrifices achieved through violence and coercion not only fail to bring great benefit, but are far inferior to acts of giving born from compassion and a pure heart.

III.2 Types of Sacrifices and the Difference between Wholesome and Unwholesome

One kind of sacrifice uses the killing of living beings as its means—for example, killing cows, sheep, goats, and various other livestock, sometimes on a large scale. These actions are accompanied by coercion and terror: beings lose their lives in fright and panic. Therefore, the resulting karmic fruit is extremely small and does not possess great results.

By contrast, another kind of sacrifice involves no killing of living beings at all, but follows the right path, staying far away from violence and coercion. Externally such offerings may appear simple and not at all ostentatious, but if they are practiced consistently, they bring great karmic results and are truly wholesome actions that will by no means be in vain.

III.3 Sacrificial Rites Praised by the Noble Ones and Those Not Observed

Some forms of sacrifice—such as stick-throwing contests, human sacrifices, horse sacrifices, and the so-called “Drink of the Victors”—involve killing or harming living beings and thus are not practiced by the Noble Ones, nor are they approved by the wise. In contrast, there are sacrificial offerings practiced by the wise and noble: they do not rely on killing, but are pure, upright, and in harmony with the true Dharma, and therefore receive the praise of the gods. Only such offerings, praised by the Noble Ones and the gods, are truly great sacrifices endowed with abundant merit.

IV. The World in Flames and the Fundamental Meaning of Giving

IV.1 The Fire of Aging and Death and the Choice of the Wise

The entire world is burned by the fierce fire of aging and death; all life is pressed by impermanence and decay. No matter how much wealth one has or how strong and healthy one’s body is, when death comes these cannot be taken along. The wise understand this truth, knowing the ultimate fate of wealth and the body. Thus they choose to make good use of their resources while they can: on the one hand, enjoying them to a reasonable extent, and on the other, skillfully giving, thereby subduing the stinginess in their hearts and overcoming attachment and afflictions.

IV.2 The Karmic Results of Giving and the Support of Merit

Giving brings about the karmic result of happiness; those who are stingy in giving or do not give at all forfeit this cause of happiness. The merit accomplished through giving is a crucial support by which beings in future lives can cross the sea of suffering and escape hardship. If a person only knows how to amass wealth and refuses to share, he is like someone piling up a heavy burden that will only add encumbrance in the cycle of birth and death. Conversely, using giving to accumulate merit is the true provision that opens a safe and peaceful path for oneself in future lives.

V. The Content, Manner, and Recipients of Giving

V.1 What Is Given and the Corresponding Benefits

In concrete terms, giving food brings the result of strength; giving clothing leads to the result of beauty and a dignified appearance; giving vehicles leads to the result of comfort and convenience; giving lights yields clear and keen eyesight. Going further, giving dwellings is equivalent to giving all necessities, because dwellings gather together many of the conditions upon which life depends. Teaching the true Dharma is considered a gift of the “Deathless” Dharma—the gift of the path to liberation, giving others the opportunity to leave birth and death behind.

V.2 Mental Attitude in Giving and the Resulting Good Fortune

When giving, one should practice with pure faith, not with defiled motives or a reluctant mind. If one gives with pure faith, one gains happiness and good fortune in this life, and likewise reaps good results in future lives. The value of giving lies not only in the material things given, but even more in whether one’s mind is pure and whether one gives with respect and compassion. When the giver single-mindedly focuses on wholesome intentions, the merit obtained is deep and stable.

V.3 The Wide Range of Suitable Recipients

The range of recipients of giving is extremely broad: it includes renunciants, brahmins, the poor and pitiable, travelers on the road, the homeless, and all those who beg. Whatever goods in one’s home are suitable to give should be given without discrimination to those who keep precepts and practice wholesome Dharma, so that resources are truly used to support virtuous people. Giving should not be limited to certain identities; with a compassionate mind one should observe the needs of beings: anyone worthy of help and in need of support can become an object of giving.

VI. The Increase, Spread, and Characteristics of Merit

VI.1 Encouraging and Promoting Giving

If one wishes the wholesome practice of giving to spread widely, one should actively praise the merits of giving, helping others understand its benefits and value, and at the same time provide them with opportunities to give, creating conditions suitable for good deeds. Even when one does not have the ability to give directly, one can still accumulate merit by supporting others in their giving and helping them do good. As long as one genuinely intends to uphold wholesome deeds so that giving continues unbroken, the merit is likewise profound.

VI.2 The Continuity of Giving and the Inexhaustibility of Merit

If one perseveres in the wholesome practice of giving over a long time, the karmic results of this merit have no end. As time goes by, the merit formed through long-term practice does not disappear; all these wholesome deeds will ripen into corresponding results. The fruits of this merit can continue to manifest in heavenly realms, allowing the doer of good to enjoy happiness there for a long time, without a fixed ultimate limit. The wholesome causes planted through giving do not wither with the passage of time; instead, they ripen again and again, becoming a long-term support.

VI.3 Sources of Merit and Pure Conditions

Those who keep precepts and abide in the true Dharma see their merit grow day and night and are able, when life ends, to be reborn in heavenly realms. Concrete wholesome deeds that increase merit include building gardens, planting trees, building bridges, digging wells, and providing drinking water and shelter. These actions may seem like mere provision of convenience and comfort for others, but in fact they form solid sources of merit, enabling the practitioner’s wholesome karma to continually grow and to produce abundant fruits in future lives.

VII. Comparative Karmic Results of Stinginess and Giving

VII.1 Characteristics of the Stingy and Their Bad Results

Those who are stingy and miserly often revile beggars, harbor aversion toward those who come seeking help, and not only refuse to give themselves but also obstruct others from giving, making it hard for good deeds to be carried out. Such conduct creates extremely heavy karmic results: in the future they will be reborn in the hell realms, as animals, or in the world of Yama and other evil destinies. Even if they are once again reborn human, they will be born into extremely poor families, finding it hard to obtain clothing, food, and various pleasures, constantly lacking and severely constrained.

VII.2 Characteristics of the Generous and Their Good Results

In contrast, if a person is deeply compassionate, far removed from stinginess, and has deep faith and reverence toward the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, his karmic results will be very different. Such a practitioner will in the future be reborn in radiant heavenly realms, enjoying pure and sublime heavenly bliss. If he is again reborn as a human, he will be born into a wealthy family, easily obtaining clothing, food, and various enjoyments, and easily enjoying the fruits of good fortune accumulated by himself and others in the past. The difference in results between generosity and miserliness is clearly seen from this.

VIII. The Quality of Recipients and the True Meaning of Offerings

VIII.1 The Size of Merit and the Spiritual Level of Recipients

The size of the merit and karmic results produced by giving depends on the spiritual attainment of the recipient. If one offers to those whose precepts are pure, the resultant merit is vast; if one gives to those whose ethical conduct is deficient, the result is far less. In particular, when one gives to practitioners who are both “free of five kinds of hindrances” and “endowed with five kinds of spiritual attainments,” the merit and karmic results are especially great, incomparable to ordinary giving.

VIII.2 Worthy Ones as Recipients and Fields of Supreme Merit

In the actual practice of offerings, correct offerings must fulfill several conditions. First, the object of offering should be someone who has realized the noble path—someone who has truly attained the noble fruit and completed the path of liberation. Second, the manner and content of the offering must accord with the path of practice and not contradict the true Dharma. Third, offerings must be supported by pure faith, not by a desire for fame, gain, or worldly rewards. Only offerings of this kind can help the one who offers to cross beyond the torrent of birth and death, gain happiness in future lives, and accumulate supreme and stable merit.

VIII.3 Motivation for Offerings and the Fundamental Intention of the Buddhas’ Teaching

The motivation for offerings should not be to obtain something in return; one must not treat giving as a tool of exchange for benefits. The Noble Ones do not teach the Dharma for the sake of food and material offerings; the Buddhas do not recite verses and teach in order to obtain food, nor do they use the Dharma they teach to scold or bargain over the price of offerings. The fully awakened Great Ones, who have exhausted all outflows and whose conduct is pure, dwell in peace and quiescence and are the most supreme field of merit in the world. Serving such Noble Ones and making food offerings to them is in itself an immense merit and does not require any worldly terms of exchange.

VIII.4 Principles for Handling Leftover Sacrificial Food

In the context of offerings, there are special rules for certain leftover sacrificial foods. Apart from the Tathāgata and the Tathāgata’s disciples, no one can truly “digest” these leftover sacrificial foods, because they carry a special nature of offering and a meaning of merit. Therefore, if there are no suitable recipients, these leftover offerings should be discarded in a place without grass, or sunk into water where there are no insects, in order to avoid harming living beings and also to express respect for the offering itself.

VIII.5 Worthy Recipients and the Great Karmic Results of Offerings

When giving and offering are directed to people endowed with specific noble qualities, the karmic results will be extremely great. Offerings made to such recipients are not depleted; rather, like great trees growing in fertile soil, they flourish more and more, with merit constantly increasing. Hence, choosing proper, worthy recipients is a crucial key to making the merit of giving ripen into great results.

IX. Precepts, Monastic Requisites, and the Merit of Giving Food

IX.1 Benefits in This Life for Those Who Keep Precepts

A person who keeps the precepts purely already gains clear benefits in this present life. His body and mind are at ease, undisturbed by guilt, without inner remorse or fear; he will be respected by others, and his good name will spread among people; at the same time, he stays away from various evil conditions and unwholesome environments and frequently meets good friends and spiritual teachers. These karmic results in this very life show that keeping precepts not only prepares the way for future lives, but is also an important condition for happiness here and now.

IX.2 Practice of the Dharma and the True Benefit to Those Who Hear It

In the practice of the Dharma, as long as one genuinely acts according to the teachings, both the practitioner and those who hear the true Dharma can obtain real benefit. The practice of the Dharma is not confined to inner cultivation; it is also concretely expressed through giving and making offerings, so that giver, recipient, and hearer of the Dharma all benefit.

IX.3 The Merit of Giving Food When the Recipient Is Liberated

The merit of giving food is fully manifested only when certain conditions are present. First, the recipient of the offering must be a practitioner who has already freed himself from all fetters, truly liberated from defilements and bonds. Second, the act of offering must be concretely carried out as giving food. When these two conditions are fulfilled, the merit acquired by the donor is extremely supreme, manifold, and vast—not limited to one time and place, but providing long-term support for the donor’s wholesome karma. The ideal donor should be endowed with virtuous character and sincere faith so that the giving he practices is truly complete and pure.

IX.4 The Meaning of Monastic Requisites and Their Vast Results

For monastic practitioners, the requisites they use—robes, food, bedding, and medicine—appear outwardly to be ordinary items, nothing special. However, precisely because these items are used in the pursuit of the path, supporting the practice of morality, concentration, and wisdom, they can bring vast karmic results and benefits. For practitioners, such requisites are conditions supporting the continued presence of the true Dharma in the world; for donors, providing these seemingly ordinary requisites can yield extraordinary merit.

X. Giving and the Fulfillment of Specific Rebirth Aspirations

X.1 Aspiration for Rebirth among Dragon Beings and the Role of Giving

If a being gives rise to a specific aspiration regarding future rebirth—for example, wishing to be reborn among a certain class of dragon beings—then, based on this aspiration, further practice of giving helps bring about that desired rebirth. Items suitable for giving include food, drink, clothing, vehicles, flower garlands, incense, perfumes and unguents, bedding, dwellings, and lamps. Through these concrete acts of giving, one can strengthen and enhance the karmic conditions that support the aspiration, thereby paving the way for the desired rebirth.

X.2 Karmic Basis for Rebirth as a Garuḍa and the Enhancing Role of Giving

Likewise, if a being has a particular karmic basis and mental orientation, aspiring to be reborn as a specific class of garuḍa (mythical golden-winged bird), then, on the basis of this aspiration and karma, further giving can also stabilize and enhance its fulfillment. In this case, the giving similarly includes food, drink, clothing, vehicles, flower garlands, incense, perfumes and unguents, bedding, dwellings, and lamps. When these acts of giving accord with the aspiration in one’s heart, then at the time of death one can be reborn as desired among the group of garuḍas one has longed for.

X.3 Giving Fragrances and Rebirth in Corresponding Fragrance Heavens

If someone wishes to be reborn in heavenly realms that are based on particular kinds of fragrance, this too can be accomplished through giving. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by root fragrance, one should frequently give root fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by heartwood fragrance, one should often give heartwood fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by sapwood fragrance, one should often give sapwood fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by bark fragrance, one should frequently give bark fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by bud fragrance, one should constantly give bud fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by leaf fragrance, one should frequently give leaf fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by flower fragrance, one should often give flower fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by fruit fragrance, one should constantly give fruit fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by liquid fragrance, one should frequently give liquid fragrances. If one wishes to be reborn in the heaven where beings abide supported by “fragrance-of-fragrance,” one should constantly give fragrance-of-fragrance.

X.4 Giving Various Items and Rebirth in the Fragrance Heavens

Besides fragrances themselves, one may also rely on giving a variety of items, combined with the aspiration for rebirth in particular fragrance heavens, from the root-fragrance heaven up to the fragrance-of-fragrance heaven. If one extensively gives food and drink, clothing, vehicles, flower garlands, incense, perfumes and unguents, bedding, dwellings, and lamps, while at the same time fulfilling wholesome conduct of body, speech, and mind, and clearly directing one’s aspiration toward the fragrance heaven in which one wishes to be reborn, then at death one will be reborn in that heavenly realm and enjoy the pure and blissful results corresponding to the fragrances one has given.

XI. Use of Wealth, the Attitude toward Gold and Silver, and the Non-Destruction of Family Property

XI.1 Proper Ways to Use Wealth

In using wealth, there should be two main directions. On the one hand, one may use resources to bring joy and happiness to oneself and others, making life reasonably comfortable and avoiding extreme hardship that throws one off balance. On the other hand, one should make good use of wealth in giving, so that resources become tools for benefiting beings rather than mere means for amassing enjoyment. In this way, wealth can both bring appropriate happiness and be transformed into sublime merit.

XI.2 The True Benefit of Giving without Harming Family Property

Some people worry that giving will harm their family property, but this is not actually the case. Truly correct, Dharma-based giving will not lead to the ruin of one’s household; rather, it is the most genuine source of wealth and good fortune. Through giving, the treasure and grain in one’s home tend toward abundance, and the signs of prosperity become more secure. Giving turns wealth into the provisions of wholesome karma, thereby continually attracting further prosperity and happiness in days to come.

XI.3 The Attitude of Renunciants toward Gold, Silver, and the Five Desires

For śramaṇas, disciples of the Śākya, gold and silver are regarded as impure and should be stayed away from; they should not accept or take them, and should also abandon various jewels such as māṇi-gems and gold. This is because if one were to acknowledge gold and silver as pure, it would be tantamount to acknowledging the five sensual desires as pure, and such a stance would contradict the renunciant path of the Śākya disciples, who seek liberation and freedom from desire. Thus, the careful and rejecting attitude of renunciants toward gold and silver is precisely to prevent themselves from being tainted by the five desires.

XII. The Lay Disciple’s Freedom from Stinginess, Joy in Giving, and the Path to Stream-Entry

XII.1 Four Factors and Joyful Giving among Blessings and Merits

In some teachings, there are four particularly emphasized factors, which, if fulfilled, lead to deep blessings and merit. One of these is being endowed with giving and generosity. Practitioners must be free from stinginess and defiled minds: even while living at home, they should frequently practice giving, and personally give, not merely have others do it on their behalf. They should feel joy in relinquishing possessions, gladly respond with gifts to those who beg, and rejoice in sharing and distributing everything they have. 

In another set of teachings on four kinds of blessings and merit, the same practice of freedom from stinginess and joy in giving is emphasized: while dwelling at home, one continues to give, personally hands over gifts, gladly relinquishes possessions, happily responds to those in need, and enjoys sharing what one has with others.

XII.2 The Lay Follower’s Fullness in Renunciation

For a lay follower (upāsaka), to be called “complete in five respects,” one of the requirements is “fullness in renunciation.” Fullness in renunciation means that in one’s heart one is free of stinginess and defilement, frequently practicing giving within household life—not merely agreeing with giving in words, but personally handing over what is given and joyfully relinquishing one’s possessions. When someone comes to beg, one responds with joy, without annoyance, and gladly divides and shares all that is appropriate to share, regarding one’s own wealth as a wholesome cause to be jointly enjoyed.

XII.3 Pure Giving as a Core Factor for Stream-Entry

In another teaching on attaining the fruit of stream-entry, it is said that if a noble disciple fully accomplishes four core factors, he can realize the stage of stream-entry, from then on avoiding inevitable downfall and becoming firmly established on the right path, progressing toward final awakening. One of these factors is “the practice of pure giving.” This kind of giving requires the practitioner to be inwardly free of stinginess and defilement; even while living at home, he still continues to practice giving and must personally carry it out, not just praise it verbally. He must generate genuine joy in relinquishing and sharing, and willingly extend his giving to all who ought to be supported, so that the good deed is not limited to a small number of recipients.

XIII. The Moistening Power of Merit and the Accumulation of Immeasurable Good

XIII.1 The Complete Result of the Moistening Power of Merit

When a noble disciple has fully accomplished the four kinds of “moistening power of merit” discussed above—which include pure giving and joyful freedom from stinginess—then the merit he possesses is beyond reckoning, an immeasurable, countless mass of great merit. Such merit is not easily exhausted; instead, it continues in this life and the next to moisten and nourish the practitioner’s body, mind, and destiny. The combined merits accumulated through giving, keeping precepts, protecting the Dharma, and maintaining a pure mind are like an inexhaustible spring, long nurturing the path of practice and ultimately leading to the final fruit of liberation and peace.
