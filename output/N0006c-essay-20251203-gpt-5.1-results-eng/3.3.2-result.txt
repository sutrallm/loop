<title> Supernormal Powers, the Four Bases of Spiritual Power, and the Four Establishments of Mindfulness: A Comprehensive Account of the Virtues and Realms of Noble Ones </title>
<article>
I. The Fundamental Realms of the Liberated and the Noble Ones

I.1 The Liberated One’s Skilled Cultivation and Free Use of Supernormal Powers  
A truly liberated practitioner will certainly have become skilled in cultivating various supernormal transformations. He not only realizes supernormal powers, but can also wield them freely, manifesting them in accordance with his intention and delight, as a natural outflow of his liberated state. When he obtains great supernormal power and great might, he reaches realms that all ordinary people and those not yet accomplished have never before attained, brings to completion the supreme and unsurpassed holy life, and in this very life personally knows and experiences all of this, rather than remaining merely at the level of conjecture or faith.

I.2 Great Supernormal Power, Great Might, and the Supreme Holy Life  
The accomplishment of a practitioner endowed with great supernormal power and great might is extremely hard to obtain. He can reach realms that have never before been reached, truly accomplish the unsurpassed, purified holy life, and in the here-and-now see and know this for himself, with unshakable certainty. Such an accomplishment is by no means easy; only through long-term practice and repeated cultivation can it be fully perfected. Precisely for this reason, anyone who can completely accomplish great supernormal power and great might is usually regarded as having attained the most sublime and most difficult-to-obtain fruits and virtues of practice.

I.3 The Noble One’s Perfect Wisdom, the Three Knowledges, and Worthiness of Offerings  
In terms of inner wisdom, a true noble one possesses the three knowledges in full perfection. He understands the various past-life destinies of himself and of other beings, clearly knowing how their lifetimes have flowed on in the past. He not only knows the names, identities, and activities of himself and others, but also grasps the lengths of their lives and the causes and conditions for their gathering and dispersal. He can directly see the heavenly realms and the states of woe, and other kinds of realms of existence, clearly discerning the karmic relations by which beings journey back and forth between heavens and the various states of misery, understanding the fundamental causes from which the happiness of gods and the sufferings of the woeful states arise. More importantly, he has completely brought to an end the root of saṁsāric life, cutting off the very factors that cause the stream of birth and death, reaching the state in which these roots are exhausted. Thus he accomplishes the noble one’s perfect wisdom and virtue.

Only one who possesses such complete mastery of the three knowledges can truly be called a noble one, and can qualify as “worthy of offerings.” Such a noble one not only knows his own past, but can know the past-life destinies of beings, can directly see the worlds of the gods and all kinds of woeful realms, discern the many forms and situations of beings dwelling among them, and at the same time has fully accomplished various supernormal powers. When all his taints are exhausted, and he has obtained taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, he not only possesses perfect wisdom, but abides in it here and now. Thus his virtue and supernormal powers alike become proper causes for beings to rely upon and make offerings to.

II. The Buddha and His Disciples’ Display of Supernormal Powers in the Brahmā World

II.1 The Buddha’s Display of Supernormal Powers and the Fire-Element Attainment  
When confronted with some Brahmās’ mistaken views about their own status and the ultimate origin of the cosmos, the Buddha did not merely admonish them with words, but skillfully appeared by means of supernormal power as a means of instruction. By his supernormal power, in an instant he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and at once appeared in the Brahmā world, seated cross-legged in midair above that Brahmā’s head, and entered the attainment of the fire element. In this attainment, the Buddha used the great concentration and supernormal might he had realized as the fundamental way to demonstrate to Brahmā his true virtues and right view.

II.2 The Four Great Disciples’ Display of the Fire-Element Attainment in the Four Directions  
To further assist in teaching and in dispelling the Brahmā’s wrong notions, the Buddha’s disciples likewise each displayed their own supernormal attainments. The Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana came from the east and, seated cross-legged in midair below the Buddha’s position, likewise entered the attainment of the fire element; the Venerable Mahākāśyapa came from the south and sat cross-legged in midair at a level beneath the Buddha, entering the fire-element attainment; the Venerable Mahākapphiṇa appeared from the west, sat cross-legged in midair below the Buddha, and entered the fire-element attainment; the Venerable Aniruddha then appeared from the north, sitting cross-legged in midair at a height below the Buddha’s seat, and also entered the attainment of the fire element. The four great disciples took up the four directions of east, south, west, and north, each displaying a fire-element attainment of the same type, forming a majestic scene with the Buddha at the center and the four disciples supporting the four directions.

II.3 The Purpose of the Display of Supernormal Powers and the Teaching in the Brahmā World  
The Buddha and these disciples together displayed such comprehensive great supernormal power and great might not merely to show their abilities, but in order to correct the Brahmā’s mistaken ideas about himself and the cosmos. Through this manifestation, they enabled the Brahmā to see with his own eyes that, even in the Brahmā world which he regarded as supreme, the Buddha and his disciples could come and go freely, appearing and vanishing at will, thus awakening him to the fact that he was not the ultimate lord, still less the absolute source of all things.

When a noble one is endowed with great supernormal power and great might, he can freely teach the Dhamma in the Brahmā world, unconstrained by the realm of earth or heaven. He can let his voice permeate a thousand world-systems, so that beings in a thousand world-systems all hear the Dhamma. Furthermore, according to beings’ faculties and conditions, he may teach the Dhamma by appearing fully in person, or without appearing at all and only letting his voice be heard, or by appearing only half his body while teaching. By such various ways of appearing and not appearing, of bodily manifestation and non-manifestation, he draws beings in and leads them to liberation in the Dhamma.

III. The Six Kinds of Supernormal Knowledge and Extraordinary Perception

III.1 The Content of the Six Kinds of Supernormal Knowledge  
After a noble one has completed his cultivation, he can realize the six kinds of supernormal knowledge. First is the knowledge of supernormal transformation: he can become many from one body, and from many again become one body; he can appear and vanish freely without obstruction; he can pass through walls and barriers, and cross over mountain cliffs as if walking through empty space; he can appear and disappear within the great earth as a man goes in and out of water; he can walk upon the surface of water without sinking, as if walking on solid ground; he can sit cross-legged in midair and walk about at ease, like a bird flying freely in the sky; he can even touch the sun and moon with his hand and, by the majestic power of his body, reach the Brahmā world, so that his bodily power extends to the Brahmā realm. All these transformations are included in the knowledge of supernormal transformation.

Next is the knowledge of the divine ear. With a purified, even superhuman, divine-ear faculty, he can hear the various sounds of beings in the human world and in the heavenly worlds, whether near or far, in this region or in other regions, clearly distinguishing all sounds. Next is the knowledge of others’ minds. With his own mind he directly understands the mental states of others, knowing whether they have greed or are free of greed; have hatred or anger, or are free of hatred and anger; have delusion or are free of delusion. He knows whether their minds are concentrated and collected, or scattered and distracted; he can discern whether their minds are expansive or not expansive, superior or not superior, concentrated or not concentrated, and even without concentration; and whether they are minds of liberation or minds not yet liberated. He can accurately grasp these many different kinds of mental distinctions.

Next is the knowledge of past lives. He can recollect the various former abodes of himself and even of others. He can recall one life, two lives, three lives, four lives, five lives, ten lives, twenty lives, thirty lives, forty lives, fifty lives, a hundred lives, a thousand lives, a hundred thousand lives, up to one life to a hundred thousand lives; and further recall many eons of dissolution, many eons of evolution, and many eons of evolution-and-dissolution, and remember the various circumstances experienced in those eons of evolution, dissolution, and evolution-and-dissolution. He knows in detail the content of his past abodes, including names, clans, bodily color and appearance, the food he ate, the pleasures and pains he underwent, the length of his life, as well as the place where he died and the place where he was reborn, the places where he vanished and was reborn, the forms he took and the regions he was in. Even the modes of conduct and the names in each life, he can remember distinctly, without missing a hair’s breadth.

The knowledge of the divine eye enables him, with a purified, even superhuman divine eye, to observe the death and rebirth of all beings. He sees beings dying here and being reborn elsewhere, according to the differences in the heaviness or lightness of their karma, taking rebirth in low or high, inferior or superior, beautiful or ugly, fortunate or unfortunate states. Those who, by body, speech, and mind commit unwholesome actions will, following their karma, fall into realms of suffering and states of woe; those who, by body, speech, and mind perform wholesome actions will be reborn in heavenly realms and other happy destinations. With his purified divine eye, he clearly understands how beings take birth in various realms according to their own karmic results, and he sees without confusion everything that happens between their death and rebirth.

In addition, the practitioner whose cultivation is complete also obtains a purified divine-eye knowledge, by which he can carefully observe the causes and results in the stream of birth and death of beings; and by the knowledge of past lives he understands all his own past-life destinies. Combined with the use of the knowledge of others’ minds, he can skillfully understand the mental states of other beings, accurately discerning their various convictions, thought-tendencies, and inner motives, so that when teaching he does not employ the wrong skillful means.

III.2 The Use of the Purified Divine Eye, Divine Ear, and Knowledge of Others’ Minds  
When a virtuous noble one has obtained the purified divine eye and purified divine ear, he can perceive at a distance and hear voices at a distance, and even converse at a distance, without moving his body. Without personally going to other worlds, he can, through the purified divine ear, hear the voices of gods and humans both near and far, and with the purified divine eye see the conduct and karmic results of beings in distant places. In terms of purity, this ability is on a par with what the Blessed One possesses, for it is with the same superhuman divine-eye and divine-ear faculties that he unobstructedly observes the many realms of humans and gods. As for the knowledge of others’ minds, it enables the practitioner, when teaching beings, first to know the greed, hatred, and delusion in their minds, and whether or not they are liberated, and then administer an appropriate medicine of the Dhamma. The scriptures also state that a practitioner can know the mental states of other sentient beings, for example whether or not they have greed, whether or not their minds have become liberated, and so on; these are the virtues that appear through this knowledge.

III.3 Contemplating the Karmic Relations of Heavenly Realms and States of Woe  
Relying on the knowledge of past lives and the knowledge of the divine eye, a noble one not only knows his own past, but can also penetrate the many comings and goings of beings in countless lifetimes, directly seeing the truth of the heavenly realms and the woeful states, and understanding how the blessings of heavenly realms are formed and how the suffering of woeful realms arises. He sees that when beings, by body, speech, and mind, commit unwholesome actions, they will in the future inevitably follow their karma and undergo the results of suffering in woeful states; when they, by body, speech, and mind, perform wholesome actions, they will be reborn in heavenly realms and other happy destinations. In this way, he can truly see the whole causal pattern of heavenly realms and states of woe. He not only understands karma and its results in principle, but in lived reality he directly sees the manifestation of karmic fruits. The wisdom and penetration thus accomplished is one of the criteria for the true inner virtues of a noble one.

IV. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power, Supernormal Might, and the Ability to Remain in the World

IV.1 The Supernormal Transformations Accomplished through Cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power  
When a practitioner cultivates the four bases of spiritual power, and cultivates them abundantly, he can, in accordance with his wishes, obtain various supernormal attainments and experience many and diverse supernormal transformations. He can transform one body into many bodies and many bodies back into one body, appear or hide, manifest or vanish his form as he wishes; he can pass through walls and penetrate barriers, cross over cliffs and mountains unobstructedly, as if moving through the sky; he can appear and disappear within the great earth, as a person goes in and out of water; he can walk upon water without sinking, as if walking on solid ground; in midair he can sit cross-legged, or fly like a bird, completely free in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. Going further, when such a person is endowed with great supernormal power and great majestic might, he can even touch the sun and moon with his hand, reach out and touch the sun, moon, and stars, and by the power of his body reach the Brahmā world, so that his supernormal attainments extend upward even to the Brahmā realm. Many teachings point out that, after cultivating and repeatedly cultivating the four bases of spiritual power, one can accomplish such a wide range of supernormal transformations: transforming one body into many bodies, and by the power of one’s body reaching the Brahmā world. All these are vast virtues brought about by the four bases of spiritual power.

IV.2 The Meaning of Supernormal Might and Spiritual Power  
“Supernormal might” refers to the realm in which a practitioner can experience and manifest many kinds of supernormal transformations. Its concrete expressions include transforming a single body into many bodies, or gathering many bodies into one, and also extending his own majestic supernormal influence even to the Brahmā world, so that his bodily power reaches the Brahmā realm. “Spiritual power” (the bases of spiritual power) is the fundamental basis and path through which such supernormal might is obtained. It is a trajectory that must be followed, an indispensable path of cultivation for attaining supernormal might and various supernormal powers. In other words, without cultivating the bases of spiritual power, one cannot truly and fully obtain supernormal might; but once the bases of spiritual power are accomplished, the various supernormal transformations that unfold from them naturally appear, becoming clear marks of the fruits of practice.

IV.3 Supernormal Majesty and Bodily Power Reaching the Brahmā Realm  
As cultivation of the four bases of spiritual power becomes complete, the practitioner can experience many kinds of supernormal transformations: transforming one body into many, gathering many into one, and extending his own power to the Brahmā realm. His supernormal attainments are not confined to the human realm or the sensual realm, but can be elevated upward, reaching the Brahmā world, so that his majesty and bodily power pervade vast world-systems. Many passages emphasize that, when the four bases of spiritual power have been attained and repeatedly cultivated, the resulting supernormal majesty is this extensive: not only does one possess bodily transformations, but by this bodily power can reach the Brahmā world, showing that the practitioner has surpassed the limitations of an ordinary body and mind and entered a realm of practice in which supernormal transformation is a matter of course.

IV.4 The Tathāgata’s Ability to Remain in the World and an Aeon plus More  
For a Tathāgata whose cultivation is complete, the accomplishment of the four bases of spiritual power is also manifested in his ability to remain in the world. If the Tathāgata so wishes, he can, by relying on this ability, remain in the world for an aeon, or even for an aeon and more. This means that the Tathāgata has the ability to prolong the duration of his own stay in the world; he does not remain passively in accordance with karma, nor is he powerless regarding the length of his life, but can, by the concentration and bases of spiritual power he has realized, cause his lifespan to continue according to his intention. The display of such an ability to remain is likewise one of the distinguished fruits and virtues after the four bases of spiritual power have been fully cultivated.

V. Concrete Manifestations of Supernormal Transformations

V.1 Bodily Transformations and Freedom in Appearing and Vanishing  
Within the accomplishment of supernormal powers and supernormal transformations, bodily transformation is an especially striking aspect. A practitioner can transform a single bodily form into many bodily forms, and then gather the many bodies back into one. He can not only change the number of bodies, but also freely choose whether to make his body appear or disappear: if he wishes to appear, he manifests; if he wishes to vanish, he is unseen by others, attaining complete freedom in appearing and vanishing. In some situations, he can even manifest only half his body while teaching the Dhamma, or not appear in person at all and teach solely by voice. Such freedom in using the body—appearing or not appearing, fully or half present—is the outcome of the knowledge of supernormal transformation and the accomplishment of the four bases of spiritual power.

V.2 Passing Through Without Obstruction, Mastery of Earth and Water, and Flight in the Air  
For a practitioner endowed with supernormal powers, the limitations of the material world are no longer passively accepted. He can pass through walls, mountains, and all kinds of obstacles as though walking through air; for him, walls and cliffs are no longer barriers, but are like empty space without obstruction. He can also emerge and vanish within the earth freely, like entering and leaving water without difficulty; he can walk on the surface of water without sinking, just like walking on firm ground; at the same time, he can sit cross-legged in midair or fly in the sky like a bird, moving at ease. These practices are the concrete manifestations of “mastery over earth and water” and “flight in the air,” showing that he has transcended the ordinary person’s bondage to the four great elements and to gravity.

V.3 Touching the Sun and Moon, Reaching the Brahmā Realm, and Rising into the Air  
On an even grander scale, one accomplished in supernormal powers can touch the sun, moon, and stars with his hand, regarding what is ordinarily unimaginably distant as something close at hand, which he can reach out and touch. The majestic power of his body can also extend to the Brahmā world, so that he can travel freely to the Brahmā realm with this very body, or reach the Brahmā world by the power of his body. Even before displaying such transformations, his body need not make any obvious effort or movement; he can rise up from the ground into the air, as if freed from the bonds of gravity. On that basis he can then further experience many kinds of supernormal transformations: transforming one bodily form into many, and by the might of his body touching the Brahmā world. These abilities, repeatedly mentioned, all serve to illustrate that, when supernormal might and the bases of spiritual power are accomplished, a practitioner’s movement between heaven and earth is no longer obstructed by ordinary physical conditions, but is characterized by a transcendent freedom of coming and going.

VI. The Four Establishments of Mindfulness, Great Comprehensive Knowledge, and Transcendence of the World

VI.1 The Four Establishments of Mindfulness, Great Comprehensive Knowledge, and Surpassing a Thousand World-Systems  
Cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness is not merely the foundation for developing mindfulness and contemplation of body and mind; it also has extremely sublime virtues. If one cultivates the four establishments of mindfulness, one can obtain great comprehensive knowledge; if one repeatedly cultivates the four establishments of mindfulness, ploughing this field of contemplation over and over, one can all the more strongly obtain great comprehensive knowledge. This great comprehensive knowledge not only endows the practitioner with vast penetration in understanding and discerning phenomena, but also allows him, in power and wisdom, to surpass vast world-systems. The texts point out that, by cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness, one can surpass a thousand world-systems; if one repeatedly cultivates the four establishments of mindfulness, one still surpasses a thousand world-systems. This statement that one “surpasses a thousand world-systems” shows that the practice of the four establishments of mindfulness is not merely a matter of calming and disciplining one’s own body and mind; it is the key by which one’s capacities and wisdom can tower above and transcend the many domains of a thousand world-systems.

VI.2 The Four Establishments of Mindfulness, Supernormal Powers, Knowledge of Past Lives, and Extraordinary Perception  
When the practice of the four establishments of mindfulness is mature, a practitioner can obtain various supernormal transformations. He can not only remember events that occurred a thousand eons ago, clearly recalling the many conditions in the remote past, but can also transform one body into many, and even extend the power of his body to the Brahmā world. This corresponds to the supernormal transformations brought about by the four bases of spiritual power mentioned earlier, showing that, on the basis of wisdom, the four establishments of mindfulness also yield extraordinary results.

Furthermore, with a purified divine-ear faculty, he can hear the voices of gods in distant and nearby regions alike; whether close at hand or far beyond many world-systems, he can clearly distinguish them. By using the knowledge of others’ minds, he can know the mental states of other sentient beings, discerning whether they possess greed, whether their minds have become liberated, and so forth—corresponding to what was previously said about the differences between minds with greed, hatred, and delusion, with concentration or without it, with liberation or without liberation. With a purified divine eye, he can further know how all sentient beings undergo the results of their respective karma, clearly seeing the sufferings and pleasures, inferiority and superiority, beauty and ugliness, and happy and woeful destinies they experience in various worlds, thereby gaining an even deeper realization of the law of karma and its results.

At the same time, he can recollect many kinds of past-life destinies, not only recalling the modes of conduct and names he had in one or two lifetimes and many lifetimes, but, in line with what was said earlier about the knowledge of past lives, can know in detail the names, clans, bodily color, food, pleasures and pains, the lengths of lives, and so on in each life, as well as the places of birth and death, the places where he vanished and was reborn, the forms he took and the places he dwelt, remembering them one by one. This deep recollection of past lives, combined with the mindful contemplation cultivated by the four establishments of mindfulness, enables him to have a thorough and undistorted understanding of where he has come from and where he is going.

VI.3 Discerning Wisdom, Understanding a Thousand Worlds, and Liberation through the Exhaustion of Taints  
On the basis of the wisdom attained through the four establishments of mindfulness and other practices, a noble one can also give rise to a vast discerning capacity. He can truly know what is a right course and what is a wrong course, clearly distinguishing under what circumstances things and actions are appropriate and reasonable, and under what circumstances they are mistaken and deviate from the true path. He can truly know the differing karmic results—past, present, and future—how and where these results will ripen, and for what causes and conditions they ripen. He can grasp the path that universally leads to liberation, and observe the structures of the many realms and the various world-systems, understanding the diversity and the hierarchical differences among all worlds.

He can also know the various convictions held by beings, discerning where their understanding of phenomena leans and where their attachments lie. He can judge the sharpness or dullness of sentient beings’ faculties, seeing who is of sharp faculties and who of dull, who can be easily instructed and who still needs gradual guidance. Moreover, he can accurately observe all the states of meditative absorption, liberations, concentrations, and attainments, distinguishing their defiled and their purified aspects, and the kinds of emancipation obtained thereby, knowing, among the states of concentration and liberation, which still carry subtle defilement and which are already free of defilement and have reached purity.

When all this wisdom and all these supernormal powers are complete, the practitioner can realize for himself the exhaustion of the taints, completely cutting off all defilements and outflows, attaining taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and abiding in this here and now, without having to wait for a future life for full realization. At this time, the great supernormal powers he has obtained not only enable him to understand the many situations of a thousand worlds and to see the arising and ceasing and the causal patterns within a thousand world-systems, but also to let his voice be heard so that beings in a thousand world-systems receive the Dhamma. This “understanding a thousand worlds” is not merely a matter of having extensive knowledge; rather, by realizing great comprehensive knowledge he actually penetrates the nature of phenomena in a thousand world-systems, and within them contemplates and teaches with purified wisdom.

VII. The Overall Accomplishment of Fully Completed Practice

VII.1 Accomplishment of Great Supernormal Powers and Understanding a Thousand Worlds  
When a practitioner has fully completed the four establishments of mindfulness, the four bases of spiritual power, the six kinds of supernormal knowledge, and many other practices, he “obtains great supernormal powers.” This accomplishment of great supernormal powers is repeatedly used to describe the fruits of fully completed practice. He can not only accomplish many kinds of supernormal transformations with his body, using various supernormal powers to their utmost, but can also extend the reach of his supernormal attainments to the Brahmā world, so that his movements are no longer confined by the boundaries of the human world. On this basis, his understanding of a thousand worlds also unfolds; one can say that he “understands a thousand worlds,” penetrating the conditions and laws in a thousand world-systems, and thereby even more completely carrying out the work of liberating beings.

VII.2 Taintless Liberation in the Here-and-Now and Direct Self-Realization  
After supernormal powers and wisdom are complete, the most crucial point remains the thorough ending of all taints. When a practitioner, by the wisdom he has realized, cuts off all defilements and latent tendencies, he attains taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and in this very life abides in this liberated state. This liberation is not some vague self-consolation, but is “abiding in the here-and-now, directly knowing and realizing for oneself”: he knows with perfect clarity, right now, that he has realized liberation, that he has completed the unsurpassed holy life, and does not need others’ judgments or external confirmation. The realm he has reached has never been reached by anyone before, and it is the ultimate accomplishment that the scriptures repeatedly emphasize.

VII.3 The Integrated Characteristics of a Virtuous Noble One Who Has Transcended the World  
In sum, a virtuous noble one will inevitably possess complete supernormal powers, thorough wisdom, and perfect liberation at the same time. With a purified divine eye and divine ear he can, without moving, perceive and converse at a distance, observing the sights and sounds of the many realms of humans and gods, with an ability equal in purity to that of the Blessed One. By the knowledge of past lives, he knows the many courses of himself and beings throughout past lives and eons, even through eons of evolution, dissolution, and evolution-and-dissolution. By the knowledge of others’ minds, he knows the arising and ceasing of beings’ greed, hatred, and delusion, and whether or not they possess concentration and liberation. By the knowledge of supernormal transformation and the four bases of spiritual power, he displays many supernormal transformations such as making one body many, passing through walls, flying in the air, and even extending the might of his body to the Brahmā realm. By the knowledge of the divine eye and divine ear, he understands how beings receive the results of their karma and from where all sounds arise. With great comprehensive knowledge, he discerns right and wrong courses, the ripening of various karmas, the universal path, the many worlds and all world-systems, and the defiled and purified aspects of all meditative absorptions and liberations.

When all these virtues are complete, he is no longer merely someone who possesses supernormal powers, but is a true noble one and a worthy recipient of offerings. Such a noble one, with his own complete wisdom and immeasurable supernormal powers, transcends a thousand world-systems and a thousand worlds, directly realizing for himself in the here-and-now, and presents to all beings the complete path from ordinary person to liberation, from the limited to the limitless.
