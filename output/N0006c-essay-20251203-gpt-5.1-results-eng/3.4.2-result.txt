<title> The Meaning of the Five Faculties, Their Principles of Cultivation, and the Achievement of Liberation </title>
<article>
I. General Explanation of the Five Faculties and Their Fundamental Meaning  
The Five Faculties are an important foundation leading to awakening. They are the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. These five mental powers, taken together, are called the Five Faculties. They are indispensable fundamental principles for practitioners on the path of liberation. Among them, the faculty of wisdom is the most excellent. It is likened to the lion, king of beasts; to the footprint of the elephant, foremost among all footprints; and to red sandalwood, supreme among fragrances. It is the key core for accomplishing bodhi and attaining awakening.

II. Criteria for Determining a True Śramaṇa and a True Brāhmaṇa  
II.1 Using Clear Understanding of the Arising and Ceasing of the Five Faculties as the Criterion  
The crucial measure of whether a śramaṇa or a brāhmaṇa is genuine lies in whether he can directly and truly know the complete meaning of the Five Faculties. If a śramaṇa or a brāhmaṇa can truly know the arising and cessation of the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom, can discern the ambrosial flavor they contain, the faults hidden within them, and also know the way and the state by which one departs from these faults, then such a person may be called a true śramaṇa, a true brāhmaṇa. Such a person can, in this very life, personally realize and directly verify, and dwell fully established in the state thus attained. If one cannot truly know the arising, cessation, flavor, faults, and escape with regard to the Five Faculties, then one cannot be established as a genuine śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa, nor can one in this very life personally verify what one proclaims.

II.2 Using Discriminative Understanding of Each Individual Faculty as the Criterion  
In addition, the criterion can also be observed from the perspective of each individual faculty. If a śramaṇa or a brāhmaṇa can distinctly and correctly know the very nature of the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, and can truly know the arising and cessation of each faculty and the path that leads to its cessation and to quiescence, then he likewise may be called a true śramaṇa, a true brāhmaṇa. One who reaches this level can also, in this very life, personally know, realize in the present, and dwell fully established. If one cannot thus understand the Five Faculties, their arising and cessation, and the path that accords with their cessation, then one does not possess the qualifications of a true śramaṇa or brāhmaṇa.

III. Principles for Cultivating the Five Faculties and the Stages of Realization  
III.1 The Basic Direction of Cultivation  
In actual practice, the Five Faculties must be cultivated according to correct principles. When cultivating the Five Faculties, one should direct the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom so that they are in harmony with stillness and in harmony with complete awakening. In other words, the direction of cultivating these five faculties should be toward the quiescent calming of the mind and toward the final state of perfect enlightenment.

The degree to which a practitioner has cultivated the Five Faculties directly affects his position and attainment on the path of liberation. The fullness and perfection of the Five Faculties determine the level of liberation that the practitioner can reach: the more complete the Five Faculties, the deeper and more thorough the liberation; if the Five Faculties are not yet complete, the level of liberation is accordingly limited.

III.2 The Fruits of Cultivating the Five Faculties  
When a person can cultivate, and repeatedly cultivate, these Five Faculties so that the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom continually increase and become firm, this will lead to the complete cessation of all taints. Because the taints are extinguished, the practitioner can accomplish the liberation of mind and the liberation by wisdom that are free of taints, personally knowing and realizing this in the present life, and dwelling fully established in this liberated state.

At the same time, through cultivating and fully developing the Five Faculties, the practitioner can in actuality become a liberated one whose defilements have been completely extinguished. One who attains such a state can personally realize and confirm: the round of rebirth has ended, the pure practice has been established, what should be done has been fully done; from now on there will be no further continuation of the flow of birth and death. When the Five Faculties are thoroughly cultivated and fully developed, they can bring about the ultimate result of liberation through the cessation of the taints, making the attainment of liberation perfectly complete, with nothing lacking.

IV. The Law Governing the Five Faculties and Differences in Practice  
IV.1 The Fundamental Law  
Among the Five Faculties, there is a fundamental law: because of differences in the faculties of individuals, there arise differences in results and attainments; and because of differences in results, there further arise differences among people. That is to say, the varying strength, maturity, and completeness of different practitioners in the five faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom directly bring about higher or lower degrees of liberative attainment, and these differences in attainment in turn constitute differences in level and status among practitioners.

From the standpoint of conduct, if someone can practice the Five Faculties in a complete way, he can accomplish a complete result. If he practices only partially or develops them one‑sidedly, he will obtain only partial attainment. This shows that the effect of the Five Faculties is never in vain: whether practiced fully or partially, they are never wasted; the results brought about by their cultivation will unfailingly manifest as they are. For this reason, the Five Faculties are “not squandered.”

IV.2 The Stages of Realization Established in Dependence on the Faculties  
The sequence and levels in the process of realization are closely related to the degree of completeness of the Five Faculties. The level of liberation that a practitioner can realize is established precisely on whether or not the Five Faculties are mature and complete. The more abundant and perfect the Five Faculties are, the further the practitioner can advance along the noble path, and the more thorough his liberation will be. Conversely, if the Five Faculties are weak or unbalanced, then the level of realization attained will be confined accordingly. Thus the state of cultivation of the Five Faculties actually forms the fundamental basis for the stages of realization and the higher or lower levels thereof.

V. Key Conditions for the Attainment of Liberation  
For the cultivation of the Five Faculties to truly lead to liberation, certain key conditions must be fulfilled. If a person neither knows nor sees the true content of the Dharma, cannot experience it, and cannot realize it here and now, if his mind has no contact with wisdom, and he merely cultivates the Five Faculties based solely on faith in others, then such cultivation of the Five Faculties cannot bring about genuine liberation. In other words, if practice remains only at the level of relying on trust in what others teach, while lacking one’s own knowing, seeing, and direct realization of the Dharma, then although the Five Faculties are being developed, they will scarcely become causes and conditions for complete liberation.

By contrast, if the practitioner can genuinely know, see, experience, and realize the Dharma here and now, so that his mind actually makes contact with wisdom and is no longer hesitant or doubtful regarding the Dharma, then the Five Faculties cultivated on this basis will certainly be able to accomplish liberation. When knowing, seeing, understanding, and direct realization are all present, the arousing of wisdom makes the mind firm and irreversible. On this foundation, the cultivation of the five faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom will inevitably lead to the final fruit of complete liberation.

VI. The Status of the Five Faculties in Awakening and the Arising of Noble Wisdom  
VI.1 The Five Faculties as Fundamental Principles of Awakening  
Taken as a whole, the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom are fundamental principles that lead to awakening. They are not merely supportive conditions for practice but are the core foundation for the accomplishment of awakening. Among these Five Faculties, the faculty of wisdom is especially excellent. It is like the lion, king of beasts, most honored among all animals; like the elephant’s footprint, the largest among all footprints; and like red sandalwood, the finest among all fragrances. The faculty of wisdom has this kind of encompassing and surpassing quality. It is the most crucial factor among the Five Faculties for the accomplishment of bodhi and the attainment of awakening.

VI.2 The Relationship Between Noble Wisdom and the Equal Establishment of the Other Four Faculties  
Before noble wisdom has arisen, the four faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, and concentration cannot reach a truly equal and balanced establishment. That is to say, when the mind has not yet developed the wisdom of a noble one, even if there is faith, energy, mindfulness, and concentration, these four still lack firm integration and are unable to abide in a balanced and equal state.

Once noble wisdom arises, the situation becomes entirely different. With the appearance of the wisdom of a noble one, the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, and concentration can truly become equally and steadily established. They no longer incline toward imbalance but can function in harmonious coordination under the guidance of wisdom. A noble disciple endowed with wisdom relies precisely on such wisdom to guide his faith, energy, mindfulness, and concentration, enabling these four faculties to abide in equal and stable balance. In the complete functioning of all Five Faculties, he thereby continually deepens the attainment of liberation and awakening.
