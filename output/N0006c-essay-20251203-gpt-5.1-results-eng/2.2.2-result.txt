<article>
I. Abiding in the Present and Guarding the Mind

I.1 The State of Mind that Abides in the Present  
A practitioner must learn to let the mind abide in the present, no longer grieving over what has already passed, nor cherishing longings and fantasies about a future that has not yet come. When the mind no longer runs to the two extremes, but instead is steadily established in what is unfolding right now, body and mind will naturally become bright and joyful, attaining a state of clarity and ease.

I.2 Principles for Guarding the Mind  
In guarding the mind, one should be like a turtle that, when encountering danger, draws in its four limbs, carefully protecting itself and not letting them casually extend outward. This guarding is not a rigid repression, but a skillful collecting and holding of the intention, so that the mind does not cling to any object, nor harm others due to uncontrolled mental actions. When the mind is well protected and does not race after conditions, it can gradually distance itself from all kinds of defilements.

I.3 Free from Defilements and Beyond Reproach  
If a person can skillfully guard the mind so as to stay away from defilements such as greed, hatred, and delusion, then in behavior and attitude they will no longer create deeds that can be censured. When defilements do not arise and manifest, others have no grounds to disparage or ridicule them. Their bodily, verbal, and mental actions naturally become pure and worthy of praise.

II. Mindfulness and Wisdom: Overcoming Māra’s Obstructions and Interference

II.1 The Fundamental Antidote to Māra’s Obstructions  
What is called the obstruction of Māra and inner and outer interference has its fundamental antidote in maintaining right mindfulness and clear comprehension, so that the mind is no longer stained by sensual desire. A practitioner should strive, in every circumstance, to be free of greed and attachment, thoroughly abandoning the habit of clinging, while also seeing clearly and as it truly is that all phenomena are not-self, do not belong to a self, and that there is no “self” that can be grasped. When clinging to “I” is penetrated with insight and loosened, Māra’s obstruction finds no place to take hold.

II.2 The Application of Mindfulness and Wisdom  
When facing various interferences, one must first allow mindfulness to be continuously present, maintaining clear awareness of the states of body, speech, and mind. Next, one must apply wisdom to observe all situations and feelings encountered, carefully examining how these interferences arise and how they change. Through this wise observation, the practitioner can recognize the true nature of these disturbances and is no longer confused or led around by them.

II.3 Maintaining the Mind and the State of the Liberated One  
In actual practice, one must learn to keep consciousness pure and clear, so that the mind is like clear water—transparent and not disturbed by the changing ups and downs of the external environment. When external conditions are unstable and fluctuating, the practitioner still does not give rise to terror and fear, and does not panic because of circumstances. This is precisely the cultivation-state of one who is liberated: with right mindfulness they distance themselves from clinging, fully knowing that there is no need to seek or grasp any phenomenon, and thus they no longer chase after any realm. At the same time, they no longer recall and cling to anger of the past, nor approach practice with laziness, but instead depart from bondage at its very root.

III. The Practitioner’s Environment, Attitude, and Daily Conduct

III.1 Proper Attitude and Environment for Practice  
When a practitioner feels inner displeasure, restlessness, or lack of clarity, they should all the more carefully guard the six sense bases, not allowing eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind to become careless and lose themselves in forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and mental objects. If one can make good use of time in solitude, staying away from objects that cause fear and anxiety, the mind can gain stability and tranquility. As for Dharma teachings, one must verify them through actual practice and personal experience, rather than relying merely on hearsay, gossip, or other people’s words.

III.2 Regulating Body and Mind When Entering Lay Households  
When a monastic practitioner enters lay households or approaches lay people, they should go with body and mind disciplined, taming their conduct and inner state—neither careless nor arrogant. Regardless of how long they have been in the Saṅgha, they should always regard themselves with the humility of a newly-ordained monk, maintaining modesty and respect towards lay people, avoiding pride and affectation, so that body, speech, and mind all display discipline, gentleness, and dignity.

III.3 Basic Rules of Daily Practice  
In daily life, a practitioner must first guard the doors of the sense faculties, paying attention so that eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not drawn and stained by their objects. With regard to food, they must exercise moderation, not greedy for quantity nor seeking delicious flavors, taking the maintenance of bodily and mental balance as primary. Nighttime sitting meditation should be devout and focused, not idly passed through in laziness. At the same time, one must possess a sense of shame and remorse, being able to feel ashamed of unwholesome actions and mistakes and amend them, and should also listen earnestly to the true Dharma, delighting in studying its genuine meaning so that practice has a firm basis.

IV. Overcoming Sensual Desire and the Contemplation of the Body

IV.1 The Practice of Impurity Contemplation and Specific Methods  
To counteract sensual desire, a practitioner can cultivate the contemplation of impurity, thereby adjusting their own mind and weakening fascination with the physical body and sensual objects. In daily life they must also maintain mindfulness of the body, clearly observing its real condition in order to nurture disillusionment and revulsion toward body and mind. Furthermore, they should cultivate signless contemplation, which abandons forms, marks, and grasping, in order to completely remove latent arrogance. During practice, the mind should be focused on a single point, abiding in stillness and not scattering.

In contemplating the body, the practitioner can dwell in the perception “from the soles of the feet up to the top of the head and from the top of the head down to the soles of the feet,” observing the entire body as full of impurities, knowing that above is just like below, and below is just like above, with nothing worthy of desire. The composition of the body is observed, as it truly is, as: hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm (rib area), membranes, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, and excrement; and also bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, lymph (bodily fluids), saliva, nasal mucus, oil of the joints, and urine—many impure components. Through this step-by-step analysis and contemplation, sensual desire is naturally subdued.

IV.2 Mutual Collecting of Body and Mind and Focused Guarding  
In the relationship between body and mind, one should learn to collect the body into the mind, allowing bodily actions to be guided by mental intention, while also collecting the mind into the body so that it no longer disperses outward. When the mind keeps returning to observe the body, it is like holding a vessel filled to the brim with oil: one must be extremely careful, not daring to spill a single drop, maintaining continuous attention on oneself, without scattering toward external objects. One must remain highly alert toward the object of attention, not permitting even a moment of heedlessness.

In actual practice, one should continuously and extensively cultivate the contemplation of the body, treating bodily awareness as the foundation of the path, using it to establish and perfect all wholesome qualities. In this way, through repeated cultivation, the contemplation of the body becomes a solid base, so that the mind no longer wavers and overturns in accordance with body and external conditions.

V. The Benefits, Definition, and Here-and-Now Nature of Mindfulness

V.1 The Benefits and Characteristics of Mindfulness  
Mindfulness has the power to bring happiness and ease; at any time, the mere presence of mindfulness is itself auspicious. Because it can guard the mind, subdue defilements, and guide wisdom, a practitioner should maintain mindfulness constantly and not allow it to be lost. As long as mindfulness does not decline, the stability and clarity of body and mind will continue to grow.

V.2 The Here-and-Now Dhamma and Knowing Stained and Unstained Mind  
The so-called “here-and-now Dhamma” refers to phenomena that can be directly experienced in the present, immediately visible, and that can guide the practitioner step by step toward Nibbāna. The wise should personally understand, one by one, these immediately verifiable phenomena, rather than relying only on words and inference. When one can recognize, as it arises, whether one’s mind is defiled or purified—whether it is a stained mind or an unstained mind—this is the practice of the here-and-now Dhamma. This knowing is immediate and directly visible in the present; through such instant discrimination, the wise personally understand how the Dhamma operates within their own experience.

V.3 The Definition and Practice of Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension  
When knowing various feelings, the mind must first be in a stable state and endowed with both clear comprehension and mindfulness. Only thus can one understand the nature of feeling itself, see clearly how feelings arise, how they endure, and how they cease, and further realize the methods that bring about their cessation.

The way to practice mindfulness is to dwell in contemplation within four domains—body, feelings, mind, and mental phenomena—carrying an attitude of ardent effort, maintaining clear comprehension and bare mindfulness, in order to restrain worldly sensual desire and sorrow. Concretely, this is: contemplating the body in the body and dwelling therein; contemplating feelings in feelings and dwelling therein; contemplating mind in mind and dwelling therein; contemplating phenomena in phenomena and dwelling therein. Clear comprehension means keeping lucid awareness within all bodily actions and daily activities—whether going forward or back, bending or stretching, walking, standing, sitting, lying down—clearly knowing what one is doing. Likewise, while looking and gazing around, putting on clothing and using requisites, eating and tasting, defecating and urinating, sleeping and waking, speaking and remaining silent, one is able to know clearly, as it is, one’s present actions and states of mind.

VI. The System of Practice and the Thirty-Seven Aids to Awakening

VI.1 Signless Concentration and Its Foundation in the Foundations of Mindfulness  
Within the core methods of practice, signless concentration requires certain basic conditions. First, one must completely extinguish three unwholesome mental states—thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of ill-will, and thoughts of harm—so that these three no longer dominate the mind. Then the practitioner should dwell in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, cultivating awareness of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena as the support for signless concentration, thereby stabilizing the mind’s focus and its quality of not taking up signs and not grasping.

VI.2 The Complete Practice of the Thirty-Seven Aids to Awakening  
Within the system of practice, the Thirty-Seven Aids to Awakening form a highly complete framework. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are the contemplation and dwelling in body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, so that the mind does not stray from these four areas of awareness. The Four Right Strivings are: to prevent unarisen unwholesome states from arising; to abandon unwholesome states that have arisen; to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen; and to maintain and increase wholesome states that have already arisen. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power are the cultivation of concentration based on desire, energy, mind, and investigation: by directing desire toward the wholesome, persisting with unremitting effort, maintaining mental focus, and having correct reflection, these four kinds of concentration are completed through diligent practice.  

The Five Spiritual Faculties and Five Powers are: the faculty of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, and the corresponding powers of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. The former are basic capacities; the latter are stronger, unshakable strengths. The Seven Factors of Awakening are: mindfulness, investigation of dhammas, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity—progressively from awareness, discrimination, effort, joy, physical and mental lightness, mental unification, to impartial letting go. Finally, the Noble Eightfold Path includes right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration, forming the complete right path that leads to liberation.

VI.3 The Relationship Between the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and the Seven Factors of Awakening  
In the sequence of the system of practice, by cultivating and cultivating repeatedly the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, one can bring the Seven Factors of Awakening to fulfillment. When a practitioner continually dwells in contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, using ardor, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to subdue worldly sensual desire and sorrow, the Seven Factors of Awakening gradually arise and mature. Thus it can be understood that the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are not only one part of the Thirty-Seven Aids to Awakening, but also the fundamental supporting conditions that give rise to the other awakening factors and path factors.

VII. The Overall Definition and Universal Applicability of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness

VII.1 The Four Foundations of Mindfulness as the Gathering of Wholesome Qualities and the One Vehicle Path  
What is called the gathering of wholesome qualities refers precisely to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. They are composed of the contemplation of the body, contemplation of feelings, contemplation of mind, and contemplation of phenomena; a practitioner should contemplate the body in the body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, and phenomena in phenomena. In the process of contemplation, one must maintain ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, and with these subdue worldly greed and distress. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are also the One Vehicle Path: their scope of practice encompasses the four domains of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena. By contemplating body, feelings, mind, and phenomena in these four domains and dwelling in accordance with the common principles, one can move toward liberation.

VII.2 The Significance of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness for Practitioners at All Stages  
The method of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is applicable to monks at every stage of practice, whether they are newly ordained trainees, learners who still have work to do, or noble ones who have attained fruition. Newly ordained practitioners should be encouraged to cultivate the Four Foundations of Mindfulness diligently so that they can see the true nature of body, mind, and phenomena as they really are. Learners who still have cultivation to complete aspire to the highest peace and security, relying on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness with the goal of fully understanding bodily and mental phenomena, not overlooking even the subtlest changes. Those who have realized the fruits of the path, though already liberated, should still continue to cultivate the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, distancing themselves even more from all subtle fetters.

In the concrete rules of practice, practitioners dwell contemplating body in the body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, and phenomena in phenomena. Through this, they accomplish direct knowing and full knowing, and gradually depart from all kinds of bonds.

VII.3 The Four Foundations of Mindfulness as a Safe Domain and One’s Own Place  
On the path of practice, there are two different domains. One is the domain in which heedlessness and the five strands of sensual pleasure easily arise—this is the non-practicing territory. The other is the safe domain in which one should abide. This safe domain is called one’s own place, the parents’ domain, and it refers precisely to the cultivation of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. When a practitioner leaves the non-practicing territory—that is, leaves behind the pleasures of the five desirable sense-objects—and abides in their own place, devoting themselves to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, Māra has no opportunity or condition to invade.

Therefore, a practitioner should contemplate in regard to body, feelings, mind, and phenomena: contemplating the body in the body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, and phenomena in phenomena, maintaining ardor, correct understanding, and focused mindfulness to subdue sensual desire and distress toward the world. The combination of distancing oneself from non-practicing territory, abiding in one’s own place, and cultivating the Four Foundations of Mindfulness enables one to avoid Māra’s disturbance and gradually attain liberation.

VIII. Principles and Concrete Content of the Contemplation in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness

VIII.1 Objects of Contemplation and a Unified Attitude  
In the methods of cultivating the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the basic principle is to contemplate the object within that object itself—that is, to contemplate the body in the body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, and phenomena in phenomena. No matter which object is being observed, one must maintain ardor, correct understanding, and right recollection, so that the mind is neither scattered nor dull. The fundamental purpose of practice is, through continuous contemplation, to subdue sensual desire and sorrow toward the world, and to abide in the contemplation itself.  

To carry out this principle, the practitioner must remain ardent and focused, sustaining correct awareness and moment-by-moment clarity. This same attitude applies equally to all four objects of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness: body, feelings, mind, and phenomena.

VIII.2 The Framework of Internal, External, and Both Internal and External Contemplation  
In the actual cultivation of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, a practitioner should not only contemplate the body in the body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, and phenomena in phenomena, but should also contemplate on three levels: internal, external, and both internal and external. For example, in the contemplation of the body, one should contemplate the internal body, the external body, and both internal and external bodies; in the contemplation of feelings, internal feelings, external feelings, and both internal and external feelings; in the contemplation of mind, internal mental states, external mental phenomena, and both internal and external minds; in the contemplation of phenomena, internal principles (dhammas), external principles, and both internal and external principles.

Furthermore, a practitioner should contemplate, within these three categories of internal, external, and both internal and external objects of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, their arising (origination), their cessation, and the path leading to both arising and cessation—that is, observing how defilements and suffering arise, how they cease, and the interrelated principle between arising and ceasing. Throughout this process, one should likewise support the contemplation with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, so that sensual desire and sorrow toward the world are subdued.

VIII.3 The Four Foundations of Mindfulness in Daily Clear Comprehension and Dealing with Situations  
In the practice of clear comprehension, a practitioner should maintain lucid awareness in all bodily movements and daily activities, not only during formal sitting meditation, but also when going forward and back, bending and stretching, walking, standing, sitting, and lying down; as well as when looking and gazing around, putting on clothing, using utensils, eating and tasting, defecating and urinating, sleeping and waking, speaking and keeping silent. When the contemplations of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness permeate everyday actions, mindfulness and clear comprehension can truly be brought to completion.

When facing various situations, a practitioner must also skillfully use reflective attitudes. If one is in a situation that is agreeable, yet wishes to relate to it with a notion of disagreeableness, then one can establish a perception of “disagreeable” with regard to what is actually agreeable, thereby weakening attachment. Conversely, when in a disagreeable situation but wishing not to give rise to aversion and rejection, one can establish a perception of “not-disagreeable” in relation to what is actually disagreeable. When confronted with both agreeable and disagreeable conditions at the same time, if one wishes to dwell with a perception of disagreeableness, then one establishes a perception of disagreeableness toward both; if one wishes to dwell with a perception of non-disagreeableness, one establishes a perception of non-disagreeableness toward both. Going further, when one is willing to abandon the duality of agreeable and disagreeable, one can dwell with a mind of equanimity, mindfulness, and clear comprehension, cutting off both extremes and meeting all situations with even-minded letting go and lucid awareness.

IX. The Benefits of Practicing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and Liberation

IX.1 The Four Foundations of Mindfulness as Leading to Nibbāna and the Cessation of Suffering  
By cultivating and frequently practicing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, this noble path can lead practitioners out of defilements and properly reach the complete cessation of suffering. The content of practice in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is to maintain ardent effort, clear comprehension, and mindfulness in the four domains of contemplation, in order to overcome sensual desire and sorrow toward the world. On the level of the body, one contemplates the body within the body; on the level of mind, one contemplates mind within mind; on the level of phenomena, one contemplates mental phenomena within mental phenomena. When a practitioner contemplates body, feelings, mind, and phenomena with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, the inclination of body and mind gradually turns toward Nibbāna, leans toward Nibbāna, and draws near to Nibbāna.

One should also understand that Nibbāna can be realized through many methods of practice; all of these are effective paths. Among them, mindfulness directed to the body, combined with tranquility (samatha) and insight (vipassanā), is one of the basic methods. Through mindfulness directed to the body, together with the calm of tranquility and the penetrating seeing of insight, the path to Nibbāna gradually opens up.

IX.2 The Four Foundations of Mindfulness as Antidote to the Higher Fetters and the Five Hindrances  
On a higher level, in order to know the five higher fetters, fully understand them, thoroughly exhaust them, and ultimately cut them off, one should cultivate the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. Likewise, the general pattern followed by those who attain perfect enlightenment (Sammāsambuddha) includes: cutting off the secondary defilements and the five hindrances that obscure the mind, focusing the mind on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, further cultivating the Seven Factors of Awakening, and finally attaining unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.

The Four Foundations of Mindfulness can also serve as the core basis of many teachings. For example, beginning from the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, one can broadly explain the teaching on non-heedlessness, describing how to stay far from laziness and slackness; from them one can expound in detail the teachings on “what is done by strength,” clarifying how the powers of agent and act operate; again from them, one can explain the teachings on seeking, which expound the quest and search for truth; and from them one can elaborate the teachings on the “flood,” revealing how not to be swept away by defilements like a torrent. Thus the applications of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are very extensive.

IX.3 The Four Foundations of Mindfulness, Liberation of Mind, and Unbound Mindfulness  
Within the cultivation of mind, there is a key practice known as unbound mindfulness (mind no longer tied). When the mind is no longer bound to external objects, the practitioner can clearly know this unbound state, knowing that the mind no longer grasps either ahead or behind, no longer seizing past or future, but abides in liberation. Even so, one must still maintain contemplation within the Four Foundations of Mindfulness—that is, contemplating body in the body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, and phenomena in phenomena—dwelling with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness in the happiness of purity.

Regarding the methods and states of liberation of mind, a practitioner contemplates body, feelings, mind, and phenomena—body in body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, phenomena in phenomena—dwelling with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, subduing sensual desire and sorrow toward the world. When they dwell contemplating phenomena in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the mind no longer has any grasping toward the contemplated object. Precisely because the mind no longer grasps, it can be free from all defilements, gaining true liberation.

X. Mindfulness as Guardian, Gatekeeper, and the Faculty of Mindfulness

X.1 Mindfulness as Gatekeeper and the Simile for Mindfulness of the Body  
Mindfulness is likened to a wise and capable gatekeeper who blocks those who do not know, not allowing them to pass freely, while permitting the wise who do know to go through. This illustrates that mindfulness has the function of screening and guarding, allowing wholesome states to enter while stopping unwholesome states at the gate.

In the contemplation of the body, a strong and stable stake or pillar is used as a simile for the cultivation of mindfulness of the body. Just as a firm pillar can stabilize an entire structure, mindfulness of the body is the basis for guarding the six sense faculties. A practitioner should increase and restore mindfulness of the body, cherishing and accumulating it as if it were a precious mount or valuable vessel, diligently cultivating it so that the contemplation of the body becomes an unshakable support.

X.2 The Faculty of Mindfulness and Its Relationship to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness  
Among the Five Spiritual Faculties, the faculty of mindfulness is closely related to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. Because a noble disciple possesses mindfulness, they accomplish the supreme wisdom of remembering, and thus can recall and bring to mind deeds done and words spoken long ago without forgetting. The cultivation of this faculty of mindfulness cannot be separated from the practice within the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, that is, contemplating body in the body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, and phenomena in phenomena, dwelling with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, subduing sensual desire and sorrow toward the world.

In the overall definition of the Five Faculties, the faculty of mindfulness is obtained based on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness; in other words, it is precisely through cultivating the Four Foundations of Mindfulness that the faculty of mindfulness can arise and strengthen. Likewise, within the concrete contemplative bases of the Five Faculties, it is clearly stated that the faculty of mindfulness should be cultivated in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, allowing memory and awareness to work together and become an important pillar of the path.

X.3 Tying the Mind Well and the Swift Restoration of Mindfulness  
When a practitioner skillfully ties the mind to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and abides there, they can know the rise and fall of preceding and succeeding mental states, understanding the mind’s highs and lows at different stages. At that time, mindfulness continuously remains present, allowing the practitioner to dwell with unbounded thought—not scattered fantasy, but direct knowing of the states of liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, and to completely extinguish those unwholesome states that have already arisen.

Even if, in the course of practice, one occasionally loses mindfulness for a moment and unwholesome thoughts arise, if a solid foundation of mindfulness has previously been established, one can still quickly abandon, dispel, shatter, and destroy those thoughts so that they return to non-existence. This shows that mindfulness not only prevents unwholesome states from arising, but also has the power to swiftly restore and purify the mind.

XI. The Overall Summary of the Practice of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and Non-Heedlessness

XI.1 The Overall Practice Guidelines for Learner and Non-Learner Monks  
For learner monks (those who still have work to do), they should abide endowed with the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and take this as the overall guideline of their practice. The aim of cultivation is to subdue sensual desire and sorrow toward the world, attaining purity and stability of body and mind. This attitude in practice likewise applies to monks who have reached the stage of non-learner; they too should dwell with the Four Foundations of Mindfulness fully accomplished. Whether learner or non-learner, monks must in all contemplated objects employ ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness to subdue sensual desire and sorrow toward the world.

Moreover, even in order to accomplish great supernormal powers, one cannot leave behind this core practice of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. Practitioners must still contemplate body in the body, feelings in feelings, mind in mind, and phenomena in phenomena, taking the Four Foundations of Mindfulness as the basis; only then is it possible to further develop extraordinary supernormal abilities.

XI.2 Non-Heedlessness and Guarding Body, Speech, and Mind  
Regarding the effectiveness of guarding practice, one must first guard the three karmic doors of body, speech, and mind, so that actions, speech, and thoughts do not deviate from the right path, while establishing mindfulness so that the mind remains awake. A practitioner must also guard the sense faculties, not allowing eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind to roam freely, grasping at objects. If these guarding principles can be carried out, one will not be forced and driven by sensual desire; if they are not practiced, sensual desire will become strong and coercive, leaving the mind without freedom.

In the implementation of sensual renunciation, maintaining a non-heedless attitude in study and cultivation is extremely important. A practitioner must continually guard the awareness of mindfulness, directly observing the arising and ceasing of desire, clearly seeing that they are only processes that arise and cease due to conditions. In this way, the power of desire gradually weakens and no longer dominates the practitioner’s body and mind.

XI.3 The Combination of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and the Practice of Sensual Renunciation  
When a practitioner guards body, speech, and mind with a non-heedless attitude and at the same time dwells relying on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, they can ceaselessly subdue sensual desire and sorrow in daily life. In body, feelings, mind, and phenomena they are able to observe as things truly are, allowing mindfulness and clear comprehension to become the concrete tools of sensual renunciation. Over time, renunciation is no longer merely a concept, but through the continuous functioning of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness becomes an actual power of liberation grounded in the mind.

XII. Mindfulness of Breathing and the Fulfillment of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness

XII.1 The Stages of Mindfulness of Breathing and Their Connection to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness  
In the progressive training of mindfulness of breathing, each stage uses the basic pattern “learning to know the in-breath and the out-breath,” and at each stage clearly states whether the object of contemplation is body, feeling, mind, or phenomena and how they correspond. The process of cultivation begins with observation of the body, gradually deepens into feelings and mental states, and finally culminates in the contemplation of the very nature of phenomena.

In the stage of contemplating the body, the practitioner clearly knows long in-breaths and long out-breaths, short in-breaths and short out-breaths, and then becomes aware of the breath as it pervades the whole body, calming the bodily formations. Because in-breaths and out-breaths are part of the body, this stage belongs to contemplating body in the body. In the stage of contemplating the mind, the practitioner knows their own mind, gladdening the mind, unifying the mind, and setting it free, all the while breathing in and out. Because mindfulness of breathing cannot be separated from mindfulness and clear comprehension, this stage is precisely contemplating mind in the mind. In the stage of contemplating phenomena, the practitioner observes the impermanence of all phenomena and the abandoning of sensual desire, further contemplating cessation and letting go, using wisdom to observe and cut off sensual desire and distress; this is contemplating phenomena in phenomena. Through dwelling in continuous contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, the practitioner can trample upon and transcend all unwholesome and unskillful states, no longer being bound by them.

XII.2 The Fulfillment of Many Dharmas Through the Perfection of One  
In the general principle of perfection, it is stated that if one focuses on cultivating this single practice of mindfulness of breathing, one can bring the Four Foundations of Mindfulness to completion; when the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are complete, the Seven Factors of Awakening are likewise completed; and when the Seven Factors of Awakening are complete, then knowledge and liberation are brought to fulfillment.

Specifically, on the basis of mindfulness of breathing, four domains of awareness develop—that is, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. The cultivation and deepening of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness provide the condition for the arising of the Seven Factors of Awakening. When a practitioner contemplates each object within that object itself, dwelling with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, subduing sensual desire and sorrow toward the world, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are gradually perfected.

In the practice of the contemplation of the body, the practitioner learns to know long in-breaths and long out-breaths, short in-breaths and short out-breaths, then to experience the whole body of breath and to calm the bodily formations while breathing in and out. At that time, this is contemplating body in the body, dwelling with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, subduing sensual desire and sorrow toward the world, because the in-breath and out-breath themselves are part of the body.

In the practice of the contemplation of feelings, the practitioner learns to experience joy, to experience happiness, to experience the mental formations, and to calm the mental formations while breathing in and out. At that time, this is contemplating feelings in feelings, dwelling with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, subduing sensual desire and sorrow toward the world, because the wholesome attention to the in- and out-breath itself is a kind of feeling.

In the practice of the contemplation of mind, the practitioner learns to know the mind, to gladden the mind, to concentrate the mind, and to liberate the mind, all while breathing in and out. This is contemplating mind in the mind, dwelling with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, subduing sensual desire and sorrow toward the world. One who has lost mindfulness and lacks clear comprehension cannot practice mindfulness of breathing; therefore mindfulness and clear comprehension are especially important here.

In the practice of the contemplation of phenomena, the practitioner learns to contemplate impermanence, contemplate fading of desire, contemplate cessation, and contemplate relinquishment, all while breathing in and out. At that time, this is contemplating phenomena in phenomena, dwelling with ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, subduing sensual desire and sorrow toward the world, and using wisdom to contemplate and discern the cutting off of sensual desire and distress. In this way, starting from mindfulness of breathing, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Seven Factors of Awakening, and even knowledge and liberation can all be successively brought to completion.

XII.3 Mindfulness of Breathing as Leading to Knowledge and Liberation  
When a practitioner concentrates on one single practice—mindfulness of breathing— they are in fact simultaneously cultivating awareness of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena. As this capacity for awareness strengthens and the Four Foundations of Mindfulness deepen, the Seven Factors of Awakening gradually arise: from mindfulness, to investigation of dhammas, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity—each one maturing in turn. Ultimately, knowledge and liberation become complete; the practitioner, abiding in wisdom and freedom, is far removed from all defilements and suffering.

XIII. Sequence of Practice, Firm Strength, and Long-Term Cultivation

XIII.1 Wholesome Qualities that Grow Day and Night and the Non-Returning Mind  
In the basic requirements of practice, first, at the beginning of wholesome qualities one must purify moral discipline so that bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure and unstained; second, one must establish upright view and correct understanding. On this foundation, when one cultivates in reliance on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, one can see results in a relatively short time: wholesome qualities will continue to grow day and night and will not be easily diminished or destroyed.

When the mind has long inclined toward seclusion and renunciation, its firm strength is like a great river that naturally flows eastward, unable to be turned back by human effort. Once the mind truly takes renunciation as its direction, there is no longer any question of the mind of the path regressing; the tendency of moving toward Nibbāna and liberation becomes ever more stable.

XIII.2 Repeated and Deepening Cultivation of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness  
In practical essentials, a practitioner must cultivate continuously and without interruption, practicing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness repeatedly and in depth, rather than doing so only occasionally. The practice of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness requires “frequent cultivation”—that is, long-term and repeated contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, maintaining ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness in all kinds of circumstances.

At the same time, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness correspond to “mindfulness directed to the body” and to tranquility and insight. When a practitioner abides in the contemplation of the body, allowing the mind to become tranquil in observing the body, and then further using the wisdom of contemplation to examine the arising and ceasing of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, tranquility and insight can support each other, enabling the depth of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness to unfold ever further.

XIII.3 The Four Foundations of Mindfulness as the Sole Right Path Leading to the End of Suffering  
In the overall path of practice, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are regarded as the only right path that leads to the cessation of suffering. To master the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is to master the noble path that leads to the end of suffering; to lose the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is equivalent to losing the path that leads to the end of suffering. A practitioner must observe with an attitude of ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, the purpose being to subdue sensual desire and sorrow toward the world.

In the specific structure of contemplation, the contemplation of the body consists of contemplating the body as internal, as external, and as both internal and external; the contemplation of feelings consists of contemplating feelings as internal, as external, and as both internal and external; the contemplation of mind consists of contemplating mind as internal, as external, and as both internal and external; and the contemplation of phenomena consists of contemplating phenomena as internal, as external, and as both internal and external. The general guidelines for practice—namely, basing oneself on ardor, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, with the aim of subduing sensual desire and sorrow toward the world—apply completely to all specific objects of contemplation and their scope.

Because to master the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is to master the noble path leading to the end of suffering, a practitioner should cherish this method, nurture mindfulness and clear comprehension, and continually deepen the contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena, so that in this very life they may personally realize freedom from greed, freedom from suffering, and the state of liberation.</article>
