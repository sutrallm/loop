I. The Fundamental Value of Children and Women

I.1 The Fundamental Basis of Children’s Value  
When speaking of children, what truly determines their value is not their gender, but their virtue and wisdom. In other words, whether a person is worthy of being cherished does not depend on whether they are male or female, but on whether they possess good moral character and clear, discerning wisdom.  

The “virtue” spoken of here is not an abstract moral idea, but something concretely expressed in whether one can uphold precepts, exercise self-restraint, and abide by proper norms. When a child can put precepts into practice in daily life so that their conduct is guided by moral standards, this reveals a solid foundation of virtue. It is virtue of this kind, combined with wisdom, that truly constitutes the fundamental value of a child.

I.2 The Basic Qualities of a Virtuous Wife  
Within this value system, the fundamental qualities of a so‑called “virtuous wife” likewise begin with virtue and wisdom. First, in terms of personal cultivation, a virtuous wife must possess wisdom—being able to distinguish right from wrong and understand the principles of things—and at the same time must earnestly uphold precepts, taking self‑discipline as the rule of her life so that her words and actions all follow clear standards. Only when wisdom and observance of precepts go hand in hand can she be said to possess complete personal cultivation.

However, the qualities of a virtuous wife are not limited to inner cultivation; they must also be reflected in her family responsibilities. Within the family, a virtuous wife must know how to respect her mother‑in‑law, treating her with reverence as an elder, and showing respect and obedience in daily life and speech. In addition, she must devote herself to serving her husband—caring for him in daily life, supporting his body, mind, and career, and regarding service to her husband as one of her own responsibilities. Personal cultivation in wisdom and observance of precepts, together with respect for elders such as the mother‑in‑law within the family, and devoted service to her husband, together form the most fundamental qualities of a virtuous wife.

II. The Profound Influence of a Virtuous Wife on Family and Nation

II.1 The Achievements of Offspring and the Fate of the Nation  
When a woman possesses the above qualities of a virtuous wife, her influence within the family is by no means confined to the immediate sphere of daily life; it is deeply reflected in the achievements of the next generation. The sons born to such a virtuous wife can become true heroes, endowed with exceptional courage and ability, capable of shouldering heavy responsibilities and even becoming rulers of the nation, holding political authority and shaping the course of the state.  

A mother’s virtue and wisdom, conveyed through her teaching and personal example, permeate the character and talents of her children. Thus, her sons may not only become the mainstay of the family but also pillars of society and the nation.

II.2 Assistance to the Monarch and Governance of the State  
The influence of a virtuous wife is not only manifested in her children; it can also extend directly to the realm of governing the state. Such a woman can assist the monarch in handling affairs of state and become a powerful support to the ruler. She is not merely a passive supporter behind the scenes, but, relying on her own wisdom, can enlighten and remind the monarch.  

She can instruct the ruler in how to govern the country, helping him to make decisions that are more steady and comprehensive. Through her assistance and guidance, the monarch can exercise rule more in accord with moral principle and reason, and the governance of the country thereby becomes more complete. From this it can be seen that the presence of a virtuous wife not only affects family harmony and the achievements of children, but can even sway the fate of the entire nation and the quality of its rule.

III. The Five Special Sufferings Unique to Women

III.1 The Nature of the Sufferings and Their Capacity for Endurance  
When discussing the value and contributions of women, one must also recognize the various sufferings they endure in the course of life, especially the five special forms of hardship unique to women.  

First, in their youth, women often have to marry into their husband’s household, leaving their own natal family and kin, parting from the parents and siblings they know so well, and going to live in a family that is not yet familiar to them. This situation of leaving one’s own relatives and marrying into another household is in itself a kind of unavoidable suffering.  

Second, women must face the affliction of menstruation: the regular bleeding of the body brings inconvenience and discomfort, constituting both a physical burden and a disruption to daily life.  

Furthermore, when a woman becomes pregnant, her body and mind must endure the hardships of gestation. From the gradual changes in her body to various discomforts and the weight she must carry, it is a prolonged ordeal. When it comes time to give birth, she must then face the pain of childbirth—an extremely intense and indescribable suffering that requires great strength of will to get through.  

In addition, in their roles within family and society, women are often expected to serve men. They must care for their husbands or other male family members in daily life and regard such service as part of their own responsibility. This, too, is a continuous physical and psychological burden.

Taken together, over the course of their lives women must bear the pain of leaving their own families to marry into another household, endure the troubles of menstruation, face the bodily hardships of pregnancy and childbirth, and continually serve men in daily life. These five special sufferings intertwine to form a uniquely heavy life experience for women.  

It is worth noting that, when facing these hardships, women are often more able than men to endure such suffering. That is to say, although the pains they bear are many and profound, in terms of patience and capacity to endure, women are generally more resilient than men. They are able to sustain their lives amid these trials and fulfill the various roles and responsibilities that family and society place upon them.
