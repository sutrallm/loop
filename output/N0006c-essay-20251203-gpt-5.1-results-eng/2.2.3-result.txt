<title> Key Points of Practice and the Complete Cultivation of the Five Faculties and Five Powers </title>
<article>
I. Obstacles to Practice and the Supporting Factors for Liberation

I.1 Overcoming Obstacles in Practice  
In the course of practice one must first recognize and overcome the factors that obstruct the noble path. Oversleeping, laziness and procrastination, and overeating are direct causes that block the arising of the noble path. These conditions make body and mind heavy, dull, and scattered, preventing practice from deepening and continuing; therefore they must be counteracted with an attitude of unwavering effort.

Practitioners should consciously arouse a mind of vigor, and continue to apply themselves in practice. Through diligent conduct they clear away all obstacles caused by sleep, laziness, and overindulgence in food, so that the mind and will remain alert and firm, allowing the noble path to unfold without obstruction.

I.2 Cultivations Required for Liberation  
To truly move toward liberation, the practitioner must possess several indispensable forms of cultivation. First, one must skillfully cultivate samādhi so that the mind attains stability and calm abiding. Through correct cultivation of concentration, the mind is no longer dragged about by defilement and distraction, and only then can one proceed to rightly contemplate all phenomena.

Next, one must directly see the mind of liberation—that is, actually experience the state in which the mind is freed from the bonds of afflictions, rather than merely understanding it conceptually or through hearing and reflection. Furthermore, when “formations (activities)” are present, one must be able to bring forth wholesome actions rather than suppress them—that is, amid conditioned activities, skillfully cause proper conduct and right action to arise, rather than wrongly repressing or distorting it.

One must also use right conduct to subdue the afflictions, so that all actions of body, speech, and mind become forces that tame such defilements as greed, hatred, and delusion. In this way, by subduing afflictions and unfolding both concentration and wisdom, liberation ceases to be merely theoretical and becomes a directly realizable state of mind.

II. The Practice Attainments of a Superior Recipient of Offerings

In discussing the “field of merit” to whom offerings are made, the reason a superior recipient is worthy of respect is not merely due to status, but because such a person has fully perfected many aspects of practice. Such a recipient has become completely flawless in moral discipline, maintaining purity of body, speech, and mind without transgression, and thus possesses fully accomplished virtuous conduct (sīla).

At the same time, their mental calm is also completely perfected: they can abide in stillness, undisturbed by distraction and delusion. In terms of wisdom, they have completely perfected the direct, accurate seeing of phenomena as they really are, not being covered by distorted perceptions. Further, they have completely perfected mental liberation, having directly realized a liberated mind free from the bonds of afflictions.

Finally, their wisdom with regard to liberation is also completely perfected: not only have they attained liberation, but their wisdom, understanding, and contemplative insight into liberation are fully mature; they can accurately know the nature and domain of liberation. One who possesses these five fully perfected attainments of practice is a superior recipient of offerings.

III. General Rules for Practicing with Wholesome and Unwholesome States, and the Four Right Efforts

III.1 A General Rule Applicable to Wholesome and Unwholesome States  
In all concrete situations of practice there is one basic rule of universal application that guides how a practitioner should counteract unwholesome states and cultivate wholesome ones. According to this rule, the practitioner should apply the same principle in four specific situations:

First, prevent unarisen unwholesome states from arising; that is, before unwholesome states appear, one uses watchfulness and guarding so that they do not arise.

Second, abandon already arisen unwholesome states: when unwholesome states are already operating, one should find ways to drive them away and cut them off so that they do not continue.

Third, cause unarisen wholesome states to arise: for wholesome states that have not yet appeared, one should actively create the conditions for them to sprout.

Fourth, maintain already arisen wholesome states so that they do not cease—preserving existing wholesome states so they are not lost, and further doubling, expanding, and cultivating them toward perfection.

This rule functions as an overall guideline and is to be applied universally across various aspects of practice.

III.2 The Content of the Four Right Efforts and the Attitude of Practice  
In concrete cultivation, this general rule is explicitly formulated as four correct exertions, namely the four right efforts. Their content is as follows: first, with respect to unarisen unwholesome states, one should arouse determination and proper intention so that these unwholesome states do not arise.

Second, with regard to already arisen unwholesome states, one should take their cutting off as the goal, using right mindfulness, clear comprehension, and right conduct to bring them to complete cessation.

Third, regarding unarisen wholesome states, one should actively cultivate the conditions that enable them to arise, not allowing wholesome seeds to remain latent and without opportunity to develop.

Fourth, with respect to already arisen wholesome states, one should make them firm, not allowing them to be lost, while further doubling and broadly cultivating them until they reach complete perfection.

In the process of practicing the four right efforts, one must uphold these four exertions with the correct attitude. For states that have not yet arisen—whether the aim is to bring wholesome states into existence or to prevent unwholesome states from arising—the practitioner should arouse aspiration, strive diligently, and rouse the mind, giving no opening to laziness and heedlessness.

For states that have already arisen—whether the aim is to abandon unwholesome states or to maintain, expand, and perfect wholesome ones—one likewise needs to arouse resolve, exert energy, and stir up the mind, persevering without giving up. This volition, vigor, and exertion must further be implemented in the actual functioning of body and mind: during practice one maintains focused attention and continually spurs on the mind, so that the four right efforts are transformed from abstract principles into concrete, present-moment conduct.

III.3 The Four Right Efforts in Relation to Moral Discipline and the Abandoning of the “Searches” and the Higher Fetters  
The cultivation of the four right efforts is not carried out in isolation; it must rely on and be established upon moral discipline. That is, the practitioner should take precepts as their support, using pure moral conduct as the foundation for cultivating the four right efforts, and should practice these four correct exertions frequently, repeatedly nurturing them until they become a stable pattern of mind.

When a practitioner aspires to know, fully understand, completely exhaust, and abandon the “three kinds of search,” the fundamental method to be relied upon is the cultivation of the four right efforts. To achieve this, one should practice according to the content of the four right efforts: for unarisen unwholesome states, strive to prevent their arising; for arisen unwholesome states, strive for their abandonment; for unarisen wholesome states, strive for their arising; for arisen wholesome states, strive for their stability, non-loss, increase, expansion, and eventual perfection. Throughout this whole process one should arouse resolve, apply vigorous effort, and mobilize body and mind, maintaining continuous focused attention.

When the goal shifts to knowing, fully understanding, completely exhausting, and abandoning the five higher fetters, the same principles of cultivation still apply. For this purpose, one should cultivate the four right efforts so that, when facing the five higher fetters, the mind can apply the same four exertions: on one hand, prevent unarisen unwholesome states from arising and bring arisen unwholesome states to cessation; on the other hand, cause unarisen wholesome states to arise and make arisen wholesome states dwell, not be lost, be doubly cultivated, broadly cultivated, and perfected. In every kind of exertion, one must arouse resolve, energy, and effort, urging on and sustaining the mind, so that the four right efforts can function effectively in the process of abandoning the higher fetters.

IV. Practical Guidelines for the Liberation of Loving-kindness

Among the many methods of practice, the liberation of loving-kindness is an important path to liberation. For those who wish to achieve success in this method, they should first set a clear intention, resolving to cultivate the liberation of loving-kindness, and repeatedly practice it—not merely occasionally, but by continually nurturing and expanding loving-kindness in daily life.

The practitioner should keep accumulating various wholesome states, so that the cultivation of loving-kindness is not isolated, but shines forth in concert with a broad range of wholesome deeds. At the same time, one should skillfully plan the practice so that the cultivation of the liberation of loving-kindness proceeds in an orderly and directed way—properly arranged in terms of both time and content—avoiding fragmentation and scatter. In this way, the liberation of loving-kindness can truly become a stable pillar leading toward liberation.

V. The Systematic Path to Nibbāna and the Fruit of the Noble Eightfold Path

V.1 Multiple Effective Paths to Nibbāna  
Nibbāna is not attainable only through a single method of practice; rather, it can be reached by many paths of cultivation. Various methods of practice, as long as they are correct and in accordance with Dhamma, can all serve as effective roads to Nibbāna.

Among the many systematized paths of practice, particular emphasis is given to one systematic path that encompasses a wide range of content, including the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path.

The four establishments of mindfulness are the practice of right mindfulness directed toward body, feelings, mind, and phenomena as objects of contemplation. The four right efforts are the correct exertions that counteract unwholesome states and promote wholesome ones. The four bases of spiritual power are those path factors by which one develops samādhi based on specific grounds and thereby accomplishes spiritual power.

The five faculties are the five fundamental abilities of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. The five powers are these same five, regarded as powerful forces specifically for counteracting defilements. The seven factors of enlightenment are the seven qualities that lead toward awakening. The noble eightfold path is the right path that encompasses morality, concentration, and wisdom and leads to the noble fruit.

These methods support each other, forming a tightly structured and complete system of practice, all of which can effectively lead to Nibbāna.

V.2 Abandoning Unwholesome States Through Practice of the Noble Eightfold Path  
Within this systematic path, the noble eightfold path plays an especially crucial role. When the practitioner continuously cultivates the noble eightfold path and follows it over a long period without slackening, they are sure to utterly remove unwholesome states that had previously existed; once these unwholesome states have been abandoned, they do not arise again.

This means that practice of the noble eightfold path not only temporarily suppresses unwholesome states, but also uproots them completely so that they no longer serve as sources of future affliction. Through the complete practice of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration, unwholesome states are finally purified in their entirety.

VI. Definition, Cultivation, and Benefits of the Five Faculties

VI.1 The Content of the Five Faculties and Their Fundamental Qualities  
Among all path factors that lead to awakening, the five faculties are a central foundation of practice. Their content comprises the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. On one hand, these five faculties function as fundamental Dhammas that lead to awakening; on the other, they are regarded as key factors for realizing the ultimate deathless, inclining toward the deathless, and fully arriving at the deathless. When the practitioner cultivates and repeatedly cultivates these five faculties, body and mind are thereby directed toward the domain of the deathless—Nibbāna—free from the bondage of the round of birth and death.

Among all attainments of liberation, four are regarded as fundamental qualities: the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. These four basic qualities jointly support the progress of practice, enabling the practitioner to proceed step by step from initial cultivation toward deeper stillness and liberation.

Within these, three fundamental abilities are especially emphasized: the faculties of mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. The faculty of mindfulness is the ability of focused awareness that allows the mind to clearly and continuously know the present object. The faculty of concentration is the ability of mental stability that keeps the mind undistracted and settled on a single object. The faculty of wisdom is the ability of accurate insight, enabling the practitioner to see the true nature of phenomena as they really are, without being deceived by delusive thoughts. As these three basic abilities gradually mature, they become indispensable pillars of awakening.

VI.2 The Contemplation and Definition of the Faculty of Faith and the Faculty of Energy  
In actual contemplation, each of the five faculties has its own specific field of development and definition. The faculty of faith should be cultivated in relation to the four factors of stream-entry; that is, through four conditions connected with the fruit of stream-entry, one establishes and strengthens faith. Through the accomplishment of these conditions, the practitioner’s confidence in the Three Jewels and the true Dhamma steadily grows firm and unshakable.

The faculty of energy should be cultivated in the context of the four right efforts. That is, the arising and strengthening of the faculty of energy comes about through repeated practice of the four right efforts: countering unarisen unwholesome states, abandoning arisen unwholesome states, promoting unarisen wholesome states, and increasing arisen wholesome states, thereby establishing a strong and unwavering energy.

By definition, the faculty of faith means that a noble disciple generates firm and unshakable confidence in the Buddha’s awakening. This faith is concretely expressed as affirmation of the Buddha’s awakening and qualities: believing that the Blessed One is an Arahant, perfectly enlightened, consummate in true knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.

The faculty of energy means that a noble disciple can arouse effort and remain energetic, striving to abandon all unwholesome states and to perfect all wholesome states, displaying a courageous and steadfast spirit, unwilling to give up wholesome states or cast off their yoke. In concrete practice, the faculty of energy manifests on multiple levels: on one hand, with respect to unarisen unwholesome states, one ensures they do not arise; on the other hand, with respect to arisen unwholesome states, one brings about their abandonment. At the same time, for unarisen wholesome states one causes them to arise; for arisen wholesome states one causes them to remain, not be forgotten, and to be doubled, expanded, and cultivated to perfection. Regarding all these, the practitioner must arouse desire (aspiration), exert energy, apply effort, and spur on the mind, so that energy becomes a continuous and powerful driving force.

VI.3 The Power and Sequential Fulfillment of the Faculties of Mindfulness, Concentration, and Wisdom  
Among the three fundamental abilities—the faculties of mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom—each has its specific function and mode of sequential fulfillment. The function of the faculty of mindfulness is focused awareness, enabling the practitioner to maintain clear observation in all situations of walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. On the basis of energetic practice, the faculty of mindfulness arises and increases: through continual effort one cultivates clear awareness, and ultimately attains the most excellent recollective wisdom, able to recall clearly everything previously done and said, without being obscured by forgetfulness and confusion.

When the faculty of mindfulness has matured, it can then bring about the fulfillment of the faculty of concentration. In practice based on mindfulness as a tether, the practitioner takes the abandoning of defilements as the object of concentration—that is, making the removal of defilements and purification of the mind the focus of attention. Through stable mindfulness and continual observation, the mind gradually attains the settled state of one-pointedness, accomplishing the meditative skill of mental unification. This faculty of concentration is not merely temporary quietude, but a power that maintains one-pointed focus even when facing defilements and external conditions.

The faculty of wisdom, based on the preceding mindfulness and concentration, exercises its capacity for accurate insight. Through repeated contemplative investigation with wisdom, the practitioner clearly sees the arising and passing away of phenomena, and their characteristics of suffering, emptiness, impermanence, and non-self, thereby abandoning distorted grasping with regard to phenomena.

When these forms of cultivation—energy, recollection, concentration, and wisdom—operate repeatedly, the five faculties can be fully accomplished. By repeatedly applying energetic effort, the faculty of energy grows increasingly firm; by constantly cultivating recollection, the faculty of mindfulness keeps expanding; by repeatedly entering concentration, the faculty of concentration becomes more stable; by repeated contemplative investigation, the faculty of wisdom grows sharper and sharper. In this cyclical process, one finally attains a state in which the five faculties are fully matured.

VI.4 The Method of Cultivating the Five Faculties and Their Supporting Basis  
The cultivation of the five faculties has common fundamental methods and a shared supporting basis. First, cultivation of the five faculties must rely on the state of non-negligence (heedfulness). Non-negligence means guarding the mind so that it does not fall into distraction and unwholesome conduct, remaining distant from defilements and all phenomena that arise together with them. Only on the basis of non-negligence can the five faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom truly grow, rather than being eroded by heedlessness.

As for specific methods, the common principle for cultivating the five faculties is to practice them relying on seclusion, on dispassion, and on cessation, and to direct them toward letting go. That is, in nurturing the five faculties, the practitioner should rely on seclusion from sensual pleasures and unwholesome states, take non-greed (dispassion) as the direction, aim at the cessation of all defilements and causes of suffering, and in the process incline the mind toward relinquishment: no longer clinging to any object, circumstance, or Dhamma, and even releasing any self-view bound up with the wholesome qualities being cultivated.

This mode of practice—“relying on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, and directing toward letting go”—applies not only to the five faculties, but also to the five powers, which are identical with them in nature.

In further summarizing the aspect of cultivation, the basic method for the five faculties is simply to cultivate the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, and to cultivate them frequently, so that these five remain long present in the mind, rather than appearing only as brief, occasional mental states.

VI.5 The Five Faculties as Factors Leading to Awakening and Nibbāna  
The five faculties are not only fundamental requisites for practice; they are also key elements that lead to awakening and Nibbāna. The five—faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom—are collectively termed factors on the side of awakening, all serving as aids leading to awakening. Among these five, the faculty of wisdom is especially emphasized as the foremost and most excellent in leading to awakening. Though faith, energy, mindfulness, and concentration are all indispensable, without the accurate insight provided by the faculty of wisdom one cannot truly break through ignorance and attain complete awakening.

Regarding the goal of Nibbāna, cultivation of the five faculties causes one to incline toward, tend toward, and draw near to Nibbāna. That is, through the accumulation and maturation of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, the practitioner’s mind naturally leans toward and approaches Nibbāna, and ultimately directly realizes it. The content of the five faculties here is clearly specified as including faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, none of which can be omitted.

Moreover, in concrete cultivation there is also a general principle that applies to the practice of the five faculties: one must cultivate them relying on seclusion, on dispassion, and on cessation, and direct them toward letting go. The practitioner should apply this principle in cultivating each of the five—faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom—so that they grow not merely within the sphere of mundane wholesome qualities, but further guide the mind away from craving and attachment, finally resting in relinquishment.

VI.6 The Five Faculties in Abandoning Greed, Hatred, Delusion, and the Five Higher Fetters  
The cultivation of the five faculties is directly connected with the abandoning of defilements and the realization of liberation. When a practitioner wishes to know, fully understand, completely exhaust, and abandon the five higher fetters, they should cultivate the five faculties, using them as the fundamental method for abandoning the higher fetters. This principle is repeatedly emphasized: if one wishes to completely know, fully comprehend, fully extinguish, and abandon the five higher fetters, one should cultivate the five faculties without neglect.

Among the key points of cultivating the five faculties, the first is their shared method of practice: they are all to be cultivated relying on seclusion, on dispassion, and on cessation, and directed toward letting go. The faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom all become purified and mature through this method.

Individually, each faculty should be cultivated according to this common principle: the faculty of faith should rely on seclusion and dispassion to establish pure confidence in perfect awakening, and be directed toward the relinquishment of clinging; the faculty of energy should be based on non-sensuality, courageous and unremitting, yet free from pride and attachment; the faculty of mindfulness should be oriented toward the extinction of defilements, remaining clear and unforgetful, yet not clinging to its objects; the faculty of concentration should rest upon seclusion and quietude, abiding unshaken without attachment to states of concentration; the faculty of wisdom should take the extinction of the causes of suffering as its aim, accurately contemplating all phenomena, and ultimately relinquishing all forms of clinging.

The shared objective in cultivating the five faculties is to thoroughly subdue greed, thoroughly subdue hatred, and thoroughly subdue delusion. That is, the five faculties are not neutral mental factors, but active tools for counteracting the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion. The practitioner counters doubt and wrong faith in the true path through the pure confidence of the faculty of faith; counters laziness and heedlessness through the faculty of energy; counters distraction and forgetfulness through the faculty of mindfulness; counters mental agitation and restlessness through the faculty of concentration; counters ignorance and distorted views through the faculty of wisdom.

In concrete terms, the practitioner should cultivate each faculty—faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom—so that these five aspects of practice gradually increase and mature in the mind, finally achieving the thorough subjugation of greed, hatred, and delusion.

VI.7 The Security of Liberation and the Basis of Faith for One Endowed with the Five Faculties  
In some cases, a practitioner, though not yet fully purified in faith regarding the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and not yet possessing quick or sharp wisdom, nor having truly realized liberation, nevertheless, if they are already endowed with the five faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, still possesses great security with respect to liberation.

Such a practitioner, though not yet perfectly and completely confident in the Three Jewels, and not yet having attained ultimate purity of faith in them, has already fully accomplished the five faculties. Because of possessing these five faculties, they will not fall into hell, the animal realm, or the realm of hungry ghosts, nor will they wander into various other bad births and evil destinations. This security from falling into unfortunate realms arises precisely from the presence and functioning of the five faculties.

Moreover, one endowed with the five faculties also shows distinct advantages and merits in practice. Such a person is able to use wisdom to contemplate the true Dhamma spoken by the Buddha to some extent—that is, even though they have not yet attained fully developed wisdom and vision, they can still apply wisdom in a certain degree of contemplation and understanding, rather than merely following blindly. At the same time, they take the Tathāgata as the only object of faith and love, regarding the Tathāgata as the single focus of confidence and devotion, with the mind no longer dispersed toward other false or mixed beliefs.

Though they have not yet reached complete conviction and perfect purification of faith in the Three Jewels, because they are endowed with the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, and have taken the Tathāgata as their sole refuge, they have already obtained a firm foundation and protection on the path to liberation.

VII. The Identity of the Five Faculties and Five Powers, and the Practice Functions of the Five Powers

VII.1 The Five Faculties and Five Powers as Different Names for the Same Reality  
In the theory of practice, the five faculties and the five powers, though verbally distinct, are identical in essence. There is a specific rationale that explains that the five faculties are precisely the five powers, and the five powers are precisely the five faculties. This rationale reveals that beneath the difference in terminology, the two are actually different aspects of the same Dhamma.

In content, the faculty of faith and the power of faith are one and the same: the faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. The same is true of energy: the faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. Similarly for mindfulness: the faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. Likewise for concentration: the faculty of concentration is the power of concentration, and the power of concentration is the faculty of concentration. And similarly for wisdom: the faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom.

From this we can see that the terms “faculty” (root) and “power” both refer in essence to the same inner qualities, differing only in emphasis: “faculty” highlights their role as roots from which wholesome states arise, while “power” highlights their role as forces that counteract defilements.

VII.2 Definition, Cultivation, and the Fetters-Ending Aim of the Five Powers  
In specific definition, the five powers consist of the power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom. The power of faith is the force of firm and unshakable right confidence, capable of resisting wrong views and doubt. The power of energy is the force of courageous and tireless exertion, which can overcome laziness and heedlessness. The power of mindfulness is the force of continuous and unfailing right mindfulness, which can counter forgetfulness and distraction. The power of concentration is the force of firm mental unification, which can subdue restless thoughts and delusion. The power of wisdom is the force of accurate, penetrating insight, which can destroy ignorance and wrong views.

Since the five powers and the five faculties are identical in essence, the five powers should likewise be cultivated and repeatedly cultivated, so that they become enduring and strong forces of counteraction.

In actual method, the powers of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom should all be cultivated relying on seclusion, on dispassion, and on cessation, and directed toward letting go. This means that the development of the five powers is not for increasing attachment to worldly things, but to help the practitioner move away from sensual pleasures and unwholesome states, reduce and finally eliminate clinging, move toward the extinction of all defilements, and ultimately rest in a state of relinquishment. Through such practice, the five powers become not only forces for increasing wholesome states, but also powerful tools for abandoning defilements and the phenomena bound up with them.

The five powers are closely related to the abandonment of the five higher fetters. When a practitioner aspires to know, fully understand, completely exhaust, and abandon the five higher fetters, they should cultivate the five powers. That is, the powers of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom are regarded as important methods for countering the five higher fetters. The five powers enable the practitioner to gain thorough understanding and penetrating realization of the five higher fetters, and then to fully comprehend and completely exhaust them, finally bringing about their complete abandonment. Because the five powers possess such an ability to counteract, they are explicitly stated, in summary, to be crucial forces for knowing, fully understanding, completely exhausting, and abandoning the five higher fetters.

VIII. The Practice of the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and the Four Establishments of Mindfulness

VIII.1 General Principles for Cultivating the Four Bases of Spiritual Power and Common Rules for Diligent Practice  
Among the path factors, the four bases of spiritual power are Dhammas by which one attains mental unification in a distinctive way. Cultivating the four bases of spiritual power requires two major elements: first, cultivating samādhi based on specific grounds so as to attain mental unification; second, engaging in diligent practice to deal with wholesome and unwholesome states. When these two elements are combined, spiritual power is accomplished. That is, on one hand one must cultivate concentration on a particular object so that the mind focuses and attains one-pointedness; on the other, one must, through diligent practice, actively apply the principles of the four right abandonings (four right efforts) to deal with unarisen unwholesome states, arisen unwholesome states, unarisen wholesome states, and arisen wholesome states. When these two aspects are both complete, one can attain accomplishment in the four bases of spiritual power.

In its core method, the cultivation of the four bases of spiritual power must center on diligently practicing the four right abandonings. This includes preventing unarisen unwholesome states from arising, causing arisen unwholesome states to be abandoned, bringing unarisen wholesome states to arise, and enabling arisen wholesome states to remain, not be forgotten, be doubly cultivated, broadly cultivated, and perfectly accomplished.

In concrete practice, one should act according to the principles of diligently performing the four right abandonings: arousing desire (aspiration), applying energy, exerting effort, and urging on the mind; that is, giving rise to the intention to practice, and sustaining practice through constant energy and exertion, so that the mind continually advances toward the perfection of wholesome states and the abandoning of unwholesome states. In this way, the one-pointedness of samādhi combined with the diligent practice of the four right abandonings together constitutes the general method for cultivating the four bases of spiritual power.

VIII.2 Practitioners Who Diligently Cultivate the Four Establishments of Mindfulness  
In the practice of the four establishments of mindfulness (four foundations of mindfulness), special emphasis is placed on the practitioner having the quality of vigor. Those called practitioners of the four establishments of mindfulness are those who frequently cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness, who are skillful in tethring the mind to the four objects of contemplation—body, feelings, mind, and phenomena.

That is, these practitioners are able to keep their minds abiding for long periods in the four establishments of mindfulness, continuously binding the mind with right mindfulness and contemplating the changes of the body, the arising and vanishing of feelings, the dynamics of mental states, and the true nature of all phenomena. By thus diligently cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness, they cause the faculty of mindfulness to grow, and lay a solid foundation for the subsequent fulfillment of concentration and wisdom.
