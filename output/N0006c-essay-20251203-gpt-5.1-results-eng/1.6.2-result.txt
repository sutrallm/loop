I. The Root of Rebirth and the Nature of Life and Death

I.1 Craving, Ignorance, and the Fear of Death

Beings continue to revolve in birth and death because their hearts are filled with craving; this craving becomes the fundamental cause for the arising of life. Thus the human mind never stops chasing and rushing about, pursuing sensual pleasures and all kinds of experiences. As a result, it is instead dragged along by these attachments and falls into the cycle of rebirth. Although beings in saṃsāra rely on karma as their support — continuing to be reborn by the power of the actions they themselves have done — at the same time they are unable to be liberated because of the suffering produced by this very karma. These pains and afflictions are in fact the greatest fear in their hearts.

Not knowing the method to extinguish suffering, and not understanding the true path of renunciation, beings, after death, are compelled to return to this world and again undergo birth and death. Ignorance covers everything, and craving binds sentient beings like ropes; thus they revolve ceaselessly in the round of birth and death — dying in this world to be reborn in another, then dying in that world to return here again — back and forth without end.

If a person carefully observes life, he will see the nature of birth and death: once there is birth, one has already stepped onto the road toward death; life is inevitably short. The coming of old age further deprives one of protection and support. When one perceives the dreadfulness and inevitability of death, one can give rise to a genuine fear of death, and thus become willing to abandon sensual craving and aspire to peace and renunciation. When someone originally believes that his existence is permanent, solid, and eternal — as do certain long-lived gods — if he hears the Tathāgata’s teaching, or the Dharma explained by arahants, he then realizes that he is actually impermanent, unstable, and non-eternal, merely an existence “encompassed by a body.” This understanding arouses great fear, trembling, and terror, and makes him truly awaken to the fact that he is not something firm and reliable.

I.2 The Universality of Birth, Aging, Illness, and Death, and the Absence of Refuge

Whether ordinary beings, or householders and brahmins possessing great wealth and status, even if they own vast property and large amounts of gold, silver, and grain, as long as they “are born,” they cannot escape aging and death. This reality — that “all beings are of the nature to die” — is universal and inevitable: every sentient being is destined eventually to die; no one can surpass death.

When beings clearly see this truth and understand that the very nature of life is that birth leads toward death and old age leads to the loss of shelter, and when they also realize that saṃsāra itself is filled with suffering, sorrow, and loss, that this long wandering is nothing but the continual accumulation of anguish, they begin to reflect: if they continue to be dominated by craving and ignorance, then after death they will still be reborn again, still unable to escape the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, death, and all the rest of the dukkha.

I.3 The Long and Inconceivable Course of Saṃsāra

The process of rebirth is not only full of suffering; it is also so long as to defy imagination. During this boundless stretch of time, beings have already accumulated countless pains, griefs, and losses. If we explain this with various similes, we can get a faint glimpse of its vastness: suppose the entire great earth were turned into little pellets of soil the size of jujube seeds to count, one by one, all those who have been one’s fathers in past lives; or suppose all the grasses and trees in Jambudvīpa were gathered together to count, one by one, all those who have been one’s mothers. Before such counting could be completed, the earth and plants would already be exhausted. Again, the tears beings have shed through life after life due to meeting those they hate and parting from those they love, and the mother’s milk they have sucked throughout countless births, have already exceeded the waters of the four great oceans.

From the perspective of time, suppose there is a huge mountain of stone, a yojana in length and width, which is gently wiped with a soft cloth once every hundred years until the mountain is completely worn away; or suppose there is a city of iron, likewise a yojana square, from which a single mustard seed is taken out every hundred years until all the seeds are exhausted. Even such an immensely long period is still not enough to complete a single “kalpa.” A kalpa is thus so long that it cannot be measured by ordinary numbers, and the number of kalpas through which beings have wandered in saṃsāra far exceeds even this. Thus each and every being, in the long course of wandering, has certainly experienced suffering and misfortune as well as enjoyment and prosperity; they have been one another’s fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and so on. They have also been born in various forms such as bulls, buffaloes, rams, goats, deer, dogs, and pigs, and have suffered because of evil deeds they once did, just as bandits who are captured are punished.

II. The Fundamental Laws of Karma and Cause and Effect

II.1 The Definition, Classification, and “Ever-Following” Nature of Karma

Beings revolve within saṃsāra by relying on karmic force, which allows their existence to continue; therefore, understanding the nature and classification of karma is extremely important. What is called “old karma” refers to the results accumulated from past actions, thoughts, and feelings, which have already manifested upon the present six sense bases — that is, the current functioning state of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. “New karma,” on the other hand, is all the actions now being performed through body, speech, and mind; these actions will form corresponding results in the future.

In terms of modes of action, deeds are divided into three broad categories: bodily action, verbal action, and mental action — that is, the doings of the body, speech, and mind. From the perspective of dependent origination, “formations (saṅkhārā)” are the driving forces formed by these three kinds of actions. “Birth” refers to the arising and appearance of all types of beings: conception, emergence from the womb, being born, the manifestation of the aggregates, and gaining existence in various places. “Existence (bhava)” refers to the three spheres of existence: existence in the realm of sensual desire (kāmadhātu), existence in the realm of form (rūpadhātu), and existence in the formless realm (ārūpadhātu), within which beings revolve according to their karma.

All actions can be classified not only by type — body, speech, and mind — but also by quality: wholesome and unwholesome. Regarding intention, when the mindset and volition behind an action increase beings’ greed, hatred, and delusion, that action is unwholesome; if the action and its accompanying intention do not increase these three poisons, it is wholesome. Once actions of body, speech, and mind have been done, whether wholesome or unwholesome, they continue to accompany the doer forever and are thus called the truly “ever-following possessions.” In human life, wealth, relatives, status, and even one’s body cannot always accompany a sentient being, but karmic force will continue to shape one’s destiny in this life and in future lives.

II.2 Wholesome and Unwholesome Actions and Their Results

When a person acts in ignorance, it is as though he were an enemy to himself. As he commits various evil deeds, he is bound to attract painful results; if he fails to do wholesome deeds, he will in the end also fall into distress. When the time comes for him to bear painful results, he can only grieve and weep, powerless to change it. Conversely, if he practices wholesome karma in body, speech, and mind, once the deeds are done his mind will not be troubled, but instead filled with joy and ease, and he is certain to reap happiness as future results.

The impact of an evil mind is particularly evident, bringing three main negative consequences: first, harm — damage done to others; second, suffering — causing others pain; third, unrest — preventing others from dwelling at ease. In the same way, false speech has its own universal pattern: lying is not just a temporary fault; it leads to long-term harm and suffering, and will eventually ripen into bitter fruits, which are themselves evil. These unwholesome results are not confined to this very life; they may not be fully manifested until future existences, or even over a very long period.

On the concrete level, there is a clear correspondence between actions and results. Those who kill others will in future meet with the result of being killed; those who have conquered others will in future meet with the result of being conquered; those who have mocked and ridiculed others will in future meet with the result of being slandered; those who have harassed and tormented others will eventually experience being harassed and tormented; those who, for their own benefit, seize the property of others will later be plundered by others; those who injure others will in the end be injured by others. This relationship between actions and retribution forms an unbroken cycle. Whether wholesome or unwholesome, all actions produce corresponding karmic retributions, and this law operates independently of anyone’s wishes.

II.3 The Time and Form in Which Karmic Results Appear

The seeds sown by unwholesome actions will inevitably bear the fruit of suffering; this is the basic rule governing the development of karmic results. Although the consequences of actions may not appear immediately, they will certainly manifest when conditions have matured. At times, unwholesome deeds seem to bring short-term benefits and advantages, yet in the end they must still yield painful results — something the foolish cannot perceive. Fools often think that evil actions can bring true benefit, even regarding the harming of others as legitimate conduct, completely unaware of the inevitability of karmic law.

The manifestation of karmic results is not limited to a single lifetime. The form one takes after death and the suffering one endures are wholly determined by the karma created while alive; the residual power of that karma will, when it ripens, concretely appear as a particular painful experience. These karmic results continue to manifest after death and are not confined to this one life; moreover, the specific form of the result precisely corresponds to the nature of the unwholesome actions done previously. Thus all evil deeds must inevitably attract corresponding painful retributions; when the karma ripens, one will undergo torment in hell, and even after the hellish retribution is exhausted, the residual karmic force will continue to bring further specific forms of suffering. The duration of suffering in hell is extremely long — it may last for many years, many hundreds of years, many thousands of years, or even many hundreds of thousands of years. Because all evil deeds must yield corresponding results, we say, “Karma does not deceive.”

However, the results of evil karma do not necessarily appear immediately in this life. The fortunes and misfortunes, pleasures and pains that a person experiences now cannot fully reflect the wholesome or unwholesome quality of all past and present actions. One must rely on wisdom that transcends the appearances of this single life in order to understand the overall operation of karmic law. Otherwise, to insist that “anyone who destroys life, steals, engages in sexual misconduct, lies, and so on, must inevitably experience sorrow and suffering in this very life” is contrary to the facts and is a false statement.

In real situations, some people suppress the king’s enemies and kill them, and thereby receive the king’s rewards, enjoying fine clothes and various ornaments. Some steal valuable treasures and offer them to the king, gaining favor and enjoying wealth and honor. Some consort with the women of the king’s enemies and please the king, receiving gifts and pleasures. Some make the king laugh with lies and are likewise richly rewarded, living comfortably. These cases show that evildoers do not necessarily suffer immediately in this life; on the contrary, they may temporarily enjoy good fortune.

There are also opposite examples: some, because they have taken another’s life, are arrested, their hands bound, paraded through the market for all to see, and finally beheaded. Some, because they stole property, are arrested, likewise bound and beheaded. Some, for having relations with respectable women, are arrested and punished; some, for harming others’ interests, are arrested, bound, paraded, and beheaded. Because reality displays many possibilities, to cling to the claim that “all evil karma must be repaid in this life” is to hold a mistaken view that does not accord with the truth. Those who promote such statements speak falsehood; they are stained in moral conduct, walk in evil ways, and adhere to wrong views — and those who hold wrong views are not worthy of trust.

II.4 Karmic Results Across Three Lifetimes

Karmic law not only governs what is encountered in this life; it also runs through past, present, and future, connecting the three periods. A being’s wealth and social status are determined by karma done in the past; every action gives rise to a corresponding result, and these results in turn determine one’s destiny and good fortune in this life and in future lives. Some good fortune manifests as abundant property, but there may also be a “lack of capacity to enjoy” — even with resources, one may be unable truly to enjoy good food, fine clothing, comfortable vehicles, and the pleasures of the five senses.

When beings come to the end of their lives, their ultimate destination is entirely determined by the wholesome or unwholesome nature of their bodily, verbal, and mental actions. Initial conditions do not determine the final outcome; the nature of one’s actions is the decisive factor. If one’s body, speech, and mind all commit unwholesome deeds, the end of that life will inevitably incline toward darkness; if they all do wholesome deeds, the end will naturally incline toward brightness. The starting point cannot alter this correspondence between actions and final destination.

All beings act in accordance with their karma and are reborn according to their merits and demerits. On the basis of evil karma they fall into hell and other bad destinations; on the basis of meritorious deeds they are born in heavenly realms and other good destinies. If someone practices virtue and diligently carries out good deeds, these merits pave the way for the future. Merit is in fact wholesome action that benefits others, and in later lives it becomes a means for oneself to cross over the sea of birth-and-death.

II.5 The Ten Wholesome and Unwholesome Actions and the Primacy of Intention

In specific classifications, wholesome and unwholesome karma can be summarized in ten main courses of action. On the unwholesome side, these include: destroying life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, frivolous or idle speech, covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. Corresponding to these are the ten wholesome actions: abstaining from destroying life, abstaining from taking what is not given, abstaining from sexual misconduct, abstaining from false speech, abstaining from divisive speech, abstaining from harsh speech, abstaining from idle talk, together with non-covetousness, non-hatefulness, and right view.

Those who commit evil deeds will fall into bad destinies after death even if others pray for them to be reborn in heaven. Conversely, those who practice wholesome deeds will be born in good destinies even if others curse them to fall. This shows that karmic law is not altered by others’ prayers or rituals; it is governed by the actions themselves and the intentions behind them. The same principle applies to all professions and identities — whether foot soldiers, elephant riders, chariot warriors, or any other social role, the workings of karma do not change according to one’s occupation.

Furthermore, the outcome of actions is determined primarily by the state of mind and intention at the time of action, not by the external form of the action or the name of one’s profession. If a person engages in some occupation, but his mind is pure and his intention wholesome, he can obtain good results; if his mind is filled with greed, hatred, and delusion, then even if his outward actions appear neutral or socially acceptable, they may still be unwholesome. Thus karmic law applies universally to everyone, and the true key lies in the direction of the mind.

III. The Bad Destinies, Hell, and Erroneous Mental Paths

III.1 The Root Causes of Bad Destinies and the Suffering in Hell

In the bad destinies there is no proper practice of the Dharma, no equality in conduct, and no wholesome or meritorious karma. Beings fall into these painful destinations because they have failed to realize the Four Noble Truths. Not understanding the truths of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path, beings act in ignorance and commit all sorts of evil deeds; after death they naturally incline toward hell, the realm of hungry ghosts, the animal realm, and other bad destinies.

The retributions in hell are especially severe, and many arise from evil deeds of body, speech, and mind. For example, creating evil karma through speech and thought, or disparaging noble ones, can become causes for the sufferings of hell. Likewise, those who cling to arrogance and are steeped in “the path of conceit” will enter a drunken, crazed state; if they persist in arrogance, they will in the end fall into hell. Those who fall into hell through pride will dwell in a sorrow like a long, dark night, suffering for a very long time. Those who practice spells and magical illusions are no exception: they must bear retributions specifically corresponding to their deeds, and when their bodies break up and their lives end, they fall into bad destinies, into the very worst places, into hell.

When evil karma ripens, the torment of hell continues for a long time — many years, many hundreds of years, many thousands of years, or even many hundreds of thousands of years. Once the hellish retributions are exhausted, the remaining force of their evil karma still brings further results in other specific forms of suffering, showing the unbroken continuity of karmic consequences. Thus the statement that “all evil deeds must yield corresponding results” fully accords with the principle that karma never fails.

III.2 The Proportion of Human Rebirths to Bad Destinies in Saṃsāra

Among beings who die from the human realm, those who are reborn again as humans are as few as the dust on the tip of a fingernail; those who, upon dying from the human realm, are reborn into other destinies (including hell, the animal realm, hungry ghosts, etc.) are as numerous as the vast earth. Viewed more broadly, whether they die from the human realm, from hell, the animal realm, or the realm of hungry ghosts, those who are reborn among humans or in heavenly realms — relatively fortunate states of existence — are always few, while those who are reborn in hell, as animals, or as hungry ghosts — states that are worse or at best no better — are the overwhelming majority.

Thus, those who are reborn into better states of existence are always in the minority, and those reborn into worse or equally low states are in the majority. This shows that if one does not deliberately strive to practice goodness and cultivate the path, but simply allows oneself to be carried along by the natural momentum of karma and defilements, the trend of one’s life will almost certainly lead toward the bad destinies.

III.3 The Lack of Wholesome Conduct and the Failure to See the Four Noble Truths

In the bad destinies there is no proper practice of the Dharma, no conduct based on equality, and no implementation of wholesome or meritorious actions. Beings can only be dragged along by past evil karma and present ignorance. The fundamental cause is that they have not realized the Four Noble Truths; they do not understand how suffering arises in life, how it can be extinguished, nor do they know the path that leads to its cessation. This ignorance causes them to create abundant evil karma in this very life and to continue roaming among the painful destinies after death.

IV. Good Destinies, Moral Discipline, and the Direction of Liberation

IV.1 Wholesome Karma, Moral Discipline, and the Heavenly Realms

Those who commit evil deeds, when their bodies break up and their lives end, are certain to be reborn in painful bad destinies; those who practice wholesome actions, when their bodies break up and their lives end, will be reborn in pleasant places. This law — that wholesome and unwholesome karma determine one’s destination — will not change because of others’ prayers or rituals. If someone accomplishes three kinds of pure realization, or attains the moral discipline of noble ones, that being, when his body breaks up and his life ends, can be born in good destinies and heavenly worlds.

Wholesome karma manifests not only as outward conduct, but also as moral discipline and the vows in one’s heart. If someone who upholds precepts gives rise to a pure vow, his pure intention can fulfill that vow and attain the corresponding proper result. This shows that a pure will and aspiration themselves have powerful karmic force, able to guide the direction of future lives.

On the other hand, if someone places his ultimate reliance on beauty, wealth, relatives, or children, although these conditions can bring a measure of security and satisfaction in this world, they cannot serve as a basis at the time of death for rebirth in good destinies or heavenly realms. The true cause of good destinies is the power of moral virtue. Those who take the power of precepts and virtue as their cause can, after death, be reborn in good destinies and heavenly worlds.

IV.2 Accumulating Virtue and Securing Future Benefit

If a person truly practices good and diligently accumulates virtue, he is paving the way for the future. These merits are in fact good deeds that benefit others and genuinely help them; in later lives they also become the means by which he himself can cross the sea of birth-and-death. When beings can understand doing good in this way, they will realize that virtuous actions are not a temporary loss, but a long-term investment that benefits both others and oneself.

The practice of wholesome karma also affects with whom beings gather after death. Those with kind intentions are drawn together with groups of similarly kind beings. Those who carry out wholesome deeds will gather with others who also act wholesomely: for example, those who abstain from killing, abstain from taking what is not given, abstain from sexual misconduct, abstain from false speech, abstain from divisive speech, abstain from harsh speech, abstain from idle talk, and abstain from intoxicants will naturally gather together in the future with others who refrain from those same actions. This is not only a social phenomenon, but a concrete manifestation of karmic force drawing those of the same kind together.

V. Special Rebirths and Examples of Karmic Results

V.1 The Conditions for Rebirth as a Dragon and the Way Upward

There is a class of beings who, because in the past they committed a mixture of wholesome and unwholesome actions in body, speech, and mind, are reborn among dragons when they die. This mixed karma means they do not entirely move toward good destinies, nor do they wholly fall into bad destinies, but are born among the dragon species. When they hear that a certain kind of dragon enjoys long life, handsome appearance, and abundant pleasures, they reflect and make a wish, hoping that when they die they too can be reborn into that type of dragon community. Because they hold such an aspiration, and already possess the corresponding mixed karma of past wholesome and unwholesome actions, they can, at death, be reborn as they wish among that particular group of dragons.

Within the dragon communities, some dragons gradually come to understand that their present dragon form is precisely the result of their past wholesome and unwholesome deeds of body, speech, and mind. When they become confident that if they now practice wholesome deeds through body, speech, and mind, they may, after death, be reborn in good destinies or heavenly realms, they decide to begin practicing wholesome actions. For example, on the observance days (uposatha), they follow the teachings especially to cultivate good and uphold precepts. In this way, through present wholesome karma they can discard their current dragon bodies and move toward better states of existence.

V.2 The Karmic Law Behind Rebirth as a Golden-Winged Bird

Another case is rebirth as a golden-winged bird (a garuḍa). This likewise requires mixed karma: in past lives, wholesome and unwholesome deeds of body, speech, and mind were both present. When such beings hear that a certain kind of golden-winged bird has long life, fine appearance, and great happiness, they generate a strong wish in their hearts, hoping that at death they may be reborn in that specific group of golden-winged birds. Because the direction of their minds combines with their existing mixed karma, at the time of death they are reborn among exactly the type of golden-winged birds they aspire to join.

These examples all show that karma and aspiration work together to guide rebirth among particular groups after death. Because the quality of one’s actions and intentions differs, the beings and realms into which one is reborn likewise differ.

VI. Wrong Views and the Denial of Karma and Its Results

VI.1 The Faults of Denying Karma and Embracing Annihilationism

Some people hold nihilistic views that deny the results of wholesome and unwholesome karma. They maintain that giving and offering have no merit, deny the existence of this world and the next, and even deny the real existence of parents and sentient beings, claiming that when life ends, it is utterly annihilated. They regard the body as nothing more than a composite of the four great elements — earth, water, fire, and wind — which, after death, are merely returned to their original places. Within such a view, all morality and cause-and-effect are deemed meaningless.

Others hold the view of “no result of actions,” believing that killing, stealing, and other evil acts incur no guilt, asserting that harming others does not bring bad consequences, and that giving and maintaining precepts produce no merit. They totally deny any causal relationship between actions and their results. These erroneous doctrines contradict the true functioning of karmic law and encourage increased heedlessness, leading people to indulge in evil deeds without restraint.

At the same time, some mistaken teachings dogmatically assert that certain particular evil acts must always lead to a specific bad result, while entirely ignoring the length of time an action is practiced and the overall pattern of behavior. If one judges a person’s final outcome solely by a single evil act, without considering whether over the majority of his life he has mainly practiced wholesome or unwholesome conduct, then one cannot correctly assess the influence of karma. Doctrines of this kind are logically incomplete; they do not accord with truth and cannot properly guide beings.

VI.2 “Existence” and the Conditions for the Arising of Wrong Views

When someone regards “existence” — that is, being itself — as pleasure, joy, and happiness, and fails to truly understand the complete cessation of existence, he easily gives rise to related wrong views. These wrong views may involve clinging to eternalism, or denying cause and effect; they are all misunderstandings of the true nature of existence. Conversely, if one does not view “existence” as pleasure, joy, and happiness, and is able truly to understand the cessation of existence, then one will not generate those wrong views that are based on attachment to being. This shows that one’s attitude and understanding of “existence” are key factors determining whether one falls into erroneous views.

VII. Defilements, the Four Floods, and the Higher Fetters

VII.1 The Four Floods and the Cycle of Rebirth

Beings find it hard to put an end to birth and death because they are swept along by four powerful “floods.” These four floods are the flood of sensual desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance. The flood of desire is attachment to sensual pleasures; the flood of existence is attachment to life and modes of being; the flood of views consists of various wrong views; and the flood of ignorance is fundamental delusion and unknowing. These four forces are like torrential currents that prevent beings from dwelling in stillness, carrying them helplessly along in the currents of saṃsāra, causing the predicament of ceaseless birth-and-death.

In another formulation, these four floods are also expressed as desire, becoming, wrong views, and ignorance — four mighty streams that engulf beings, from which they find it hard to escape. Unless these four floods are cut off, the cycle of rebirth cannot be completely stilled.

VII.2 The Five Higher Fetters and Bondage to the Three Realms

In a finer classification, there are also five “higher fetters” that bind beings in the higher planes of existence. These five higher fetters are: craving for the realm of form, craving for the formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. Craving for the realm of form is attachment to existence in the form-sphere; craving for the formless realm is attachment to existence in the formless sphere; conceit is arrogance and self-importance; restlessness is inner agitation and instability; ignorance is fundamental delusion. These five fetters ensure that even beings born into high realms have not yet escaped saṃsāra.

Viewed more broadly, modes of existence are divided into three kinds: bondage to the sensual realm, bondage to the form realm, and bondage to the formless realm. In the sensual realm there are sensual seeking, the taints (āsavas) of sensuality, sensual existence, and sensual craving. In the form realm there are existence-seeking, the taints connected with existence, existence in the form realm, and craving for that existence. In the formless realm there are the seeking of Brahma-like conduct, formless existence, and the craving connected with non-material being or non-being. These diverse forms of seeking, taintedness, modes of existence, and craving together constitute beings’ clinging to all states in the three realms. When these bonds interact with the four floods, it becomes extremely difficult for life to break free from the cycle of rebirth.

VII.3 Defilements That Must Be Cut Off Through the Four Bases of Spiritual Power

On the path of practice, one must use the four bases of spiritual power and related strengths to effectively cut off these four floods and the five higher fetters. The four floods — the floods of desire, existence, views, and ignorance — must each be clearly recognized and countered; the five higher fetters — craving for form, craving for the formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance — must also be severed through the cultivation of meditation and wisdom. Only when these deep bonds are fully cut off, when ignorance is extinguished and craving is quenched, can saṃsāra truly come to an end.

VIII. The Four Realms, the Three Qualities, and the Path of Renunciation

VIII.1 The Attraction, Harm, and Transcendence of the Four Realms

Beings linger in the world because the four realms possess an attractive power that makes them crave for them; at the same time, the four realms contain dangers that bring various harms and sufferings, leading beings to feel revulsion toward them. Yet although this is so, there are also methods of transcendence within the four realms. If beings can grasp these methods, they can leave the four realms behind. However, if they do not understand the three fundamental qualities, they cannot truly attain liberation.

VIII.2 The Constitution of Birth and Death and the Three Kinds of Action in Life

In the functioning of life, the three forms of action — bodily, verbal, and mental — are the key conditions for the arising of pleasure and pain. When bodily intention is the cause, it leads to pleasures and pains related to the body; when verbal intention is the cause, it leads to pleasures and pains related to speech; when mental intention is the cause, it leads to pleasures and pains related to the mind. Thus all pleasure and pain can be traced back to the three kinds of karmic actions. When beings misuse these three forces, increasing greed, hatred, and delusion, their deeds are unwholesome; conversely, if they use body, speech, and mind to practice wholesome Dharma, their actions lead to pleasant results and good destinies.

IX. Old Karma, the Duration of Actions, and the Purification of the Mind

IX.1 The Duration of Actions and Their Influence

The influence of any action is intimately related to how long it is practiced. If a person performs wholesome deeds for a long period, and unwholesome deeds only occasionally, then overall the influence of good will be greater and that of evil smaller. Conversely, if unwholesome actions are many and wholesome actions few, the influence of evil will dominate. Therefore, a single evil act or a momentary good deed is not enough to assess fully the general direction of one’s karmic results; one must consider what kind of conduct predominates over most of one’s time.

Those doctrines that one-sidedly assert that “a certain evil act must inevitably cause a certain bad result,” without taking into account how long it is practiced or the overall structure of a person’s behavior, are illogical and cannot be regarded as right view. A correct understanding of karma must include consideration of duration, frequency, and the underlying motives of mind.

IX.2 The Dissolution of Old Karma and the Four Immeasurables

Although old karma continues to exert influence in this life and the next, past accumulations can be dissolved through inner cultivation and liberation. When someone truly cultivates and increases the mind of liberation through loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity — the four immeasurable states — he gradually purifies his inner being so that past karmic forces no longer manifest in the same way. Just as the strong blowing of a conch can make its sound heard in all directions, deep spiritual cultivation can exhaust old karma so that it leaves no remainder and no longer produces results. In this way, although past karma once existed, it no longer functions as the decisive factor determining present and future suffering.

X. The Course of Birth and Death and the Watershed of Liberation

X.1 The Rebirth of Those Not Yet Liberated

If a person has not lived the holy life, has not cut off ignorance, has not extinguished craving, and has not realized the cessation of suffering, then, when his body breaks up and his life ends, he must be reborn somewhere again. Since craving and ignorance still remain, he cannot escape from the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, but will continue to endure suffering in saṃsāra. As for those who had already freed themselves from sensual desire but again return to it, their state of life is like death; they have lost true freedom and liberation.

X.2 The Core Principle of Avoiding Evil and Escaping Suffering

In terms of avoiding evil and escaping suffering, there is one core principle that is especially important: those who commit evil find it hard to escape distress, just as birds cannot easily escape being caught. Once evil karma has been done, it becomes a bond, and in the future one must undergo the corresponding painful result. This inevitability is also likened to the relationship between sowing and reaping: just as planting a certain kind of seed leads in time to harvesting the fruit of that plant, performing wholesome actions must produce wholesome results, and performing unwholesome actions must produce unwholesome results. Whatever kind of “seed” (karmic deed) the doer plants, he must bear the corresponding kind of fruit.

When someone causes fear and terror to others, he himself will, in the future, endure unending fear. The consequences brought about by any action ultimately return to the doer. This is consistent with the earlier statement that “the results of actions inevitably come back to the actor himself”: whether wholesome or unwholesome, no fruit fails to ripen.

X.3 The Universality of Death and the Direction of Karmic Results

All beings are of the nature to die; in the end they all face the breaking up of the body and the end of life. No one can transcend death itself. The key lies in where one goes after death. Those who commit evil deeds inevitably head toward painful places; those who practice wholesome deeds move toward happy destinations. Since all of this is determined by karma, not by external powers or others’ prayers, whether one can avoid evil and suffering depends entirely upon the present orientation of one’s body, speech, and mind, and on whether one truly understands and practices the path that ends suffering.

In summary, the root of saṃsāra is craving and ignorance, and karma is the force that drives beings to revolve unceasingly in birth and death. Through the law of karmic results, wholesome and unwholesome actions form an irreversible pattern of retribution that ultimately determines where life goes and what kinds of pleasure and pain are experienced. Only by recognizing the reality of karma and its fruits, staying away from wrong views, cutting off the four floods and the five higher fetters, practicing wholesome deeds and moral discipline, and purifying old karma through the cultivation of loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, can one truly go beyond the cycle of birth and death and move toward the cessation of suffering and final liberation.
