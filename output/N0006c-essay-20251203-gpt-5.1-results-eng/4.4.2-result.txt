I. Mindfulness and Moderation in Eating

In daily life, eating is not only a necessity for sustaining the body; it is also an important aspect of spiritual practice. While eating, one should maintain continuous and clear mindfulness, letting the mind focus on the act of eating in the present moment, clearly aware of each mouthful of food entering the mouth, and of the processes of chewing and swallowing. 

At the same time, one needs a clear understanding of the amount of food being taken in—knowing what constitutes an appropriate portion, neither indulging in excess nor deliberately depriving the body. Instead, one measures and adjusts within mindfulness, allowing eating to become a support for the harmony of body and mind.

II. Letting Go of Attachment to Victory and Defeat to Be Freed from Suffering

When facing interpersonal interactions and various situations, if the mind tightly clings to victory and defeat, it often brings endless afflictions and suffering. To truly be freed from this suffering, one must thoroughly relinquish the attachment to winning and losing—no longer using victory and defeat as the standard by which everything is measured, and no longer allowing success or failure, gain or loss, to disturb the peace of the heart.

When a person is willing to completely put down the attachment to victory and defeat, their dependence on competition and comparison will gradually subside. Suffering will accordingly decrease, laying the foundation for a deeper level of inner tranquility.

III. The Calm and Happiness After Letting Go

When attachment to victory and defeat is truly abandoned, the mind will gradually move toward calm, no longer being pulled up and down by external circumstances. With such a state of mind, a person can find happiness in daily life, becoming lighter and more at ease in all activities—walking, standing, sitting, and lying down.

Because one no longer worries and frets over winning and losing, it becomes easier to lay concerns aside at the end of the day and fall peacefully asleep. Inner calm and the happiness of daily life reflect and support each other, so that nighttime sleep becomes steady and secure, and both body and mind receive genuine rest.

IV. The Awareness and Self-Control of One Who Practices Forbearance

When facing the emotions of others—especially anger—a person endowed with the virtue of forbearance will not be immediately swayed by the other’s rage. Instead, they can keenly perceive that the other person’s anger is manifesting. They do not react impulsively in response to the other’s emotional upheaval, but rather maintain inner calm and sustain clear mindfulness even in an atmosphere of anger.

What such a person displays is a power of self-control: seeing the other’s anger clearly, while also seeing their own bodily and mental state in that very moment. They keep the mind steady and refuse to “dance along” with the emotion, thereby preventing the conflict from escalating and keeping their own heart from becoming defiled.

V. Key Attitudes in Inner Cultivation

In the process of inner cultivation, there are several important points that express the correct attitude.

First, one must not let the mind be carried away by external conditions. No matter how the outer environment changes, the mind should not be easily dragged along, but should maintain a certain degree of stability and autonomy.

Second, one should strive to keep the mind pure and peaceful, so that it is not covered over by defilements and afflictions, but instead clarity and steadiness become its basic condition.

Furthermore, one must stay far from grasping and anger—not allowing greedy desires or wrathful emotions to dominate one’s actions and thoughts, thus avoiding falling into greater suffering and error.

Finally, one must continuously sustain mindfulness and clear comprehension, using lucid awareness to illuminate the present body, mind, and environment, so that one’s speech and conduct do not operate under ignorance and confusion. Together, these points form the indispensable core attitudes in inner cultivation.

VI. Daily Practice and an Unshaken Mind

On the actual path of practice, mere intellectual understanding of principles is not enough; repeated exercise and reinforcement in daily life are also necessary. Thus, one should maintain vigilance at all times, continually reminding oneself, and frequently studying and becoming familiar with the principles used to counteract afflictions. Through such alertness and learning, methods of dealing with afflictions no longer remain mere concepts, but can be applied each time a situation arises.

At the same time, whatever circumstances one encounters—especially with regard to receiving or not receiving offerings—one’s mind should remain stable and unmoved by external conditions. When offerings are given, one should not give rise to craving, excessive delight, or arrogance because of what is received. When there are no offerings, one should not feel disappointed, dissatisfied, or resentful.

Whether or not one is supported by material goods or external treatment, the mind can remain even and unshaken, meeting different situations with the same calm composure. Through such daily study and practice, mindfulness, purity, and tranquility can gradually be realized in every aspect of life.
