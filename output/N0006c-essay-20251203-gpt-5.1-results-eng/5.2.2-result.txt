<title> Principles for Guiding Beings, Standards of Transmission, and Conditions for Propagating the Tathāgata’s Teaching </title>
<article>
I. The Function of the Liberated One in Guiding Beings in Accordance with the Dharma  
I.1 The Tathāgata’s Guidance as the Dharma King Who Abides in the Dharma  
Among those who are liberated, the Tathāgata is regarded as the Dharma King who abides in the Dharma, able to guide beings in accordance with the true Dharma. He takes the Dharma as the supreme standard in leading the multitude, enabling all beings gradually to understand and recognize the content and direction of the true Dharma, so that they are not confused by wrong views. In this process of guiding beings, the Tathāgata’s mental conduct transcends all jealousy and hatred; it is unstained by any aversion, comparison, or conflict, manifesting the characteristic of a liberated one who guides beings with a mind that is pure and undefiled.

II. Observing Beings’ Capacities and Making Choices in Transmitting the Dharma  
II.1 Observing the Differing Capacities of Sentient Beings in the World  
When propagating the teaching in the world, one must first carefully observe beings’ capacities and circumstances. Upon observation, one finds that among beings, some are heavily obscured by afflictions, shrouded by all kinds of defilements; others are relatively less obscured, and their minds are comparatively clear. Some beings have sharp faculties, being keenly receptive to the meaning of the Dharma and easy to instruct; others have dull faculties, responding slowly to the teaching and finding it hard to give rise to deep understanding. Some have good qualities, with gentle temperament and upright hearts, and are easy to discipline; others have poor qualities, with coarse habits and unwholesome behavior, and are hard to subdue.

Among those who are to be taught, one also sees that some beings are easy to instruct: once directed, they gladly practice in accordance with the teaching. Others are extremely difficult to teach: even after repeated explanations, it is hard to change their stubborn views and behavior. In addition, there is yet another type of being who can foresee possible future faults, who truly feels fear and dread toward future dangers or bad results, and thus possesses the capacities of vigilance and self-reflection. These differences make up the various kinds of spiritual capacities found among beings.

II.2 Choosing How to Transmit the Dharma and Opening the Ambrosial Dharma Gate  
Precisely for this reason, when transmitting the Dharma one must not apply a single, uniform approach, but must instead make discerning choices based on careful observation of beings’ differing conditions. In the face of differences such as the degree to which beings are obscured by afflictions, whether their faculties are sharp or dull, whether their qualities are good or bad, whether they are easy or hard to guide, and whether they can give rise to fear of future faults, one must carefully determine how the teaching should be unfolded. Only on the basis of such observation and assessment does one decide to open the ambrosial Dharma gate at the appropriate time, enabling those beings who possess the conditions for hearing it to draw near to the true Dharma.

When choosing recipients for the transmission, particular emphasis is placed on beings who already possess the conditions for hearing, and who are willing genuinely to listen to and receive the true Dharma. For the sake of the correct teaching, they are able to relinquish other mistaken beliefs and views that they previously clung to. It is precisely because they are able to put down their erroneous supports that they can truly receive and benefit from the opening of the ambrosial Dharma gate.

III. The Teacher–Disciple Relationship and Standards for Dharma Lineage Transmission  
III.1 Transmitting the Dharma Lineage and Becoming an Heir-Disciple to the Dharma  
Within the Tathāgata’s teaching, the norms of the teacher–disciple relationship are especially manifest in the transmission of the Dharma lineage. If a disciple is to receive and continue the transmission of the true Dharma, he must first genuinely uphold all of the true Dharma taught by the teacher; then, in daily practice and in work of propagation, he must personally practice and promote the teacher’s teaching, so that it may continue to spread and long remain in the world.

Such practice is not limited to verbal praise; rather, in conduct, in views, and in methods of instruction, one must faithfully follow the true path demonstrated by the teacher. When a disciple truly receives and continues the transmission of the true Dharma and also earnestly practices and widely propagates the teacher’s teaching, he gradually fulfills the conditions for becoming a qualified heir-disciple of the Dharma. Only in this way can he, in the full sense, become a successor to the teacher’s Dharma lineage and take up the responsibility of continuing the Buddha’s wisdom-life.

III.2 Proper Conduct in Instructing the Bhikṣus  
Within the relationships between teacher and disciple and within the saṅgha, correct conduct in giving admonition is especially important. Toward the bhikṣus (monks) in the saṅgha, one should offer admonition in a proper manner, giving them reminders and encouragement so that they do not deviate from the path of pure brahmacarya. At the same time, one should also speak the Dharma for the bhikṣus, explaining to them the true principles of the Dharma, so that in hearing the teaching they may increase both in wisdom and in moral discipline. When admonition and Dharma teaching proceed together, they both prevent faults and lead toward the good; this is precisely the proper way of admonishing when dealing with the community of bhikṣus.

IV. The Core Characteristics of the Tathāgata’s Teaching  
IV.1 Direct Realization of Truth Without a Teacher  
The Tathāgata manifested in the world and directly realized the truth; the Dharma wheel that he set in motion is a teaching realized by himself without a teacher. That is to say, all the doctrines that the Tathāgata expounded were not heard from some other teacher, but were established through his own immediate realization of the truth. This quality of self-realization without a teacher endows the Tathāgata’s teaching in the world with a unique and fundamental authority and reliability, laying the foundation for all later transmissions of the true Dharma.

IV.2 The Great Power and Great Might of the Teaching  
The teaching proclaimed by the Tathāgata possesses great power, great might, and great potency in the world. This power is manifested not only in its ability to shatter wrong views and extinguish afflictions, but also in its profound impact and compelling influence on the minds and consciousnesses of all beings. The majesty of the Tathāgata’s teaching can be likened to the lion, king of beasts: when the lion roars once, all other animals are struck with fear and scatter in flight. Just as this simile indicates, through its great power and great might, the Tathāgata’s teaching can cause all wrong views and improper conduct to retreat without a trace, revealing its incomparable capacity to subdue body and mind and to transform through teaching.

V. The Tathāgata’s Parinirvāṇa and the Conditions for the Propagation of the Teaching  
V.1 The Timing of Parinirvāṇa and the State of Dharma Propagation  
The timing of the Tathāgata’s entry into parinirvāṇa is not decided arbitrarily, but is closely related to the extent to which the teaching has been propagated in the world. When the holy life (brahmacarya) has become affluent and honored, has expanded and spread, is widely known by many people, and is well proclaimed among humans and devas—that is, when the pure holy life has in this world reached a state of abundance and eminence, when the practice of the true Dharma has expanded and unfolded and become widely known to many, and when in both the human and heavenly realms this holy life and teaching are skillfully declared and praised—then the teaching has already been widely propagated in the world and has obtained a stable foundation.

Only when such conditions have matured does the Tathāgata choose to enter parinirvāṇa, allowing the holy life, which has already become affluent and widespread, to continue circulating and being propagated among humans and devas in accordance with the previously established transmission, the teacher–disciple relationships, and the principles of guiding beings according to the Dharma, so that the true Dharma may long remain in the world without coming to an end. This clearly shows that, with regard to the extent of the propagation of the teaching and the timing of parinirvāṇa, the Tathāgata makes a rigorous and well-considered choice.
