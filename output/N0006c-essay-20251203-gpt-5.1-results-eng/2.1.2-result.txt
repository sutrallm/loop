<article>
I. Correcting Wrong Cognition: The Fundamental Antidote to Craving

I.1 Correcting Wrong Cognition as an Antidote to Craving  
To counteract craving, one must first begin by correcting wrong cognition. A practitioner should carefully observe that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, and that nothing can remain stable and enduring. Based on such understanding, one must learn to stop generating pure, beautiful, idealized imaginings about various things, and no longer embroider and embellish external situations in one’s mind. Furthermore, one should clearly recognize that all kinds of distress are not a real self; one must not take distress as “me” or “mine.” Only within such truthful contemplation can delusion and clinging to phenomena begin to loosen, and only then can craving gradually be counteracted.

I.2 Vigilance regarding Indulgence, Gain, and Fame  
In the course of practice, one must remain highly vigilant toward mistaken life goals. One should neither envy nor pursue any form of indulgent life, but clearly discern the nature of indulgence and see that indulgence inevitably leads to various kinds of suffering. Facing gain, offerings, and fame, one must also hold a correct understanding: one has to know, as it actually is, how these situations arise and how they cease; one must know where their intoxicating allure lies, and also clearly see the misfortunes and dangers concealed within them, as well as understand the way to escape from them. If one cannot know, as it actually is, their arising, cessation, allure, danger, and escape, one will be unable to transcend their bonds and will only continue to be dragged along and entangled.

II. Dependent Origination, Life’s Dependence on “Nutriment,” and the Aggregation and Cessation of Suffering

II.1 Observing the Arising and Ceasing of Life Phenomena and “Nutriment”  
In the concrete sequence of observation and practice, a practitioner should examine all kinds of life phenomena being contemplated, and at the same time observe the conditions on which these life phenomena depend—namely, what is called “nutriment”—how it arises and how it ceases. Through observing the laws governing the arising and cessation of life and its supporting condition “nutriment,” one then puts into practice, in the mind, disillusionment, non-craving, and the ending of attachment to them. In this way, the infatuation with life and its supporting conditions will gradually diminish, and only then can the mind turn toward purity and liberation.

II.2 Contemplating the Allure and the Danger of Binding Phenomena  
Regarding all phenomena that can bind beings, a practitioner must understand their basic mode of operation. If, with respect to these “binding phenomena,” one abides in the contemplation of their allure—that is, one remains with the sweet pleasure they bring—then craving is bound to increase; because craving increases, grasping and attachment to objects also increase, and thus the entire mass of suffering is accumulated. Conversely, if with respect to these same binding phenomena one abides in contemplation of their danger—that is, one focuses on observing their faults and defects—then craving will subside; as craving subsides, grasping and attachment to objects also cease, and in this way the entire mass of suffering moves toward extinction.

The same principle can be described from another angle: regarding binding phenomena, if one abides in contemplation of their allure, one causes the mass of suffering to arise; if one abides in contemplation of their danger, one brings about the cessation of the mass of suffering. From the perspective of consciousness: if one abides in contemplation of the allure of binding phenomena, that is, delights in them with craving, then there will be the manifestation and activity of that corresponding consciousness; if one abides in contemplation of the danger, that is, focuses on observing the faults, then that kind of consciousness will not manifest. It can be seen that the mode of contemplation directly determines the accumulation or cessation of the mass of suffering, and is also a crucial key in determining whether consciousness manifests.

II.3 Concrete Observation of Allure and Danger  
In the detailed observation of the factors of dependent origination, a clear method of contemplation is required: on the one hand, one should observe the allure of phenomena—that is, the joy and satisfaction they bring; on the other hand, one must also observe their danger, seeing that behind their surface allure there are, in reality, various hidden risks and defects. Regarding any object of grasping, if the mind clings to and focuses on its allure, craving and desire will grow and become more entrenched. Conversely, if, with respect to that same object of grasping, one deliberately uses wisdom to contemplate its danger, then craving will be stilled, and infatuation and attachment to it will gradually fade.

II.4 General Application across the Factors of Dependent Origination  
This contemplation of allure and danger, and the practice of escape, is not limited to a single phenomenon; it can be widely applied to all factors of dependent origination. Starting from the most evident factor of aging-and-death, one traces back through birth, existence, grasping, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, formations, and finally to ignorance at the very root. Each of these can serve as a concrete object for practice. That is, one observes how aging-and-death produces suffering, how birth leads to aging-and-death, how existence supports birth, and how formations and ignorance serve as the starting point of the entire cycle of wandering-on. Each can be carefully examined for its allure, danger, and escape, using the same method, thereby weakening craving and attachment at every link.

II.5 Direct Insight and Proper Reflection  
In terms of cognitive method, a practitioner should not rely on faith, desire, hearsay, superficial perception of appearances, or discursive reasoning to establish an understanding of the Dhamma, but should rely solely on the direct seeing of wisdom, personally realizing the law of dependent origination. This direct-insight wisdom ensures that one does not merely accept others’ statements, but can directly experience the true state of things.

For a noble disciple who has heard the Dhamma, when he contemplates in this way with wisdom, seeing things as they really are, he will develop disenchantment toward the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—recognizing that there is nothing in them truly worth grasping. Further, he should properly reflect and repeatedly examine the whole world, asking whether there exists any phenomenon whatsoever that can be clung to without involving danger. Through such examination, he comes to know as it really is: whichever phenomenon one clings to will inevitably bring danger, without exception.

In this process, one must also clearly observe that all phenomena arising in dependence upon conditions are impermanent, conditioned, and arisen through causes and conditions. Through such right view, one can unremittingly extinguish various defilements one by one, leaving no gap for defilements to arise again.

III. General Principles of Allure, Danger, and Escape in Three Aspects

III.1 General Outline of Allure, Harmfulness, and the Way of Transcendence  
With regard to all fields of experience, there are three general essential aspects. First, whatever happiness and joy arise in any field through conditions constitute that field’s allure, or its “flavor” or sweetness; this is why beings are attracted to that field. Second, every field is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change; such impermanence and corruption are the harmfulness or danger inherent in that field. Finally, when the craving that arises with regard to any field is subdued and completely abandoned, that is the method of transcending that field, the path of escape from it.

From the perspective of the overall contemplative principle, every object of perception should be examined with wisdom in terms of its allure, its danger, and the method of liberation from it. Through continuous searching and investigation across various domains, a practitioner must discover in each its particular allure, its hidden dangers, and the counteractive means of escape. When such wise contemplation matures, one can gain a truthful understanding of the six kinds of objects—and indeed of all objects—in these three aspects. Only when one truly knows, as it actually is, the allure, the danger, and the method of escape of each object, can one be said to have completed one’s understanding of them.

III.2 The Threefold Turning of Contemplation and Its Relation to Liberation  
Regarding the five aggregates, there is a definite threefold mode of contemplation. First, one must understand the allure of the five aggregates: that is, the joy that arises dependent on them. Second, one must observe their danger: the aggregates themselves are impermanent, suffering, and inevitably subject to decay. Third, one must recognize the path of escape: namely, to subdue craving for the aggregates and thereby cut off sensual and craving-based attachment to them. As far as the aggregates are concerned, if there were no allure, beings would not become attached to them; exactly because there is allure, beings become attached. If there were no danger, beings would not become disillusioned with the aggregates; precisely because there is danger, disenchantment arises. If there were no possibility of escape, beings could not be liberated from the aggregates; because there is a way of escape, true liberation from the aggregates is possible.

Likewise, attachment to and liberation from the six sense bases and the six sense objects also depend on whether one truly understands their three aspects: allure, danger, and escape. If there were no allure, one would not develop attachment to the six sense bases and six sense objects; it is because allure exists that attachment arises. If there were no danger, one would not feel aversion or weariness toward them; it is because danger exists that one becomes disenchanted. If there were no escape, true liberation would be impossible; precisely because a way of escape exists, beings can gain freedom from the bondage of the six sense bases and six sense objects.

Moreover, a practitioner must understand that it is necessary to achieve a thorough and complete understanding of all phenomena within the relevant domain, and to cut off craving for them and relinquish attachment to them. Only thus can the threefold contemplation truly function, leading the mind toward liberation.

IV. Truthful Observation of the Five Aggregates and the Five Clung-to Aggregates

IV.1 Fully Understanding the Five Aggregates to End Suffering  
In the practice of liberation, there must be a clear method for understanding the five aggregates. A practitioner must realize the five aggregates, comprehensively knowing their nature from every aspect, and on this basis withdraw from the aggregates and cut off attachment to them; only then can suffering truly be ended. A noble disciple who has heard the Dhamma, precisely because he contemplates with wisdom in accordance with reality, develops disenchantment toward the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—and sees in them a nature not worth continuing to cling to; only then is further escape possible.

IV.2 How Allure, Danger, and Escape Operate in Relation to the Five Clung-to Aggregates  
With respect to the five clung-to aggregates, one can contemplate from the three perspectives of allure, danger, and escape. The happiness brought by the aggregates is their allure, the aspect that draws beings to develop craving and attachment to the five clung-to aggregates. The impermanence, suffering, and changing nature of the aggregates constitute their danger, revealing their untrustworthy nature and their ultimate disintegration. As for escape from the aggregates, this consists in subduing and then cutting off craving with regard to the aggregates, thereby severing the bondage of the five clung-to aggregates.

In the content of this cognitive principle, it is further explained that one must clearly know the function of the pleasure brought by the aggregates (their allure), as well as the faults and dangers hidden in the aggregates, and also understand the method of liberation from them. Only through a combined contemplation of allure, danger, and escape can one truly comprehend the whole picture of the aggregates, no longer seeing only their superficial sweetness while overlooking their deep dangers and the path of escape.

IV.3 Practicing the Abandonment of Designations and Comparisons  
In practical cultivation, one must also clearly understand the relationship between attachment and designations. All kinds of notions and labels such as “I am such-and-such” and “you are such-and-such,” along with comparative judgments, are all established on the basis of attachment to the five aggregates. If one can gradually relinquish attachment to the aggregates, one can likewise gradually eliminate these designations and comparisons grounded in the aggregates. When the aggregates are no longer regarded as “me” or “mine,” attachment to distinctions of higher and lower between self and others, and to various labels and conceptual identities, will loosen and disappear.

V. Truthful Observation of the Six Sense Bases, Six Sense Objects, and Sixfold Contact

V.1 Defining the Three Realities of the Six Sense Bases  
For the six sense bases as well, there exist three realities: allure, danger, and escape. Allure refers to the happiness and joy arising dependent on the six sense bases, which constitute their attractive aspect for beings. Danger refers to the fact that the six sense bases are inherently impermanent, suffering, and subject to decay; sooner or later they will decline and vanish. Escape is the restraint and abandonment of craving that arises with regard to the six sense bases, through which one surpasses the bondage they impose on the mind.

V.2 The Threefold Contemplation of the Six Sense Objects  
When taking the six sense objects as one’s focus, the threefold contemplation can be further elaborated. Allure refers to the pleasure, joy, and satisfaction produced by contact with the six sense objects; this is the main reason beings cling to external objects. Danger refers to the fact that the six sense objects are inherently impermanent, will ultimately lead to suffering, and are bound to decline and decay; this is the negative consequence inevitably brought by attachment to them. Escape means subduing and completely abandoning the desire and craving that arise with regard to the six sense objects; this is the only way to obtain freedom from bondage to external objects.

V.3 From Sensual Pleasures to the Path of Liberation  
In concrete practice, a practitioner should wisely examine the functioning of the six sense faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—first clearly acknowledging that they indeed can bring pleasure. Such observation does not deny the delight of sense activity; rather, it frankly recognizes that the functioning of the six senses truly has the capacity to produce joy and enjoyment. At the same time, one must wisely observe the difficulties and dangers that accompany the functioning of these sense faculties, clearly understanding that the activity of the six senses truly carries negative impacts and consequences. Finally, one must wisely examine the way to transcend the activity of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, understanding the actual method of liberation from their operations, so that the mind is no longer dragged around by them.

V.4 Steps and Completion of the Threefold Contemplation  
The overall contemplative principle points out that, when facing any object of perception, one should examine it with wisdom in terms of its allure, its danger, and the method of liberation. The actual process of observation involves continuously searching and investigating across different domains, one by one discovering their sweetness and allure, their hidden dangers, and the way to escape from them. As such wise contemplation gradually matures, one’s understanding of the three aspects of the six sense objects will become increasingly clear and truthful. Only when a practitioner truly knows, as it actually is, the nature of the allure, danger, and method of liberation of the six sense objects can he be said to have fully completed understanding in this domain.

V.5 Knowledge of the Three Aspects of the Six Sense Bases and Six Sense Objects and Liberation  
Attachment to and liberation from the six sense bases and six sense objects fundamentally depend on whether one truly understands their three aspects: allure, danger, and escape. Once these three modes of understanding are mastered, attachment to the six sense bases and six sense objects can be shaken at its root. Concretely, if there were no allure, one would not develop attachment to the six sense bases and six sense objects; it is because allure exists that attachment arises. If there were no danger, one would not become weary or disgusted with them; it is because danger exists that disenchantment is evoked. If there were no escape, true liberation would be impossible; exactly because a real method of escape exists, beings can free themselves from the bondage of the six sense bases and six sense objects.

V.6 Thorough Understanding within the Domain of the Six Sense Bases  
In the concrete application of this principle, practitioners are required to achieve thorough understanding and complete comprehension of all phenomena within the relevant domain, while at the same time cutting off craving for them and relinquishing attachment to them. Only in this way can the contemplation of allure, danger, and escape be truly implemented throughout the entire domain constituted by the six sense bases and the six sense objects, so that the mind is no longer bound by these domains.

V.7 Truthful Knowledge of Five Aspects of the Sixfold Contact  
Regarding the sixfold contact, one must fully and truthfully know the following five aspects. First, one must know how the sixfold contact arises; second, one must understand how the sixfold contact ceases and disappears; third, one must recognize the pleasures and attractions that the sixfold contact brings—that is, its allure; fourth, one must see the faults and dangers hidden within the sixfold contact—that is, its danger; finally, one must understand the method of liberation from the sixfold contact—that is, the escape.

Likewise, truthful knowledge of the six sense bases themselves also encompasses five aspects: one must understand the arising of phenomena, that is, how they come into being; understand their cessation, that is, how they pass away; know the pleasant feelings and allure they bring, which is their sweetness; know the painful feelings and dangers they involve, which constitute their danger; and understand the method of liberation from these phenomena, which is the path of escape.

VI. The Allure, Danger, and Escape with Regard to Feeling

VI.1 The Three Aspects of Feeling and Fivefold Comprehension  
In the definition and characteristics of feeling, the same three aspects—allure, danger, and escape—can be distinguished. Allure refers to the joy that arises dependent on feeling; this is the aspect of feeling that provokes craving and attachment. Danger refers to the fact that feeling is, in its very nature, impermanent, suffering, and subject to decay; sooner or later it changes and disappears—this is the fundamental danger of feeling. Escape is the restraint and abandonment of craving embedded in feeling, transcending feeling through such subduing and letting go.

In the complete content of truthful knowing, it is further stated that one must comprehend five aspects of feeling: arising, cessation, allure, danger, and escape. That is, one must not only understand how feeling arises and ceases, but also recognize its allure and attraction, understand its inherent danger and drawback, and grasp the method of escape from feeling. None of these five aspects may be omitted.

VI.2 The Temporary Benefit and Fundamental Danger of Feeling  
In truthful contemplation of feeling, one must first acknowledge that feeling does indeed have a certain temporary benefit: the joy that arises because of feeling is precisely the short-term advantage it brings. This joy is often the reason beings develop craving for feeling. Yet the nature of feeling is impermanent, suffering, and inevitably subject to decay; this constitutes its fundamental danger. When facing feeling, a practitioner must neither deny the joy it can bring, nor be deluded by that joy, but must see clearly its ultimate reality of instability and decay.

VI.3 Dual Recognition of the Craving for and the Danger in Feeling  
Regarding the nature of feeling and its antidote, further detailed observation is needed. Feeling certainly has an aspect that incites craving; people often pursue ever-new feelings because of this. At the same time, feeling also has aspects of danger and harm: these may reveal themselves in the instability and uncontrollability of feeling, and in the way it leads to various kinds of distress and continued wandering-on. Only by clearly recognizing both these aspects can one, in actual practice, avoid being deluded by temporary sweetness.

VI.4 Concrete Methods for Escaping from Feeling  
With respect to the nature of feeling and its antidote, the three aspects—allure, danger, and escape—are again emphasized. Feeling can in itself give rise to joy; this is its allure. However, feeling is also impermanent, suffering, and subject to decay; this is its danger. The method of escape from feeling is to restrain and relinquish craving toward feeling when facing it, no longer allowing oneself to be driven by the changes in feeling.

More specifically, what is meant by transcending feeling is subduing and abandoning the craving embedded in feeling. When a practitioner can completely restrain and let go of craving for feeling, then he has truly escaped from feeling.

VII. Methods of Practice: Seclusion, Non-craving, Cessation, and Letting Go

VII.1 Practicing Based on Seclusion, Non-craving, and Cessation, Directed toward Letting Go  
In terms of methods of practice, there is a mode called the “first way of practice based on three supports and directed toward one goal,” meaning that all cultivation is grounded on seclusion, on non-craving, and on cessation, and is always directed toward letting go. That is to say, in practice one must take as supports: dwelling in seclusion from defilements both in environment and in mind; departing from craving; and inclining toward cessation. Finally, all the merit and mental development achieved in practice should be directed toward relinquishment and letting go.

In cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path, this principle is likewise emphasized: one should practice with seclusion, non-craving, and cessation as foundations, and direct the whole path of practice toward relinquishment. Furthermore, all key points of the cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path are inseparable from this basic principle: one practices based on seclusion, non-craving, and cessation, and orients body and mind toward letting go. Through the implementation of this “three supports and one direction,” a practitioner gradually reduces attachment to external conditions, and the mind increasingly inclines toward peace and liberation.

VIII. The Liberating Value of Insight into Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-self

VIII.1 A Unified Mode of Contemplation: Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-self  
The key points of contemplative practice propose a unified mode of contemplation: for any object of contemplation, in the time dimensions of past, present, and future, one should follow the cognitive sequence “impermanence → suffering → non-self.” That is, first clearly see that it is impermanent; then further realize the suffering that results from impermanence; and finally recognize that it is non-self.

When recognizing non-self, one should arrive at a clear, truthful knowing expressed as: “This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.” Through such contemplation, a practitioner no longer regards any phenomenon as one’s own possession, no longer takes it as a real “I,” and no longer clings to a “self that belongs to me.” Such understanding can loosen self-centered attachment at its very root.

VIII.2 Observing Impermanence, Suffering, and Non-self in All Phenomena  
In applying this principle, a central rule is put forward: the core principles just mentioned can be universally applied to all concrete phenomena that should be contemplated and relinquished. For all such phenomena, one should truthfully contemplate their nature as impermanent, suffering, and non-self, and, on the basis of this contemplation, relinquish craving for them. That is, whether it be the five aggregates, the six sense bases, various feelings, or external objects, as long as one can clearly see that they are all impermanent, suffering, and not-self, craving for them will naturally weaken and eventually be cut off.

VIII.3 The Practical Value of Wise Contemplation  
The wise contemplation of the inner states of mind when the six sense bases meet their objects is precisely the real cause for the direct realization of liberation. When a practitioner can, with wisdom, clearly see how the mind gives rise to greed, hatred, and delusion—or to purity and non-craving—when facing objects, he has already established the fundamental conditions for liberation in actual practice. Based on this causal foundation, he can truthfully speak of the liberated state, not merely in reliance on theory or second-hand reports.

On this basis, one can also establish a personal direct knowing that does not depend on external authority, so that practice is no longer just believing others’ words, but involves confirming the truth of the Dhamma through direct observation and experience. This provides a path of practice centered on direct experience, enabling one to concretely verify the reality of these principles in one’s own life.

IX. Directly Knowing the Five Faculties and Six Sense Bases: Arising, Cessation, Allure, Danger, and Escape

IX.1 Truthful Direct Knowing of the Five Faculties and Six Sense Bases  
In the principles of direct knowing, special emphasis is placed on truthful realization of the five spiritual faculties and the six sense bases. A practitioner must truthfully know the arising and cessation of the five faculties, and must also truthfully know the allure, danger, and escape with regard to the five faculties. Likewise, one must truthfully know the arising and cessation of the six sense bases, as well as their allure, their inherent dangers, and the method of escape from them. Only when these five aspects—arising, cessation, allure, danger, and escape—are all completely clear can attachment to the five faculties and six sense bases be cut off at the root, and the path of liberation be truly fulfilled.
