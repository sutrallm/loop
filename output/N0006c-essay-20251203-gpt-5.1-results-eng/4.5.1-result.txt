<title> Rules of Speech and the Purification of Verbal Karma in the Practice of Liberation </title>
<article>
I. Fundamental Criteria for the Use and Refraining from Speech  
In the process of practicing for liberation, there are clear and rigorous requirements regarding what speech to adopt or abandon. When speaking, a practitioner should discard all content that does not qualify as wholesome speech and retain only speech that is truly wholesome. At the same time, one should not casually abandon other modes of speech apart from those that are unwholesome. In other words, only unwholesome speech is to be eliminated; all other forms of speech that meet the standard of wholesomeness are not to be rejected. These two levels of requirement both point out the need to completely put down unwholesome speech and, at the same time, caution against mistakenly abandoning wholesome speech, thus making the criteria of acceptance and rejection clear and distinct.

II. The Pervasiveness of False Speech  
When examining the act of false speech, one can see a universally applicable rule: anyone may fall into the behavior of lying. Regardless of how exalted a person’s social status may be—whether of the kṣatriya or brāhmaṇa classes, or an ordinary householder; and regardless of how abundant their wealth—whether greatly rich, possessing vast property, many assets, or abundant grain and resources—none can claim exemption on account of status or wealth. All such people may, in pursuit of sensual pleasure, knowingly speak falsehoods with deliberate intent. This shows that false speech does not appear only among the lowly or the poor; rather, it is a universally shared fault connected with the pursuit of sensual enjoyment.

III. The Self-Harm and Inverted Faults of Evil Speech  
The essence of evil speech lies first of all in its self-harming nature. Harsh and evil speech is like an axe that grows from one’s own mouth: while it appears to be used against others, in the end it turns back and harms oneself. When a person continually commits verbal misdeeds, these faults invite misfortune and prevent true wellbeing. In other words, evil speech is not merely an outward attack; it is the root that undermines one’s own destiny and happiness from within.

Beyond self-harm, evil speech is also manifested in the inversion of its objects. When facing those who ought rightly to be condemned, one instead offers praise—this is an inverted praise. Conversely, when facing those who ought to be praised, one instead condemns them—this is another form of inverted blame. Such upside-down speech not only violates reason and justice, but also reveals that the speaker’s values and judgment have been distorted, thereby further aggravating the fault of speech.

IV. The Qualities of Wholesome Speech and the Roots of Victory  
Among the many forms of speech, there is one kind that is regarded as truly wholesome. When a mode of speech possesses four distinct qualities, it can be called “well-spoken”: it is legitimate, free of fault, and not subject to criticism by the wise. Such speech combines propriety with purity: it does not violate any norm and is at the same time recognized and praised by those who possess wisdom.

From another perspective, wholesome and unwholesome speech lead to entirely different outcomes. Wholesome speech brings about victory—but this victory does not belong to the realm of violence, conflict, discord, or fierce struggle. That is, the victory attained through wholesome speech is a victory that does not depend on conflict and violence, but is achieved through harmony, understanding, and legitimacy. In contrast, evil speech belongs precisely to the realm of violence, contention, discord, and battle. It nourishes conflict and hostility and therefore can never bring about genuine victory. Even if, on the surface, one seems to overwhelm others and “win” in argument, one is merely deepening decay within violence and discord rather than gaining a complete and authentic victory.

V. Verbal Faults to Be Avoided and Expressions Not in Accord with the True Dharma  
In concrete practice, certain kinds of harmful speech must be clearly avoided. First, one should not utter words that provoke others to anger, for such speech easily arouses hatred and resentment and worsens relationships. Second, one should not utter speech that alienates people from one another; this kind of speech destroys mutual trust and harmony and sets people who could otherwise cooperate and help each other into opposition. Furthermore, all speech that is not in accord with the true Dharma should likewise be avoided: any expression that does not conform to rightful principles, deviates from the proper path, or violates the spirit of the true Dharma belongs to what should be abandoned. Only by such vigilance can speech be prevented from becoming an instrument of provocation, incitement, or violation of the law of truth.

VI. The Faults of Debate and Verbal Contest  
In discussion and instruction, there is another kind of fault that must be guarded against: engaging in contentious debate by opposing one another in terms of the quantity and superiority of speech. People should not, on the basis of speaking more or less, or having their words deemed superior or inferior, lengthy or brief, engage in debates and contests to determine who is higher or lower. Such behavior is an expression of folly and unwholesomeness; it is a transgression that subdues and suppresses the purity and diligence of practitioners. In other words, when speech is turned into a tool for showing off, competing, and vying for victory, it betrays the guiding and instructive function that speech ought to have. Practice then degenerates into self-aggrandizement and mutual attack, resulting in serious faults.

VII. The Practice of Purifying Verbal Karma  
Having comprehensively understood the standards of accepting and rejecting speech, as well as the faults of unwholesome speech, the practice of purifying verbal karma becomes an important aspect of cultivation. The concrete implementation of verbal purity is founded on a deep reflection on the feelings of self and others—that is, starting from the standpoint that “I myself do not wish to be harmed,” one refrains from harming others in the same ways, and further exhorts everyone to stay away from these faulty modes of speech.

VII.1 Refraining from Deceptive Speech  
When confronted with falsehood and deception, a practitioner first reflects that they themselves do not wish to be deceived or harmed. No one wishes to be misled by false words, nor to suffer loss because of others’ deceit. Based on this personal feeling, the practitioner resolves not to deceive others with false speech and not to subject others to the very distress they themselves would not wish to endure. At the same time, they not only personally refrain from deceptive speech, but also encourage others to refrain from lying, praising this attitude of abstention and affirming conduct that neither lies nor deceives. In this way, honesty becomes a shared standard that all agree to uphold.

VII.2 Refraining from Divisive Speech  
In observing interpersonal relationships, a practitioner reflects that they do not wish to be driven apart from others by malicious talk. No one wants to break with relatives, friends, or companions because of another’s words, nor wishes to lose trust and harmony due to someone’s instigation. Therefore, the practitioner consciously refrains from using speech to drive a wedge between people; they avoid uttering words that cause mutual suspicion, division, or opposition. At the same time, they encourage others to stay away from double-tongued, divisive speech, neither endorsing nor praising conduct that uses divisive words to destroy relationships. Instead, they praise those who are able to preserve harmony and do not stir up disputes, thereby making non-divisiveness a shared consensus within the community.

VII.3 Refraining from Harsh Speech  
When encountering coarse and venomous language, a practitioner reflects that they themselves do not wish to be addressed with abusive speech. No one is pleased to be hurt by crude, jarring, or malicious remarks, nor to live constantly within such a tone of voice. On the basis of this understanding, the practitioner does not use coarse speech to injure others; they do not employ harsh words to insult, belittle, or pierce others’ hearts. At the same time, they encourage others to jointly refrain from abusive speech, and they praise those who are able to change the habit of harsh speech, advocating gentle and respectful language as the basis for interaction. In this way, people gradually move away from the prevalence of harsh and coarse talk.

VII.4 Refraining from Idle and Impure Speech  
When faced with useless and impure talk, a practitioner reflects that they themselves do not wish to hear such idle and defiled speech. No one truly wishes to have their mind long filled with chaotic, vulgar, and unprofitable conversations, nor to waste their life on talk that brings no benefit to themselves or others. With this awareness, the practitioner does not spread disordered and unbeneficial speech; they do not use frivolous chatter merely to please others while ignoring its polluting effect on the mind, nor do they deliberately discuss filthy topics that lack any real benefit. At the same time, they encourage others to refrain from frivolous and impure speech and praise those who are able to restrain their talking and focus on meaningful content, thereby leading conversations back toward purity, propriety, and benefit.

Taken together—from the criteria for selecting speech, the universality of false speech, the self-harm and inversion of evil speech, the qualities and victorious power of wholesome speech, the verbal faults that should be avoided, the dangers of contentious debate, through to the concrete practice of purifying verbal karma—this entire system of principles points to a single core: to take kindness, honesty, harmony, and the true Dharma as the standard for all speech; to completely abandon all deceptive, divisive, harsh, and impure speech; to bring one’s verbal actions toward purity; and thereby to lay a firm foundation for the path of liberation.
