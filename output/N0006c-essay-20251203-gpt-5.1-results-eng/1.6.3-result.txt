<title> Karmic Retribution, Heavenly Realms and Bad Destinies: A Comprehensive Account from Refuge and Moral Conduct to the Destinations of Life </title>

I. Refuge, Bad Destinies, and the Basic Ground of Wholesome Karma

Anyone who takes refuge in the Buddha will, in the course of saṃsāric existence, not fall into the various bad destinies. When such a person abandons the present human life, they will be born in a heavenly realm and dwell in the assembly of the devas, becoming one who contributes to the fullness of that heavenly gathering. Seen from another angle, leaving danger behind and not turning back is itself a reminder regarding bad destinies. There is a simile that says: if someone escapes from a perilous situation—such as from blazing flames, from hell, or from a burning house—then they should not return to those dangerous places. This simile is used to indicate that, for states of suffering and paths of evil that one has already left behind, one should not repeat them again.

While one avoids falling into bad destinies, there is also a clearly stated set of wholesome karmic principles related to rebirth in the heavens, explaining what actions lead to good results in heavenly realms. Here seven kinds of wholesome karma that can bring about heavenly rebirth are enumerated. 

First, to be filial and support one’s parents throughout one’s entire life, always holding an attitude of respect and offering to one’s parents, never becoming lax from beginning to end.  

Second, to respect the elders in one’s family throughout one’s life, always maintaining reverence and courteous treatment toward the senior members of the family, never changing in this regard.  

Third, to speak gently throughout one’s life, so that over the whole of one’s lifetime one’s speech is always mild and harmonious, never harsh.  

Fourth, not to slander others throughout one’s life, never using words to defame others’ reputation.  

Fifth, to keep one’s mind free from stinginess throughout one’s life, taking joy in giving, not being miserly with one’s possessions, and willingly giving them to others.  

Sixth, to speak truthfully throughout one’s life, not uttering false words, but spending one’s life using truthful speech.  

Seventh, to be free from hatred in one’s heart throughout one’s life; or, if anger does arise, to be able quickly to subdue it, not allowing anger to remain long in the mind.  

These seven wholesome actions are all regarded as causal practices that can bring about birth in heavenly realms.

In addition, concerning the motivation for practice, there is a particular kind of situation that is listed as an obstruction, namely the state referred to as “being taken by non-humans.” This term is used for a case where a person undertakes spiritual practice with the aim of obtaining rebirth as a deva. That is, if the motive for practice is merely to become a heavenly being in the future, and not for higher and ultimate liberation, such an orientation itself is included among the obstacles.

II. The Dark and Bright Starting- and End-Points of a Life, and the Temporal Structure of Lifespans in Hell

A human life’s starting-point and end-point in the world are described as combinations of two kinds of states: dark and bright. A “dark starting-point” means that a person is born into a poor and lowly family, with a very difficult life, extremely lacking in material resources, and possibly even accompanied from birth by physical disability. In contrast, a “bright starting-point” is to be born into a rich and noble family, with an easy life, abundant material resources, an upright appearance, and good worldly conditions from the very beginning. As for the end-point of life, a “dark end-point” means that, after the body breaks up and life ends, one falls into a realm of suffering; a “bright end-point” means that after death one is born in a realm of ease and happiness. Thus, a person’s lifetime may display various trajectories of bright and dark interweaving: from darkness to darkness, from darkness turning to brightness, from brightness ending in darkness, or from brightness returning to brightness. These combinations show the differing correspondences between starting-points and end-points.

When life moves toward the bad destinies, the time spent and lifespan undergoing suffering in hell are depicted as extremely long, beyond ordinary imagination. It is said that the painful retribution experienced in hell may last for a hundred thousand “gai” years, or as long as thirty-six “gai” years, or even up to five “zi” years—such unimaginably vast periods of time used to represent the inconceivability of suffering in hell.

In order to give a figurative sense of such lifespans, a way of “calculating” the lifespan in hell is proposed. In this simile, one takes as a basis a volume of vegetable seeds equal to twenty “kali” within the borders of the kingdom of Kosala. Suppose that every hundred years a single seed is taken away—one seed every hundred years. After an inconceivably long time, when all the seeds have finally been taken, even then this process still cannot exhaust the lifespan of the most basic hell. That is, even using such an exaggerated and enormous accumulation of time as a simile is still insufficient to cover the full length of a hellish lifespan.

Furthermore, hell itself has a progressive hierarchy of levels. The lifespans of each level of hell increase stepwise by a factor of twenty. In sequence, starting from the Afuṭa Hell, then progressing upward to the Nilofuṭa Hell, then to the Apopo Hell, the Azhazha Hell, the Ahehe Hell, the Water-Lotus Hell, the Blue-Sleeping-Lotus Hell, the Blue-Lotus Hell, the White-Lotus Hell, and finally the Red-Lotus Hell—each higher level of hell has a lifespan twenty times longer than the one below it. Thus from the initial basic hell lifespan up to the highest Red-Lotus Hell, the duration multiplies layer by layer, making the suffering undergone in these hells ever more prolonged and without end.

In addition, there is a general law of unwholesome karma which states that if someone has committed the ten kinds of unwholesome actions, then when the body breaks up and life ends, they will inevitably fall into a bad destiny, into an extreme place of downfall and into hell. In other words, the karmic result of these ten unwholesome actions must lead to the various evil paths, without exception.

III. Evil Conduct, “Stealing the Dharma to Go Forth,” and Concrete Forms of Suffering as Karmic Retribution

Among various unwholesome actions, there is one called “going forth by stealing the Dharma” whose consequences are particularly emphasized. The karmic result produced by this kind of act is more serious than all the punishments of the world; the suffering and severe retribution it brings surpass the pain that worldly laws and punishments can inflict. Such a karmic result may even cause the perpetrator of this evil deed to fall into hell and undergo intense suffering.

As for the painful results produced by different unwholesome karmas, the scriptures give very detailed descriptions of their concrete manifestations. For example, there is a category of karmic retribution in which sentient beings must long endure the pain of their bodies being continually injured. Within this category, some forms appear as a “collarbone form,” where their bones are pecked apart by birds and scattered everywhere; some appear as a “meat-slice form,” where birds pursue them, pecking at their bodies as if tearing them into slices; some appear as a “meat-chunk form,” where their bodies are pecked into pieces; and there is the “skinless form,” where the body loses all its skin, leaving only blood and flesh exposed, which then continue to be tortured by pecking.

Another category of karmic retribution is associated with various weapons, producing a kind of “weapon backlash” suffering. One form is called the “blade-leaves-like-hairs form,” meaning that the whole body is pierced by countless knife-blades like leaves; another is the “blades-like-hairs form,” where the body is penetrated by innumerable blades; then the “arrows-like-hairs form,” in which the entire body is shot through with countless arrows; and the “needles-like-hairs form,” where the whole body is pierced through by innumerable needles. These meticulous depictions show that the harm caused by weapons will return upon oneself in retribution, as densely as one’s own body hair.

There are also karmic results that display particularly distinctive kinds of pain. For example, the “needle-penetration form” means that needles ceaselessly pass in and out through multiple parts of the body, making the body endure repeated piercing. Another is the “swollen-testicles form,” in which the testicles become abnormally enlarged, making movement difficult, and in this unbearable state, one still has to endure the torment of birds coming to peck at them.

These highly concrete forms of karmic retribution are also clearly correlated with particular kinds of work and responsibilities. Among the sources of unwholesome karma, one category consists of occupations that directly harm life, such as cattle butchers, bird catchers, sheep butchers, pig butchers, and hunters. Since these occupations take the lives of sentient beings as the core of their daily work, the karmic results they draw are classified under the karma of killing. 

Secondly, there is a category of occupations that fail in their social responsibilities, such as judges who make unjust decisions, those who hold the role of “regulator” (tiao-shi; the original text does not further explain this office, so its title is merely retained), as well as spies who behave improperly and magistrates who judge corruptly. Because such people abuse their power, neglect their duties or act dishonestly, they too create particular unwholesome karmas.

In terms of the correspondence of karmic retribution, the killing-type unwholesome actions correspond to those karmic results in which the body is pecked apart and dismembered; the weapon-type unwholesome actions correspond to painful retributions of being pierced by weapons; and the abuse of authority and dereliction of duty correspond to sufferings in special body parts and various forms of piercing. In this way, the different kinds of evil deeds will, in their future results, each display patterns of suffering that match the nature of the original actions.

Furthermore, among the various concrete examples of unwholesome karma, there are even more specific descriptions. For instance, some unjust people will, in retribution, sink into pits of excrement and suffer, being surrounded by filth. If someone has insulted the Saṅgha by means of excrement—such as giving excrement to monks as “food”—their result is that they themselves will in the future have to eat excrement, receiving in return the “fruit of getting to eat excrement” that matches their act. 

If someone has committed sexual misconduct, especially adultery with another man’s wife, they will experience the suffering of being flayed: the skin of their body will be stripped off, and they will suffer birds coming to peck at their flesh. If one has lived by wrong livelihood, such as a fortune-telling woman supporting herself by improper means, her result will be that her body becomes ugly and she emits a foul stench. If one has harmed others with burning coals—for instance, throwing someone into a bed of coals to be burned—one will oneself undergo the suffering of being scorched by burning coals.

In the area of judicial wrongdoing, there are also specific retributions. For example, if a jailer enforces punishments unjustly, in the future he will undergo a “headless body” form of retribution: he has a body but no head, while his eyes and mouth grow on his chest, and in this bizarre and painful condition he endures his karma.

As for those who go forth and then break the precepts, they too are clearly blamed and their retributions described. This includes bad monks, bad nuns, as well as śikṣamāṇās, novice monks and novice nuns: if, while in the monastic state, they break the precepts and commit evil acts, they will suffer a torment in which their robes, bowls, belts and even their own bodies all ignite in flames. These requisites and their bodies themselves become sources of fire, making them endure extreme agony in the blazing flames.

IV. The Classes of the Gandharva and Cloud Heavens, Conditions for Rebirth There, and Their Relation to Natural Phenomena

Within the classification of heavenly realms, there is one group of realms called the Gandharva Heavens, characterized by dwelling in dependence upon various fragrances. These heavens are further subdivided into many different types, distinguished according to which kinds of fragrance the heavenly beings rely on. 

First, there is the heaven that dwells depending on root-fragrances, relying on the scents of aromatic roots and plants. Second is the heaven that dwells depending on heart-of-tree fragrances, relying on the scents from the inner heartwood of trees. Third is the heaven that dwells depending on tree-bark fragrances, relying on the scent of the outer bark of trees. Fourth is the heaven dwelling on the fragrances of the tree’s outer surface (tree-skin) itself. Fifth is the heaven that dwells depending on bud-fragrances, taking the fresh scent of buds as its support. 

In addition, there is the heaven that dwells depending on leaf-fragrances, living amidst the clean scents exuded by leaves; the heaven that dwells depending on flower-fragrances, abiding in the scents of various blossoms; the heaven that dwells depending on fruit-fragrances, using the fragrance of ripe fruit as its basis; the heaven that dwells depending on liquid-fragrances, relying on various fragrant liquids and juices; and finally the heaven that dwells depending on “fragrance-of-fragrances,” which relies on the combined, overall aroma of all fragrances. These ten Gandharva heavens each depend on different categories of scent, forming a heavenly system whose fundamental characteristic is fragrance.

To be reborn in a Gandharva heaven, several necessary conditions must be fulfilled. First, one must perform wholesome bodily actions, making one’s physical behavior upright and good. Second, one must perform wholesome verbal actions, so that the speech that comes from one’s mouth is all good and wholesome. At the same time one must perform wholesome mental actions, keeping one’s thoughts pure and inclined toward goodness. 

In addition, one must have heard that the Gandharva heavens possess longevity, dignified appearance and abundant happiness, being aware that these heavens are characterized by long life, physical beauty and rich bliss. After understanding these characteristics, one gives rise to reflection in one’s heart and makes the aspiration: “May I, when this body breaks up and my life ends, be reborn among the host of Gandharva devas.” This combination of wholesome actions and aspirational resolve constitutes the core principle for being reborn in the Gandharva heavens.

Another category of heavens is called the Cloud Heavens, referring to realms where a class of heavenly beings dwell, and they can be broadly divided into five kinds. First is the Cold-Cloud Heaven, corresponding to phenomena of cold; second is the Hot-Cloud Heaven, corresponding to phenomena of heat; third is the Dark-Cloud Heaven, related to dim and overcast sky conditions; fourth is the Wind-Cloud Heaven, associated with the arising of wind; and fifth is the Rain-Cloud Heaven, corresponding to the occurrence of rain. These five kinds of Cloud Heavens form a set of heavenly classifications closely linked to climatic changes.

The beings in the Cloud Heavens are also said to have clear correlations with natural phenomena. When the deities of the Cold-Cloud Heaven follow the wishes in their minds, cold weather appears in the world; likewise, when the deities of the Hot-Cloud Heaven follow their wishes, hot weather appears. When the deities of the Dark-Cloud Heaven act according to their wishes, the sky becomes dark and sunlight is hard to see. When the deities of the Wind-Cloud Heaven act according to their wishes, winds arise and windy weather appears. When the deities of the Rain-Cloud Heaven follow their wishes, the clouds release rainwater and it begins to rain. In this way, the intentions of the beings in these five Cloud Heavens each correspond respectively to the five natural phenomena of cold, heat, darkness, wind and rain.

In addition, there is a saying related to the heavenly realms that mentions the wheel-turning king, the most powerful ruler in the world. Such a wheel-turning king can rule over the four continents, exercising his majesty and virtue to govern in all directions. After his death, he too may be reborn in a heavenly realm and there enjoy the pleasures of the five senses, receiving all the heavenly sensory joys of sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touches. However, even with such vast worldly merit and sovereign accomplishment, he still cannot by these alone be liberated from the four evil destinies—hell, the animal realm, the realm of hungry ghosts, and all other bad births, evil destinies and places of downfall. In other words, even if one has been a wheel-turning king ruling the four continents and has been reborn in heaven to enjoy pleasures, this by itself cannot guarantee that one will never again fall into the various bad destinies.

V. Clinging to Sense Objects, Wrong Views, and Evil Thoughts and the Destinations They Lead To

Concerning the relationship between mental activity and sensory objects, there is a principle that one should not cling to appearances. If a person’s consciousness abides in the savor of forms, or abides in the pleasant sensations that accompany those forms, lingering over and unwilling to part from these forms and pleasant feelings, then in the next life this person is likely to fall into one of two states of existence: either into hell or into the animal realm. Thus, clinging to appearances and the pleasures of the senses is itself connected to the direction of the bad destinies.

From the standpoint of basic karmic law, wrong view is shown to be a very serious fault. If someone mis-takes actions that are clearly evil as being good, or wrongly believes that such evil actions can lead to good results, this mistaken understanding is wrong view. One who holds wrong views, after the body breaks up and life ends, will be reborn only in one of two destinies—hell or the animal realm—and has no other destination. The content of these wrong views is also specified. For instance, some people mistakenly believe that merely by putting on performances to entertain the public they will, after death, be reborn in a heaven where they will have laughing, joyful devas as companions, living among deities who are always laughing. Such a notion—that entertaining performances are themselves a direct cause of heavenly rebirth—is explicitly pointed out as one type of wrong view.

Another content associated with wrong view is related to war. A statement about karmic result explains that if one believes that warriors who fight bravely on the battlefield and are killed in combat will thereby be reborn in a heaven of enjoyment, this belief too is regarded as a wrong view. Because those who hold this wrong view, when their lives end, will likewise only be reborn into the painful destinies of hell or the animal realm, and will not be reborn in a happy heaven as they wish.

Besides mistaken views, evil intentions in the mind are also said to lead to bad results. If a person’s thoughts are base, frequently harboring the intent to harm others, considering how to bring about others’ defeat, how to get others bound or imprisoned, how to have them killed or destroyed, and then dies while carrying such malicious thoughts, then after death this person will be reborn in a realm filled with suffering. Thus, a base and malicious mind is directly linked to the place of suffering that one will reach in the future.

VI. The Overall Relationship between Bad Destinies, Evil Paths, and Non-Liberation

Bringing together the foregoing discussions of unwholesome karma, wrong views, evil intentions and clinging to the pleasures of appearances, one sees multiple causes of bad destinies and evil paths intertwining with one another. Those who commit the ten kinds of unwholesome actions will, when their bodies break up and their lives end, certainly fall into bad destinies, into the extreme places of downfall and into hell. If they hold wrong views, taking evil deeds as good deeds, or believing that entertaining performances or dying in battle can directly bring about enjoyment in the heavenly realms, then in the next life they will only enter the hell realm or the animal realm. If their consciousness abides long in forms and the pleasures of the senses, or if they harbor base intentions, plotting how to harm others, then after death they too will be reborn in realms filled with suffering.

Conversely, if one can take refuge in the Buddha, one will not fall into the bad destinies but, after death, can be born in heavenly realms and dwell in harmony with the assemblies of devas. If one performs wholesome actions in body, speech and mind, has heard of the long life, dignified appearance and abundant joy of the Gandharva heavens, and in one’s heart makes the aspiration to be reborn among the Gandharva devas after the body breaks up and life ends, one can in accordance with this draw the specific karmic result of such a heavenly rebirth. Lifelong filial support of one’s parents, respect for elders in one’s family, gentle speech, refraining from slandering others, a mind free from stinginess and joyful in giving, truthful speech, and being without hatred or quickly subduing anger—these seven wholesome karmas are each listed as right causes for rebirth in the heavens.

Yet even a wheel-turning king who rules the four continents and, after death, is reborn in heaven to enjoy the pleasures of the five senses, still cannot, by such worldly achievements and merit, completely be free from hell, the animal realm, the realm of hungry ghosts, and all other bad births, evil destinies and places of downfall. Thus, in this overall description, the relationships among taking refuge, wholesome karma, heavenly rebirth, wrong views, evil intentions and unwholesome karma are all concretely presented: wholesome conduct and right aspiration lead toward heavenly realms and freedom from falling into bad destinies, whereas evil conduct, wrong views, clinging and evil thoughts lead to such suffering realms as hell and the animal realm, together with extremely long and hard-to-endure retributions of pain.
