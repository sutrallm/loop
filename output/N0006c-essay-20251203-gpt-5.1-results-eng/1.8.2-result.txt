<title> The Profound Meaning of the Dhamma and Dependent Origination as the Middle Way — The Inconceivability of the Tathāgata and the Abandoning of Extreme Views </title>
<article>
I. The Profound Nature of the Dhamma and Its Immeasurable Domain  

I.1 The Hard-to-See, Hard-to-Realize Character of the Dhamma  
The Dhamma itself is extremely profound and peaceful; it is very deep, hard to see, and hard to realize, possessing a subtle and unfathomable character. It transcends the range that ordinary thinking and conceptual speculation can reach. It does not belong to a domain that ordinary people can grasp merely through discursive thought and discrimination. It can only be directly realized and known-as-it-really-is by noble ones who truly possess wisdom and virtue.  

I.2 Immeasurable Objects and Mistaken Ways of Knowing  
Within the field of cognition, there truly exists a class of objects that cannot be known or distinguished through measuring, calculating, or comparing; these objects, in their very nature, belong to the category of the immeasurable.  

If, with regard to such immeasurable phenomena, one still insists on using methods of measuring, weighing, and calculating in order to understand and distinguish them, this in itself is a sign of a lack of wisdom, because such methods are wholly incongruent with the nature of the objects in question.  

To forcibly impose measurement and discrimination on what is intrinsically immeasurable directly results in cognitive confusion and delusion. Whatever belongs to the category of the immeasurable—no matter which specific type of immeasurable it may be—cannot be measured or calculated. Nevertheless, among one type of immeasurable and another type of immeasurable there are still differences that can be discerned.  

The wise are able to make correct distinctions between one immeasurable and another immeasurable, even though both lie beyond the realm of measurement and calculation. The foolish, however, cannot correctly distinguish them, and thus fall into confusion and bewilderment with regard to the immeasurable domain.  

II. The Manifestation of Wrong Views and Clarifying the Law of Dependent Origination  

II.1 Brahmā’s Wrong View and the Buddha’s Educational Display  
Once there was a Brahmā who held a wrong view. He considered the Brahmā realm in which he resided to be extremely supreme and exalted, and therefore imagined that no samaṇa (ascetic) or brāhmaṇa could ever reach his Brahmā realm.  

He believed that no practitioner whatsoever could attain to that realm. This way of thinking shows that he did not understand the capacities of practitioners, nor the vast power of the Dhamma. Later, he personally witnessed the display of supernormal powers; when he actually saw a samaṇa reach the Brahmā realm by means of such powers, he admitted that his previous view had been entirely mistaken, and he stated that he no longer held that earlier view that “no one can reach the Brahmā realm.”  

II.2 Wrong Doctrines Concerning Suffering and Its Cause  
Regarding the question “From where does suffering arise?”, there exist many mistaken views in the world. Some claim that “suffering is self-made,” holding that all suffering is solely produced by oneself. Others claim that “suffering is made by others,” holding that all suffering is entirely produced by others or by external forces. Still others assert that “suffering is made by both self and others,” attributing the cause jointly to oneself and others. There are even those who maintain that “suffering is neither self-made nor other-made; it arises without a cause,” regarding suffering as something that appears out of thin air. None of these doctrines constitutes a correct view of suffering.  

In truth, pleasure and pain, as phenomena intimately experienced by sentient beings, are not merely illusory fabrications; they are very real experiences. However, they are not simply produced by oneself alone, nor by others alone, nor by both self and others together, nor do they arise in a complete absence of conditions and causes.  

Among the many doctrines concerning the causes of suffering, some people, while still employing the terms “self-made, other-made, made by both self and others, neither self-made nor other-made, arisen without a cause,” at the same time acknowledge that “suffering arises dependent on contact.” That is, they acknowledge that the experience of suffering arises dependent on the arising of contact (phassa). Such a statement at least partially accords with fact.  

Conversely, if a doctrine on the one hand still declares that suffering is self-made, other-made, made by both, or arises without a cause, yet on the other hand insists that the experience of suffering “does not arise dependent on contact,” denying that suffering must arise dependent on contact, then that doctrine completely contradicts reality and falls into sheer error. This shows that its proponents do not see the truth of suffering as it really is.  

II.3 The Law of Dependent Origination and the Denial of the Four Modes of Arising  
Although pleasure and pain are truly existent experiences, their arising follows a law of causes and conditions. From the ultimate perspective of this law, no phenomenon whatsoever is “self-produced,” nor is any phenomenon “produced by another,” nor “produced by both self and other,” nor does any phenomenon “arise without cause” in the total absence of conditions.  

This stance—which negates these four wrong claims of arising—is precisely the fundamental principle of dependent origination. It points out that the arising of all phenomena necessarily depends on causes and conditions, and cannot be reduced to a single self-author, a single other-author, a joint author, or a causeless product.  

With regard to suffering and experiences of pleasure and pain, they likewise follow this principle: their arising is neither solely due to one’s own doing, nor wholly determined by others, nor a joint product of both, nor something that emerges inexplicably. Rather, they appear dependent on various conditions and on the arising of contact.  

III. Cognitive Transformation Through Seeing Dependent Origination and the Abandoning of the Two Extreme Views  

III.1 The Cognitive Shift Beyond Doubts about Self in the Three Times  
When a noble disciple, with right wisdom, sees dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda) and the phenomena that arise dependent on conditions, as they really are and in a skillful way, all his doubts concerning life across the three times naturally disappear.  

Such a disciple will no longer brood over the past, speculating about questions such as “Did I exist in the past or not? How did I exist in the past? In what manner did I exist then?” Nor will he let his thoughts gallop into the future, wondering “Will I exist in the future or not? How will I exist in the future? In what manner will I exist then?”  

At the same time, in the present life he will no longer be perplexed by questions such as “Do I exist or not? In what way do I exist? Where exactly do beings come from and where do they go?”  

By knowing dependent origination and dependent arising as they really are, he has gone beyond all conjecture and confusion regarding the status of “self” in the past, future, and present.  

III.2 The Four Comprehensive Worldly Views and Two Extremes  
Regarding the overall nature of existence, four comprehensive types of views are commonly found in the world.  

The first view claims that “everything exists,” holding that all phenomena without exception truly and substantially exist.  
The second view claims that “nothing exists,” holding that all phenomena ultimately do not exist at all.  
The third view claims that “everything is one,” reducing all existence to a single entity or principle.  
The fourth view claims that “everything is distinct,” maintaining that all things are utterly separate from one another and mutually unrelated.  

Among these four worldly views, the positions that “everything is” and “everything is not” constitute the two most common and most extreme standpoints. They are called the two extremist views and should be kept at a distance, not clung to.  

In everyday thinking and discussion, most people tend to regard the world and life through one of these two extremes of “being” or “non-being.” Some cling firmly to “everything exists” as if it were the final truth; others tenaciously hold “everything is non-existent” as the ultimate principle. In fact, neither of these is right view; both become obstacles to knowing the truth and prevent one from understanding the reality of all phenomena as they are.  

Furthermore, if we classify views more broadly, many doctrines in the world may be grouped into a few main types.  

The first group consists of views concerning the nature of the world, such as claims that the world is permanent and unchanging, or impermanent and ever-changing; that the world is finite and bounded, or infinite and boundless.  

The second group consists of views concerning the relationship between “life” (or soul) and the body. Some hold that life and body are essentially one and the same; others hold that they are different and can be separated.  

The third group consists of views concerning the post-mortem status of the Tathāgata: some say that after death the Tathāgata still exists; others say that after death the Tathāgata no longer exists; still others maintain that after death the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist; or that after death the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.  

These views constitute the main arenas of worldly disputation, and many of them are tied to attachments to one or the other of the two extremes.  

III.3 Right View that Transcends “Existence-View” and “Non-Existence-View”  
In establishing a view conducive to liberation, one must learn to transcend attachment to both “existence” and “non-existence.”  

Not clinging to “existence-view” means not stubbornly insisting that everything must truly exist, unchanging and undying. Not clinging to “non-existence-view” means not falling into the extreme denial that nothing at all exists.  

Within right view one does not side with “everything exists,” nor fall into the opposite side of “everything does not exist.” Instead, grounded in a direct observation of causes and conditions and of arising and ceasing, one abandons these two extremes. Only in this way can one gradually approach a correct understanding of the truth.  

IV. The Non-Findability of the Tathāgata and the Five Aggregates, and the Refutation of Annihilationism  

IV.1 The Law Governing the Relationship Between the Tathāgata and the Five Aggregates  
Concerning the Tathāgata—that is, the state of the Buddha or of any fully liberated one—and the relationship to the five aggregates, a clear distinction must be made. One must not think that the Tathāgata is identical with any one of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness. Nor may one think that the Tathāgata is simply the totality or sum of these five aggregates taken together. The Tathāgata is neither the same as a single aggregate, nor the same as the entire heap of all five.  

Likewise, one must not think that the Tathāgata exists “within” the five aggregates, as if the aggregates were a container and the Tathāgata, as a real entity, were placed inside. Nor may one think that the Tathāgata exists “outside” the five aggregates, as though the aggregates were here while the Tathāgata were over there, the two standing apart from one another.  

At the same time, the Tathāgata is not a separate, independent entity entirely devoid of form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. One cannot imagine the Tathāgata as some sort of existent that is wholly disconnected from the five aggregates and yet somehow self-subsistent.  

Therefore, in the present reality, with regard to the liberated state that is called “the Tathāgata,” there is no way to grasp it or define it in any form whatsoever. Since the Tathāgata is neither identical with the aggregates nor apart from them as something else; neither within the aggregates nor outside them, and not some entity that exists without aggregates at all—every attempt to cling to, seize, or fix the Tathāgata conceptually ultimately fails to hold.  

IV.2 The Tathāgata’s State Beyond the Aggregates and the Fourfold Logical Scheme  
The Tathāgata is called the supremely excellent person, who has realized the utmost, unsurpassed state. In this state, the Tathāgata neither posits nor adopts any of the four propositions: “after death he exists,” “after death he does not exist,” “after death he both exists and does not exist,” or “after death he neither exists nor does not exist.”  

Even in regard to the here-and-now, within conventional terms of “real existence,” there is no Tathāgata that can be found, grasped, or defined. From the ultimate standpoint, the Tathāgata is without form, without feeling, without perception, without formations, and without consciousness—he has gone beyond all seeking and defining that is based on form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness.  

Thus, the Tathāgata cannot be seen in any way, nor can the truth of the Tathāgata be captured in any conceptual formulation.  

IV.3 Refuting the Wrong View that the Liberated One Is Annihilated at Death  
Among some wrong doctrines there circulates the claim that one whose defilements are exhausted and who has attained liberation is utterly annihilated when life ends, never to exist again—as if liberation were simply total disappearance.  

Such a claim is in fact a misunderstanding of the teaching, because liberation is not annihilation into sheer nothingness. It cannot correctly be described in the annihilationist language of “when life is over, everything is finished.”  

To regard the liberated one’s post-mortem state as mere annihilation is to mistake the liberated state for an extreme “nothingness,” and this does not accord with the doctrine of liberation as taught in the true Dhamma.  

V. The Four Propositions Concerning the Tathāgata After Death and the Reasons for Their Non-Declaration  

V.1 Four Extreme Views and the Various Doctrines About the Tathāgata After Death  
Concerning the Tathāgata’s state after death, people in the world and various theorists have put forward four main doctrines:  

1) that after death the Tathāgata still exists;  
2) that after death the Tathāgata no longer exists;  
3) that after death the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist;  
4) that after death the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.  

Some people build their own extreme views on the basis of these four doctrines, treat them as fixed and unshakable, and thus form four kinds of extreme views.  

Because of clinging to the five aggregates and failing to abandon that clinging, some people further generate a special view that after death the Tathāgata is “neither existent nor non-existent.” This is also one special case among the four propositions. All such positions that say “after death the Tathāgata exists, does not exist, both exists and does not exist, neither exists nor does not exist” are extreme views that revolve around the issue of the Tathāgata’s post-mortem state.  

V.2 Positions Neither Accepted nor Declared  
The claim that “after death the Tathāgata is an existent” is not accepted. Likewise, the claim that “after death the Tathāgata is a non-existent” is not accepted. As for the assertion that “after death the Tathāgata is both existent and non-existent,” that too is not accepted; nor is the statement that “after death the Tathāgata is neither existent nor non-existent” accepted. In other words, none of these four claims about the Tathāgata’s state after death is affirmed.  

Beyond not being accepted, they are also “not declared.” The statement “after death the Tathāgata exists” is not declared; the statement “after death the Tathāgata does not exist” is not declared; the statement “after death the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist” is not declared; and the statement “after death the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist” is likewise not declared.  

Any doctrine that takes one of these four forms—“after death the Tathāgata exists; after death the Tathāgata does not exist; after death the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist; after death the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist”—belongs to the domain of what is not declared.  

The Tathāgata’s state after death cannot be appropriately described in any of these four ways; nor can the Tathāgata himself be correctly described in such terms. Therefore, all these descriptive forms are inapplicable to the post-mortem state of the Tathāgata.  

There are fundamental reasons why these doctrines are neither accepted nor declared. First, speculations as to whether, after death, the Tathāgata exists, does not exist, both exists and does not exist, or neither exists nor does not exist do not contribute in any way to one’s true welfare. Second, they are of no benefit to a life of pure practice and cannot guide one in leading a purified, holy life. Third, they do not help practitioners to develop dispassion toward the world, nor do they lead to the cessation of sensual desire; they do not aid in the eradication of defilements, do not bring inner peace, and cannot result in sublime wisdom, awakening, or the realization of Nibbāna.  

Therefore, from the perspective of practice and liberation, these topics and positions neither correspond to the true meaning of the Dhamma nor bear any relation to the fundamental aim of the holy life; they are not worth clinging to and should not be asserted.  

V.3 The Tathāgata’s Abandoning of the Aggregates and the Conditions for the Arising and Ceasing of the Four Views  
There is yet a deeper doctrinal reason for the non-declaration. The Tathāgata has completely abandoned form, cut it off at the root, so that form no longer arises. He has completely abandoned feeling, cut it off at the root, so that feeling no longer arises. He has completely abandoned perception, cut it off at the root, so that perception no longer arises. He has completely abandoned formations, cut them off at the root, so that formations no longer arise. He has completely abandoned consciousness, cut it off at the root, so that consciousness no longer arises.  

Since the Tathāgata has entirely abandoned form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, cutting them off at the root so that they never arise again, his state no longer falls within the domain in which the five aggregates operate.  

Moreover, the Tathāgata is free from being “measured” by form; he is deep, unfathomable, and immeasurable. He is free from being “measured” by feeling; he is likewise deep, unfathomable, and immeasurable. He is free from being “measured” by perception; again, deep, unfathomable, and immeasurable. He is free from being “measured” by formations; equally deep, unfathomable, and immeasurable. He is free from being “measured” by consciousness; also deep, unfathomable, and immeasurable.  

In other words, the Tathāgata has gone beyond all domains of measuring that are based on form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. His state is so deep and vast as to be beyond measurement.  

Therefore, none of the four statements about the Tathāgata’s existence or non-existence after death—“after death he exists, after death he does not exist, after death he both exists and does not exist, after death he neither exists nor does not exist”—applies to the Tathāgata’s state. One cannot describe it by “exists,” nor by “does not exist,” nor by “both exists and does not exist,” nor by “neither exists nor does not exist.” All such linguistic forms are ineffective in relation to the Tathāgata, and hence we conclude that they are inapplicable and are not to be declared.  

On the other hand, whether one can directly know and see the five aggregates and their arising and ceasing is the key condition determining whether attachment to the Tathāgata’s post-mortem state arises or is abandoned.  

If one cannot correctly know the nature of the five aggregates and their arising and ceasing, it is easy to generate attachment and extreme views concerning the Tathāgata’s state after death. Conversely, if one thoroughly and realistically understands the five aggregates and their arising and vanishing, one will no longer be bewildered by the fourfold propositions about the Tathāgata after death.  

Because the relationship between the Tathāgata and the aggregates is so subtle, and because the aggregates themselves are conditioned and subject to arising and ceasing, whether one penetrates the nature of the five aggregates directly determines whether one falls into these extreme views.  

From the perspective of attachment and dispassion, whether one is free from craving for the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—is precisely the condition for the arising or ceasing of the four views.  

If one is not free from craving, desire, affection, thirst, fever, and attachment toward the five aggregates, those four views—“after death the Tathāgata exists; after death he does not exist; after death he both exists and does not exist; after death he neither exists nor does not exist”—will naturally arise.  

In contrast, if one is free from craving, desire, affection, thirst, fever, and attachment toward the five aggregates, then those four views concerning the Tathāgata’s post-mortem state will not arise. Thus, the degree of one’s attachment to the five aggregates is the decisive factor that determines whether these four views occur.  

V.4 The Breakdown of Conditioned Language and the Core Principle of Non-Declaration  
In all discourse, any statement must depend upon causes and conditions to be meaningful. The domains that discourse refers to—whether “with form” or “formless,” “with perception,” “without perception,” or “neither with perception nor without perception”—are all spoken of dependent on causes and conditions.  

As long as the causes and conditions on which these domains rest are still present, it is possible to describe, distinguish, and discuss them. However, when all the causes and conditions that support these domains—those once referred to as “with form, formless, with perception, without perception, neither with perception nor without perception”—have wholly ceased without remainder, then there is no longer any basis available for describing them. Because there is nothing for language to take as its object, the referential function of language itself breaks down.  

The Tathāgata has cut off at the root all the causes tied to the five aggregates, so that they never arise again, and has gone beyond all domains that can be measured or calculated. In the state he has realized, all causes and conditions related to the domains of “with form, formless, with perception, without perception, neither with perception nor without perception” have been completely extinguished.  

Therefore, when people ask whether after death the Tathāgata “exists, does not exist, both exists and does not exist, or neither exists nor does not exist,” there is no longer any basis dependent on conditions from which such statements can be made. For this reason, none of these topics is declared.  

V.5 The Concrete Range of Questions That Are Not Answered  
Within the class of questions that are not answered, issues concerning the Tathāgata’s post-mortem state fall into a clearly specified range, which includes several closely related forms of questioning.  

For example, some ask: “Does the Tathāgata still exist after death?” Others ask: “Does the Tathāgata not exist after death?” Still others ask: “Does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death?” Or again: “Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?”  

There are also questions framed as: “Is the Tathāgata existent after death? Is the Tathāgata non-existent after death? Is the Tathāgata both existent and non-existent after death? Is the Tathāgata neither existent nor non-existent after death?”  

However they are worded, all these questions, in essence, inquire into those four possibilities—existence, non-existence, both, and neither—for the Tathāgata after death. All of them fall within the scope of what is not declared and not answered.  

VI. The Classification of Worldly Views, the Dilemma About “All Phenomena,” and Unprofitable Speculation  

VI.1 Three Major Categories of Worldly Views  
From a broader perspective, worldly views about reality can be summarized into several major types.  

The first type consists of views regarding the overall nature of the world: some say the world is permanent and unchanging, others that it is impermanent and changing; some claim the world is finite and bounded, others that it is infinite and boundless.  

The second type consists of views about the relationship between life (or soul) and the body. One school holds that “life and body are one,” claiming that life and body are essentially identical; another maintains that “life and body are different,” claiming that they are distinct from each other.  

The third type consists of views that focus on the post-mortem status of the Tathāgata, divided into the four positions that: after death the Tathāgata exists; after death he does not exist; after death he both exists and does not exist; after death he neither exists nor does not exist. These form the main categories of worldly views.  

VI.2 The Futility and Consequences of Denying “This All”  
In relation to the understanding of “all phenomena” (“the all”), there is another mistaken approach: if someone claims to have discarded “this all,” yet at the same time says that he has understood “another, different all,” such a claim is actually empty talk.  

For when he denies the “all” that is presently experienced, yet asserts that he knows some entirely different “all,” what he says contradicts the actual domain of experience and cannot stand up to concrete experience or reasonable examination. When he is cross-examined and questioned in detail, he will find himself unable to give a complete answer, and will ultimately only fall into greater suffering and confusion.  

To deny the present “all,” yet arbitrarily set up another “all,” is neither in accord with reality nor helpful for liberation.  

VI.3 Abandoning Unprofitable Worldly Speculation  
There is a type of speculation about the world and life that, from the standpoint of practice and liberation, is unprofitable. This includes repeatedly pondering whether “the world is permanent or impermanent, finite or infinite, whether life and body are one or different, and whether the Tathāgata exists, does not exist, or is in some other state after death.”  

Such speculation does not accord with the true meaning of the Dhamma and cannot guide one toward the fundamental aim of the holy life. More concretely, it does not help the practitioner to arouse disillusionment with the world, nor does it aid in the cutting off of craving. It does not lead to the extinction of defilements, does not bring about genuine mental stillness, does not increase wisdom for the direct realization of truth, and certainly does not lead to complete awakening and the realization of Nibbāna.  

Since such speculation is neither beneficial to liberation nor in harmony with the true doctrine, it should be abandoned and not pursued obsessively.  

VII. Gaining the Knowledge of Liberation and Avoiding the Two Extremes of Eternalism and Annihilationism  

VII.1 The Non-Dependent Path to the Knowledge of Liberation  
In seeking the knowledge that leads to liberation, one should not rely on several unreliable bases. First, one should not decide questions of truth merely on the basis of faith alone. Second, one should not take personal preferences and likes as the standard for judging right and wrong.  

One should also not accept a teaching hastily merely on the basis of hearsay and rumor. Nor should one become absorbed in pure theoretical disputation, imagining that victory or defeat in logic is identical with truth itself. Likewise, one should not rely on abstract reasoning and metaphysical speculation to make arbitrary judgments.  

The knowledge of liberation must be grounded in direct observation, right mindfulness and clear comprehension, and personal realization—not in these unstable external bases.  

VII.2 Avoiding Two Extreme Answers to the Question of Self-Existence  
When faced with the question “Do I exist or not?”, if one answers “I exist,” one aligns oneself with the position of the eternalists, who posit a permanent, unchanging self. Such an answer does not accord with the wisdom that all phenomena are not-self (anattā).  

If one answers “I do not exist,” one sides with the annihilationists, who maintain that everything ultimately ends in absolute nothingness. This kind of answer may also cause listeners to misunderstand, thinking that “formerly there was a self, but now there is no self,” thereby deepening their confusion about the question of self.  

Because both kinds of answer tend to drive people toward the extremes of eternalism or annihilationism, right view does not adopt such ways of answering. Instead, it takes dependent origination and not-self as its basis, and thereby goes beyond attachment to both “there is a self” and “there is no self.”  

In summary, the meaning of the Dhamma is in itself profound and hard to fathom. Many views concerning existence and non-existence, the nature of the world, the relation between life and body, and the Tathāgata’s state after death, if they fall into the two extremes of “being” and “non-being,” or are framed within the fourfold logical scheme, will deviate from the middle way of dependent origination and not-self.  

Only by understanding the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates, abandoning craving and clinging toward them, and relying not on faith, preference, hearsay, disputation, or speculation, but on right wisdom and direct observation, can one abandon such unprofitable worldly speculations and extreme views, and gradually advance toward the cessation of defilements, the stilling of the heart, sublime wisdom, complete awakening, and the realization of Nibbāna.
