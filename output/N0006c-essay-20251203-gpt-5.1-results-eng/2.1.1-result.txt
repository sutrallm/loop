<title> The Path of Liberation and the Four Noble Truths </title>
<article>
I. Fundamental Principles of Practice and Liberation  

I.1 Beyond Hearing: The Need for Personal Practice  

Merely hearing the teaching cannot truly lead to liberation. If one only listens but does not practice according to the teaching, it is impossible to reach complete liberation. Only by personally following the correct path of practice, committing body and mind to it, can one obtain firm and unshakable results.  

Proper listening is the beginning; careful reflection according to reality gives rise to correct understanding; energetic cultivation is the putting of that understanding into action. When these three are complete, they become the fundamental conditions for realizing nibbāna in this very life. If any one of them is missing, nibbāna cannot be realized here and now.  

Therefore, listening to the true Dhamma is the crucial starting point, and diligent cultivation is the crucial factor for fulfillment. On this basis, a practitioner should continue to learn, practice, and abide steadily in the meaning of the Dhamma that has been realized.  

I.2 The Immediate Benefit of Practice and the Unfailing Dhamma  

The nature of practice is present‑oriented; its benefit lies in the here and now. Such Dhamma was spoken by the Blessed One: it can be directly experienced in the present and leads onward to nibbāna; the wise should each realize it for themselves.  

There are three kinds of practice that bring immediate effect and do not deteriorate. Their characteristic is that they can be “verified by coming and seeing”: as long as one approaches them, observes them, and applies them, one can personally confirm their reality and efficacy.  

These three types of practice eliminate greed, hatred, and delusion. On this basis, they universally remove the intention to harm oneself, to harm others, and to harm both oneself and others, thereby fulfilling the goal of a practice that immediately leads toward nibbāna. Such unfailing Dhammas all refer to modes of practice that can be tested in the present and naturally tend toward liberation.  

I.3 Attitude in Hearing the Dhamma and Essentials of Study and Practice  

In the attitude of hearing and studying the Dhamma, a practitioner should “see the Dhamma and not be shaken”: once the Dhamma is truly seen, the mind is no longer disturbed by wrong views and external conditions. At the same time, one must constantly avoid heedlessness, never being lax regarding wholesome qualities that ought to be cultivated.  

Toward the teaching and the Teacher one should maintain reverence and study, serving the Dhamma and the Tathāgata with a respectful mind, and by one’s own practice realize the highest Dhamma. One must not only practice in accordance with the truth of the Buddha‑Dhamma, but also, on this path, gradually realize various attainments and finally reach the state of ultimate perfection.  

By adopting inferior methods one cannot accomplish the most excellent goal; only by adopting the most excellent methods is it possible to attain the most excellent result. This is the inevitable hierarchical law governing methods and results in practice.  

II. The Noble Eightfold Path and the Stages of Liberation  

II.1 The Noble Eightfold Path as the One and Only Fundamental Path  

Among all methods that lead to liberation, the Noble Eightfold Path is explicitly pointed out as the only path that leads toward the cessation of all links of dependent origination, and the only way leading to the ending of all conditioned processes and to liberation. This path specifically consists of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. It is also the way leading to the cessation of kamma.  

The cessation of kamma means that bodily action, verbal action, and mental action all completely come to a halt and are no longer produced, resulting in a state of liberation. The very path that can lead to this cessation is just the Noble Eightfold Path itself.  

When a practitioner lets “light/knowledge” guide their life, it gives rise to right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. When ignorance dominates, it gives rise to wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration, thus leading far away from liberation.  

In cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path, one must take seclusion, dispassion, and cessation as fundamental principles, and allow one’s entire practice to finally incline toward relinquishment. The same principle applies to the cultivation of the five powers and to all trainings that accord with liberation.  

When a practitioner trains along this path, they can correctly know and fully comprehend those phenomena that ought to be fully understood; correctly know and completely abandon those phenomena that ought to be abandoned; correctly know and directly realize here and now those phenomena that ought to be realized; and correctly know and continually cultivate all phenomena that ought to be cultivated. All of this is accomplished within the framework of the Noble Eightfold Path.  

II.2 The Sequence of Practice and the Ultimate Goal of the Holy Life  

The path of practice leading to liberation has a clear sequence. First comes right contemplation: through correct observation, the practitioner sees the true nature of phenomena as they really are, which gives rise to disenchantment with the world and with conditioned things. When disenchantment arises, dispassion naturally follows, gradually distancing one from craving and clinging. When dispassion becomes firm, liberation is attained; when liberation matures, nibbāna is realized. Nibbāna is the ultimate goal of the holy life, the state in which suffering has completely ceased.  

To reach this goal, the Noble Eightfold Path together with its related methods of practice form a path of liberation with a clearly defined course and mode of application. Nibbāna is not attained by accident; it is realized only by travelling along this concrete path.  

The purpose of living the holy life is to accomplish eight aims: first, to be far from sensual desire so that the mind is no longer dragged about by craving; second, to cut off the fetters that bind the mental continuum; third, to eradicate the underlying tendencies, so that the latent defilements hidden deep in the mind and liable to manifest at any time are completely extinguished; fourth, to fully understand the course of saṃsāric wandering and the path of liberation; fifth, to exhaust the taints (āsavas), so that all sources from which defilements flow out dry up; sixth, on this basis, to directly realize the fruit of liberation here and now; seventh, to gain knowledge and vision, so that with clear wisdom one sees all phenomena as they really are; and finally, eighth, to attain nibbāna without clinging, no longer grasping any phenomenon and perfecting liberation.  

II.3 The Four Establishments of Mindfulness, the Five Faculties and Five Powers, and the Common Law of Practice of All Buddhas  

All perfectly awakened ones, whether past, present, or future, accomplish awakening by relying on the same set of principles. On this path, the four establishments of mindfulness (four foundations of mindfulness) are said to be the one and only path that enables beings to be purified, to transcend sorrow and lamentation, to extinguish pain and grief, to realize the right method, and to directly realize nibbāna in this very life. This shows that the four establishments of mindfulness are not just one option among many, but the indispensable method that must be followed for purification and liberation.  

With respect to the five faculties, especially the faculty of wisdom, the practitioner should cultivate them upon the Four Noble Truths. The faculty of wisdom means that a noble disciple possesses wisdom, of a noble and discriminative kind, which follows in accord with the ending of suffering and fulfills the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away.  

Specifically, the practitioner will know suffering as it really is, know the origin of suffering as it really is, know the cessation of suffering as it really is, and know the path leading to the cessation of suffering as it really is. This is the actual manifestation of the faculty of wisdom.  

When this faculty of wisdom matures and becomes the power of wisdom, it should be cultivated based on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, with all practice inclined toward relinquishment. Such a way of cultivating the five powers fully accords with the principles of the Noble Eightfold Path—seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and inclination toward relinquishment—forming a single, integrated practice of liberation.  

III. Discernment and Remedies concerning Wholesome and Unwholesome States, Kamma, and the Five Aggregates  

III.1 Criteria for Wholesome and Unwholesome States and Pleasant Abiding in the Here and Now  

Regarding the discernment of wholesome and unwholesome states, the Blessed One laid down clear principles. Whether a particular state is praised or not depends on whether, in this very life, it leads to a pleasant abiding—whether it enables the practitioner to be free from obstacles, grief, and fever in the present, and to be reborn in a good destination at death—or, conversely, whether it leads to a painful abiding here and now, filling the practitioner with obstacles, grief, and fever, and causing rebirth in a bad destination at death.  

On the basis of this principle, as for unwholesome states: if they lead to painful abiding in the present and to an unfortunate rebirth, then the cutting off of such states is to be praised; if they would lead to pleasant abiding in the present and to a good rebirth, their cutting off is not praised. Conversely, regarding wholesome states: if they bring pleasant abiding in this life and a good rebirth, their possession and increase are to be praised; if instead they led to painful abiding here and now and to a bad rebirth, then their possession would not be praised.  

Therefore, the core of the Buddha’s teaching concerns suffering and the cessation of suffering; this has always been so in the past and remains so now. This criterion of discernment accords with the fact that the Blessed One chose to teach only a small portion of Dhamma: whatever accords with fundamental benefit, assists a pure life of practice, leads to disenchantment with the world and the cessation of craving, extinguishes defilements, quiets the mind, and brings about sublime wisdom, right awakening, and nibbāna—such teachings he adopted and proclaimed; the rest he discarded and did not teach.  

III.2 The Cessation of Kamma and the Method of Going Beyond the Five Aggregates  

There is a clear set of principles for dealing with the five aggregates and all defilements. To cut them off, one must do so by way of seclusion, extinguishing, letting go, and departing from these defilements. When the craving and clinging for the five aggregates is no longer nourished, the basis that serves as the cause of suffering will gradually collapse.  

The cessation of kamma also has a clear definition: when the production of bodily, verbal, and mental kamma has completely stopped, the practitioner has entered the liberated state of the cessation of kamma. The path leading to this cessation is not some other route but again the Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.  

In the course of practice, if a practitioner, following the teaching, observes the six sense bases, their six corresponding objects, the six consciousnesses, the six contacts, and the various feelings that arise dependent on them, then through such seeing in accordance with reality they will become disenchanted with all of this. Through disenchantment they will become dispassionate; through dispassion they will gain liberation. This process once again echoes the previously mentioned sequence of practice: right contemplation → disenchantment → dispassion → liberation → nibbāna.  

III.3 The Role of Meditation, Right Contemplation, and Knowledge and Vision of Things as They Really Are  

On the practical level, one should cultivate meditation (samādhi). When the mind becomes concentrated, the true nature of phenomena can appear just as it is. The practitioner should focus the mind on the perception of tranquillity, abide in this perception of tranquillity, and therein clearly see the true state of all phenomena as they really are.  

For all phenomena that are characterized by impermanence, suffering, and non‑self, one should abandon craving for them, because to generate craving for that which is impermanent, suffering, and non‑self can only lead to further suffering.  

In practice, one should use right wisdom to contemplate things as they really are. Through such contemplation, the practitioner realizes the truth and thereby is no longer reborn. When contemplating with right view, the result is the cutting off of craving, the destruction of all bonds, the extinguishing of conceit, and finally the ending of suffering.  

Such right contemplation is both the foundation of the holy life and the key to fulfilling its purpose and benefit. In contrast, wrong thinking cannot bring about any real benefit, is not the basis of the holy life, and cannot assist the attainment of the path.  

IV. The Content, Truth, and Central Status of the Four Noble Truths  

IV.1 The Core of the Buddha’s Teaching: Only Suffering and Its Cessation  

The core content of the Buddha’s teaching is the doctrine of the Four Noble Truths: the teaching of the truth “This is suffering”; the teaching of the truth “This is the origin (arising) of suffering”; the teaching of the truth “This is the cessation of suffering”; and the teaching of the truth “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”  

These four truths are repeatedly expounded because they are beneficial both for one’s present and long‑term welfare, practically support a pure life of practice, and lead to disenchantment with the world and the cessation of craving, thereby leading to the extinguishing of defilements, the inner peace of the mind, the arising of sublime wisdom, the completion of awakening, and the realization of nibbāna.  

Thus the Blessed One declared that what he established is only suffering and the cessation of suffering; this held true not only in this life but without exception in the past as well. He further explained that, in fact, the amount of Dhamma he actually taught is extremely small, essentially limited to the Four Noble Truths themselves.  

All selection and omission follow the same standard: whatever accords with fundamental benefit, supports the practice of the pure holy life, leads to disenchantment, to the cutting off of craving, to the extinguishing of defilements, to the quieting of the mind, and to the attainment of wisdom, right awakening, and nibbāna—this he preserved and explained fully. What does not meet this standard, he entirely set aside and did not discuss. Thus, the Four Noble Truths are confirmed as the fundamental doctrine of the Buddha’s teaching.  

IV.2 Definitions and Content of the Four Noble Truths  

The Four Noble Truths are the Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

The Noble Truth of Suffering speaks of the truth concerning suffering. Its specific content includes: the suffering of birth, the suffering of aging, the suffering of illness, the suffering of death; the suffering of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; the suffering of association with what is disliked, the suffering of separation from what is loved, the suffering of not getting what one desires; and, in brief, the suffering of the five aggregates subject to clinging. Regarding all this, the practitioner should “fully understand” suffering—that is, comprehensively and thoroughly know and understand its nature.  

When one attends appropriately to this Noble Truth of Suffering, there arise the eye, knowledge, wisdom, true understanding, and light.  

The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is the truth concerning the arising of suffering. It refers to craving that leads to future rebirth, accompanied by delight and lust, delighting in this and that; specifically: craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming (existence), and craving for non‑existence. This Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is to be abandoned, and in regard to it there arise the eye, knowledge, wisdom, true understanding, and light.  

The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering speaks of the truth of the ending of suffering. When craving is left behind and completely extinguished without remainder, when it is forsaken and relinquished, and on that basis there is liberation without further clinging—this is the state of the cessation of suffering. The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering is to be realized directly here and now, and with regard to it there arise the eye, knowledge, wisdom, true understanding, and light.  

The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering is the truth of the path that leads to the ending of suffering. This path is the Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering is to be cultivated; through actual cultivation it is to be fulfilled, and with regard to it there arise the eye, knowledge, wisdom, true understanding, and light.  

These Four Noble Truths are called “noble” because their nature is true; they do not deviate from truth and are not different from truth. In all the world, the Tathāgata is noble, and therefore the truths he proclaims are called noble truths.  

These four truths themselves are reality; they do not differ from reality nor deviate from it. This same reality applies universally to the four formulations “This is suffering,” “This is the origin of suffering,” “This is the cessation of suffering,” and “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”  

Furthermore, each Noble Truth is irreplaceable. To deny its correctness and attempt to establish some other so‑called noble truth is untenable. All four Noble Truths must be earnestly practiced; none of them may be neglected.  

IV.3 The Irreplaceability, Boundless Meaning, and Common Realization of the Four Noble Truths by All Buddhas  

The meaning of the Four Noble Truths contains boundless expressions, boundless formulations, and boundless layers of reasoning. No matter from which angle one expounds them, there are inexhaustibly deep meanings that can be drawn out. Yet regardless of how the words and arguments are developed, their core never departs from those four aspects: the nature of suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering—and, in practice, one must strive diligently in regard to these.  

All perfectly awakened ones, past, present, and future, realize the Four Noble Truths as they really are and in perfect equality. This shows that the Four Noble Truths are the truths commonly realized by the Buddhas, and that they are the key to both saṃsāric wandering and liberation.  

If one cannot truly know the Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, one will wander endlessly in saṃsāra and never gain liberation. Conversely, once one has penetrated and fully understood the Four Noble Truths, one can cut off craving for existence, bring to an end all seeking for further becoming, and no longer be subject to future rebirth.  

Precisely for this reason, if a certain ascetic or brahmin cannot truly know the Four Noble Truths, they cannot be acknowledged as a genuine practitioner. Only one who truly knows the Four Noble Truths can be recognized as a genuine practitioner and can realize liberation in this very life.  

V. The Direction and Concrete Methods for Directly Seeing the Four Noble Truths  

V.1 What Is to Be Done with Each of the Noble Truths: Full Understanding, Abandoning, Realization, and Cultivation  

Within the Four Noble Truths, each truth has its own task to be accomplished. The Noble Truth of Suffering, concerning the truth of suffering, is to be thoroughly known and fully understood. The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, concerning the arising of suffering, is to be abandoned. The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, concerning the ending of suffering, is to be personally realized here and now. The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, concerning the path leading to the cessation of suffering, is to be cultivated over the long term.  

When these specific tasks have been completed, there arise the eye, knowledge, wisdom, true understanding, and light regarding Dhamma that had not been heard before.  

The realization of the Four Noble Truths follows a complete process: one must regard them with the three rounds and twelve aspects of knowledge and vision as they really are, until one’s knowledge is purified in every respect. As long as this knowledge of the Four Noble Truths is not fully purified, one cannot be said to have attained unsurpassed, perfectly complete awakening; once this knowledge is purified and complete, only then can one be said to have attained unsurpassed, perfectly complete awakening.  

This principle applies not only to the understanding of the links of dependent origination—each link’s definition, its causes of arising, its methods of cessation, and the path of practice—but also generally to understanding the Four Noble Truths.  

Therefore, the scriptures repeatedly urge us to make an effort regarding “This is suffering,” to make an effort regarding “This is the origin of suffering,” to make an effort regarding “This is the cessation of suffering,” and to make an effort regarding “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”  

This “making an effort” includes diligence, exertion, cultivation, practice, observation, penetration, and direct realization. Its purpose is to remind practitioners not to become lax or negligent with respect to any one of the truths.  

V.2 Requirements of Reflection, Contemplation, and Joyful Direct Seeing  

In practice, the Four Noble Truths should be the main content of one’s searching, reflection, and discussion. A practitioner should frequently reflect: This is suffering; this is the origin of suffering; this is the cessation of suffering; this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.  

Such reflection accords with true meaning, is the foundation of the holy life, and assists the arising of disenchantment, the cutting off of craving, the extinguishing of defilements, and the pacification of the mind. It is also conducive to the arising of the wisdom of realization, the completion of full awakening, and the attainment of nibbāna.  

Therefore, practitioners should not only take the Four Noble Truths as objects of reflection, but also as the main theme of Dhamma discussion, mutually encouraging one another to work hard in contemplation of the Four Noble Truths.  

When directly seeing the Four Noble Truths, there is a specific reminder that this direct seeing should be done with joy and happiness, not with suffering and sorrow. In other words, one should not approach the Four Noble Truths with a depressed, repressed, or pessimistic mindset, but with a clear, joyful, confident, and positive mind that sees their reality. If one does so, the Four Noble Truths will bring to the practitioner the eye, knowledge, wisdom, true understanding, and light.  

V.3 Right View, Right Thought, and Beneficial Reflection  

Right view is the forerunner and precursor enabling the direct seeing of the Four Noble Truths. One who has right view can know as they really are: “This is suffering,” “This is the origin of suffering,” “This is the cessation of suffering,” and “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,” and because of this knowledge they strive diligently concerning them.  

Correspondingly, beneficial reflection is to direct the mind toward each of the Four Noble Truths and repeatedly reflect upon them. Such reflection accords with true meaning and is the foundation of the entire holy life, giving rise to disenchantment, assisting the cutting off of craving, extinguishing defilements, leading to the stilling of the mind, the arising of wisdom, the completion of awakening, and the realization of nibbāna.  

Therefore, one should diligently exert oneself in understanding “This is suffering,” “This is the origin of suffering,” “This is the cessation of suffering,” and “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.” This diligence is not only cognitive but also practical: it requires both knowledge in accordance with reality and thorough implementation in one’s conduct.  

VI. The Law, Results, and Similes of Knowledge of the Four Noble Truths  

VI.1 The Law of Hearing, Reflection, and Cultivation, and Ignorance and Knowledge Regarding the Four Noble Truths  

On the path of practice toward liberation there is a causal law of hearing, reflection, and cultivation. Correctly hearing the essentials of liberation is the beginning of understanding. Basing oneself on these teachings and coming to know them as they really are is the result of reflection. On the basis of clear understanding, diligently cultivating is the work of practice.  

Only when hearing, understanding, and cultivation are all complete can one realize nibbāna here and now. This law applies not only to liberation itself, but also generally to overcoming the five hindrances and cultivating all wholesome states. If one does not properly know those states that should be cultivated and lead to nibbāna, or if one knows them only slightly but does not diligently cultivate them, then one cannot enter nibbāna in this very life. Conversely, if one correctly knows these paths leading to nibbāna and diligently cultivates them, one can realize nibbāna in this very life.  

Ignorance manifests concretely as the inability to know the Four Noble Truths correctly: not knowing as they really are “This is suffering,” “This is the origin of suffering,” “This is the cessation of suffering,” and “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”  

To overcome ignorance, a practitioner should diligently strive to know the Four Noble Truths correctly and turn the mind toward “light/knowledge.” This light (knowledge) is wisdom regarding the Four Noble Truths, specifically, wisdom concerning suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; possessing such wisdom is called being “in accord with light/knowledge.”  

When light/knowledge is present, it conditions the arising of right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. When ignorance dominates, it conditions wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong concentration, keeping life turning within saṃsāra and suffering.  

VI.2 The Fault of Not Penetrating the Four Noble Truths and Falling into the Darkness of Life  

If one cannot truly know the Four Noble Truths, one will forever wander in saṃsāra and may even fall into bad destinies. One who has not penetrated the Four Noble Truths does not know suffering, its origin, its cessation, or the path leading to its cessation as they really are, and thus the heart is full of doubt. Such a person may often look at the faces of other practitioners, wondering: “Is this venerable one truly a knower and seer?” Their mind is like a light tuft of cotton, blown about and unsettled by every gust of wind, and the cause of this is precisely their failure to see the Four Noble Truths. This state is described as falling into the darkness of life.  

There is a “law of falling into and transcending the darkness of life” that explains how this operates: one’s state of knowledge regarding the Four Noble Truths—whether one knows them as they really are or not—directly determines whether one falls into the darkness of life or is liberated from it. If one does not truly know the Four Noble Truths, one’s tendency is to cling, which increases the causes of suffering and leads into the darkness of life, without liberation.  

If one truly knows them, one is free from clinging, the causes of suffering no longer increase, and one does not fall into the darkness of life but instead gains liberation.  

Therefore, if someone claims that, without truly seeing the Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, they can nonetheless transcend all sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, and reach the end of suffering, this is utterly impossible—just like trying to use unsuitable leaves such as the khadira leaf, the palāśa leaf, or the āmalaka leaf to make a container that can hold and transport water; it is absurd and impractical.  

The basic cause of falling into bad destinies is precisely the failure to see the Four Noble Truths. All the manifold inversions and circlings of phenomena can ultimately be traced back to not contemplating the Four Noble Truths as their root.  

VI.3 The Merit, Levels, and Fruits of Penetrating the Four Noble Truths  

Conversely, if someone can truly see the Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering and, through this, reach the end of suffering, this is reasonable and possible—just like using suitable leaves such as lotus leaves, palāśa leaves, or broad nimbus leaves to fashion containers that can hold and transport water; it is practical and effective.  

When one truly sees the Four Noble Truths, the mind no longer clings to those fundamental processes that lead to birth, aging, and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. Because these root processes no longer increase and the inner fever no longer burns, liberation is attained.  

A person who has penetrated the Four Noble Truths knows suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation as they really are. They no longer need to examine others’ faces or depend on others’ words to determine who is a knower and seer. Their mind is like an Indra‑pillar deeply rooted and firmly planted, unshaken and unmoved by winds and storms from any direction; the reason is that they have well seen the Four Noble Truths.  

One who possesses correct knowledge and has completed direct seeing will, at most, undergo seven more cycles of birth and death before reaching the end of suffering; such a person is called “one who returns at most seven times.” Such an attainer fully understands the entire content of the Four Noble Truths.  

In this attainment, one who sees suffering also sees the origin of suffering, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; one who sees the origin of suffering likewise sees suffering, its cessation, and the path; one who sees the cessation of suffering likewise sees suffering, its origin, and the path; and one who sees the path leading to the cessation of suffering likewise sees suffering, its origin, and its cessation.  

From another angle, to know as it really is “This is suffering” is itself the exhaustion of the taints; to know as it really is “This is the origin of suffering” is likewise the exhaustion of the taints; and to know as they really are “This is the cessation of suffering” and “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering” is equally the way to the exhaustion of the taints. Thus, the true knowledge of the Four Noble Truths and the realization of the exhaustion of the taints are two aspects of the same single process.  

VI.4 The Difficulty of Practicing the Four Noble Truths, Encouragement, and Illustrative Similes  

Penetrating the Four Noble Truths is something extremely hard to do. There is a simile that says: if one were to split a single hair into one hundred parts and then thread a point from one end through to the other, this would already be harder than the skill of archery; yet to penetrate the Four Noble Truths is even harder than piercing through that hundred‑fold hair.  

Even so, one should still exert oneself diligently to penetrate “This is suffering,” “This is the origin of suffering,” “This is the cessation of suffering,” and “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,” never relenting.  

In practical cultivation, there is also a law governing the increase and ending of the fundamental processes of existence: if one does not truly know suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, one will cling to those fundamental processes that lead to birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, thereby causing them to continue to grow, igniting the inner fever and preventing liberation.  

If one truly knows these four, one no longer clings to such fundamental processes; they no longer grow, the inner fever no longer flares up, and liberation is attained. From this one can see that one’s state of knowledge leads to a tendency to cling or not to cling; the tendency to cling leads to either the growth or cessation of the causes of suffering, and the increase or decrease of these causes directly determines whether one falls into or transcends the darkness of life, ultimately ending either in non‑liberation or liberation.  

VII. The Responsibility to Spread the Four Noble Truths, Their Universality, and the Standard of Right View  

VII.1 The Common Path of All Buddhas and Practitioners  

The Four Noble Truths are the truths commonly realized by all Buddhas. All perfectly awakened ones—past, present, and future—realize the Four Noble Truths as they really are and in perfect equality, and they attain awakening in accordance with these truths.  

From the perspective of time, all practitioners of the past practiced for the sake of directly seeing the Four Noble Truths; practitioners of the future will do likewise; and practitioners of the present similarly take the direct seeing of the Four Noble Truths as their goal. From the perspective of the practitioners themselves, all virtuous men, whether lay or monastic, take the direct seeing of the Four Noble Truths as the aim of their practice; all ascetics and brahmins who truly awaken do so on the basis of the direct seeing of the Four Noble Truths.  

Thus any genuine practitioner must base their stable understanding on a real cognition of “This is suffering,” “This is the origin of suffering,” “This is the cessation of suffering,” and “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.” If one cannot truly know the Four Noble Truths, one cannot be acknowledged as a genuine practitioner; only by truly knowing the Four Noble Truths can one be recognized as a genuine practitioner and realize liberation here and now.  

As truths that are “such, not departing from such, not differing from such,” the Four Noble Truths are, in all the world, the truths commonly confirmed by the Tathāgata and all Buddhas.  

VII.2 The Responsibility to Instruct Relatives and the Duty of Repeated Reflection  

Regarding all relatives and kin who merit compassion and for whom we ought to arrange opportunities to hear the Dhamma, we have the responsibility to urge them toward the direct seeing of the Four Noble Truths and to help them dwell long in such practice. Since the Four Noble Truths are truths that must be directly seen and practiced, we should not only practice them personally, but also encourage those connected with us in affinity to train in them together. This exhortation and propagation arises from compassion for one another’s welfare and liberation.  

In daily practice and interaction, one should take the Four Noble Truths as objects of searching, as themes of reflection, and as topics of discussion, mutually urging each other to practice contemplation of the Four Noble Truths. Such repeated reflection and discussion enable practitioners to constantly strengthen right view and right confidence, and make the meaning of the Four Noble Truths ever clearer and deeper in their hearts.  

VIII. Conclusion: From Craving to the Nibbāna of the Cessation of Suffering  

In summary, practice is a path that has benefit here and now. It can be directly experienced in the present and leads onward to nibbāna. This Dhamma was personally taught by the Blessed One; the wise should each know and apply it for themselves.  

When we follow the correct sequence of hearing, reflection, and cultivation—hearing the true Dhamma, reflecting in accordance with reason, diligently cultivating—and when we continue over the long term to learn, practice, and abide in the meaning of the Dhamma, we can gradually withdraw from infatuation with craving and conditioned phenomena, instead relying on the Noble Eightfold Path and the four establishments of mindfulness, supported along the way by the five faculties and five powers, especially the faculty and power of wisdom.  

On this path we learn to use the actual results of wholesome and unwholesome states as our criterion of discernment, turning away from unwholesome states that lead to painful abiding here and now and to bad destinies, and cultivating wholesome states that bring pleasant abiding here and now and good destinies. We learn to counter the five aggregates and all defilements through seclusion, extinguishing, letting go, and departure. We learn to rely on meditation and right contemplation, using right wisdom to see phenomena as they really are, until craving is cut off, the bonds are destroyed, conceit is extinguished, and the end of suffering is reached.  

Ultimately, the overall principle returns to the direct seeing and practice of the Four Noble Truths. Only by directly seeing suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, and by repeatedly urging ourselves to carry out what is to be done with each—fully understanding suffering, abandoning its origin, directly realizing its cessation, and cultivating the path leading to its cessation—can we fundamentally cut off ignorance and craving, so that the fundamental processes leading to birth, aging, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair no longer increase, all inner fever is extinguished, and we accomplish dispassion, the cutting off of fetters, the ending of the taints, knowledge and vision, and nibbāna without clinging, thus fulfilling the ultimate goal of the holy life.
