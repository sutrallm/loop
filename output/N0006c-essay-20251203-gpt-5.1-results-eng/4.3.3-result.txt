I. Avoiding Unwholesome Actions and Purifying Body, Speech, and Mind

I.1 Drawing Near to Good Friends and Refraining from All Evil

On the path of practice, associating with good friends brings direct and obvious benefits. Those who live with and are guided by good friends can learn to perform wholesome deeds and refrain from committing various unwholesome acts. This influence not only restrains a person’s outward behavior, but also leads them, in everyday choices, to naturally incline toward wholesome action and away from unwholesome action.

One of the fundamental rules of wholesome conduct is never to create unwholesome karma under any circumstances. The core of practice is summarized as: with the three karmas of body, speech, and mind, do not perform any evil at all. That is, do not commit evil with the body, do not speak evil with the tongue, and do not give rise to evil thoughts in the mind. When a person can avoid unwholesome deeds in all three—body, speech, and mind—then the foundation for pure practice is established.

I.2 Motivation for Action and Consistency in Public and in Private

In terms of codes of conduct and motivation, what is emphasized is a proper and upright attitude toward life. A person who truly seeks to live properly will, fearing the reproach of others and unwilling to make themselves an object of blame, refrain from doing evil deeds. This fear of reproach is not merely a fear of external judgment, but a moral awareness of right and wrong that makes one unwilling to stain one’s own character and reputation through unwholesome acts.

At the same time, the prohibition of unwholesome actions does not apply only to external behavior in front of others. The basic rule clearly states: whether in public or in private moments unseen by others, one must not perform any unwholesome deed whatsoever. If unwholesome karma has already been created, then one cannot escape the suffering that arises from it. This suffering is not limited to a present psychological burden; it also includes various forms of pain and anxiety that follow as the result of that evil karma. Thus, true self-protection means guarding oneself equally in light and in darkness, in front of others and when alone, by consistently refraining from all evil.

I.3 Standards for Purifying the Three Karmas of Body, Speech, and Mind

The practice of purifying bodily karma is repeatedly emphasized in many places. One method of protecting oneself is to perform wholesome deeds with the body and not unwholesome ones. Specifically, one should refrain from any bodily act that harms others, not use violence or improper means to satisfy one’s desires, and instead use the body in upright ways to carry out actions beneficial to oneself and to others. Pure bodily conduct also includes refraining from all improper forms of violation and appropriation, such as not stealing and not wrongfully taking what belongs to others.

Purity of speech karma is equally important. Doing wholesome deeds with speech and not unwholesome ones means not using words to harm others; not speaking divisive, harsh, deceitful, or frivolous words that pollute others’ minds; but rather communicating with truthful, gentle, upright, and beneficial speech. Moreover, many teachings specifically point out that avoiding evil and unwholesome speech is one of the standards for a practitioner. Guarding speech not only prevents the creation of bad verbal karma, it also helps establish stable and harmonious human relationships.

Purity of mental karma lies in the operation of wholesome thoughts in the mind. Doing wholesome deeds with the mind and not unwholesome ones means not cultivating greed, hatred, and wrong views internally, but allowing the mind to incline toward kindness and gentleness. Having correct intentions prevents a person from being driven by evil thoughts; even when external circumstances are complex, one can still maintain inner uprightness and clarity.

I.4 The Basis of Security and a Gentle Disposition

The basis of security in the world is described as several interrelated factors. First are right speech and right intention—that is, the purity of speech and mental karma mentioned above. Next is refraining from unwholesome bodily actions, not doing evil with the body. In addition, one must possess firm faith and a gentle disposition. Faith gives one reliance on the true Dharma; gentleness prevents one from treating others with harshness and brutality. Taken together, these conditions form the foundation for inner peace and harmonious relations with others.

II. Contents of the Precepts and the Various Evils to Be Avoided

II.1 The Five Serious Misdeeds and Fear in This Life and the Next

In discussing fear and distress in the world, many teachings point out five kinds of behavior that bring fear, pain, and anxiety in this life and in future lives. These five are: taking life, stealing (or taking what is not given), sexual misconduct (or wrongful sensual conduct), false speech, and drinking alcohol or taking any intoxicant that leads to drunkenness and heedlessness. If one can bring these five behaviors to a halt, one can eliminate the inner unease and fear that they cause.

These five types of behavior are called serious misdeeds that lead to fear. Bringing them to cessation not only eliminates fear in this life, but is also one of the core conditions for achieving the fruit of stream-entry. For lay followers, these five are also the standard of complete moral conduct. Some teachings state clearly: if a lay follower (upāsaka) fully refrains from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from drinking alcohol, then it can be said that their precepts are complete. Other teachings explain that one who upholds these five precepts can dwell in their home without fear, because they avoid taking life, avoid taking what is not given, avoid sexual misconduct, avoid false speech, and avoid all intoxicating drinks that lead to drunkenness and heedlessness.

Elsewhere, the items of moral conduct are repeatedly presented with slightly different wording. In one place, the five precepts are described as: refraining from taking life; refraining from taking what is not given; in regard to sense desires, refraining from wrongful conduct; refraining from false speech; and refraining from barley liquor, flower liquor, and other intoxicating, heedlessness-inducing things. In another place, these five are summed up as a path to ending fear and enmity, explaining that if one refrains from killing, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from drinking alcohol, then one can bring to rest the fear, hostility, and inner pain and sorrow that these behaviors would otherwise cause in this life and in future lives.

II.2 Ten Unwholesome Actions to Be Abandoned and Details of Verbal Karma

Further speaking, the description of unwholesome behavior is not limited to the five items, but is elaborated into ten kinds of evil actions that should be abandoned. These ten are: destroying life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, frivolous speech, covetousness, ill will and hatred, and wrong views. Correct teaching should, in various ways, describe the faults of these unwholesome actions and clearly forbid their practice. After hearing such teachings, disciples should feel remorse for unwholesome deeds they committed in the past, recognize that those actions were improper and unwholesome, and thereby give rise to the intention to abandon them, resolving not to commit them again in the future. Through truly giving them up, they can transcend the bondage of past evil karma and no longer be dragged by present and future suffering resulting from it.

In general circumstances of precept-keeping among sentient beings, another list of ten things to be avoided is given. These ten are: killing, taking what is not given (that is, stealing), sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, frivolous or impure speech, damaging grasses and trees, eating at improper times, and using or adorning oneself with garlands, perfumes, and unguents. Here, not only is the need to avoid bodily and verbal unwholesome actions emphasized again, but the teaching further extends to avoiding damage to natural objects, regulating the time of eating, and restraining external adornment.

II.3 Prohibitions on Killing, False Speech, and Harming the Innocent

In the most basic precepts, two items are particularly highlighted as fundamental practices for leaving suffering and attaining happiness. First, never kill any living being; regardless of how big or small, noble or lowly the being is, one must not take its life. Second, when one knows the actual facts, one must not speak false and untrue words. That is, one must not deceive others with lies, nor conceal the truth or invert right and wrong.

Furthermore, clear guidelines are given for one’s attitude toward pursuing personal goals. In seeking to accomplish one’s aims, one should avoid harming the innocent and must not sacrifice unrelated people to achieve one’s own plans. Even when at a disadvantage and in an extremely unfavorable situation, one must still uphold the true Dharma and not, because of difficult circumstances, abandon proper principles or resort to improper means.

II.4 Reflection and Precaution Regarding Stealing and Sexual Misconduct

Within the requirement of pure bodily karma, concrete methods of reflection are given for avoiding theft and sexual misconduct. Regarding taking what is not given—that is, stealing another’s property—one should reflect as follows: since I myself do not want my belongings to be stolen, I likewise should not steal the belongings of others. Through this contemplation of exchanging self and others, one not only refrains from stealing oneself, but also encourages others to avoid stealing and praises all actions that refrain from theft, so that society as a whole may be free from this evil behavior.

The same mode of contemplation is taught with respect to sexual misconduct. One should consider that, just as one does not want one’s own spouse to be violated by others, one should not violate the spouse of another. From this arises respect for other people’s families: not only does one maintain self-restraint and avoid sexual misconduct, one also encourages others to refrain from it and praises all behavior that protects proper relationships. Such reflection and observance prevent a person from, due to momentary desire, destroying another’s family and their own purity.

II.5 Broader Lifestyle Prohibitions and Limits on Entertainment and Property

In broader lifestyle regulations, there are many additional precepts related to food, adornment, and entertainment. Some teachings explicitly state that eating at improper times should be avoided; that is, eating should be limited to appropriate times with restraint, and one should not eat at unsuitable times. In addition, garlands, perfumes, and unguents used to decorate and beautify the body are also listed among the things to be avoided, reminding practitioners not to indulge in external adornments of scent and flowers.

Regarding entertainment, dancing, singing, music, and watching performances are all regarded as forms of amusement that should be avoided. These activities easily stir up emotions, causing the mind to linger on sensual pleasures of sights and sounds and to forget the essential task of practice. Therefore, for those who practice strictly, such entertainments should not be part of daily life.

In terms of living conditions, high and luxurious beds are also listed as objects to be avoided. This indicates that one’s dwelling and place of rest should be simple, not valuing height, size, and luxury, so as to avoid nurturing habits of indulgence in comfort and extravagance.

Regulations regarding property and possessions are even more explicit. Some teachings state that gold and silver, raw grain, raw meat, women and girls, male and female servants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, as well as elephants, cattle, horses, and mules—all of these are items that should not be accepted. Such restrictions prevent practitioners from being entangled by property, livestock, and retainers, and also block the many kinds of affliction and impure conduct that can arise from owning, trading, or employing them.

III. Purity, Merit, Results, and Worldly Bondage

III.1 The Nature of Purity: Not Derived from Lineage or Wealth

Regarding the nature of purity, many teachings point to a common core: purity does not come from clan origin or the amount of one’s wealth, but from moral discipline and wisdom. A person’s family background and material possessions cannot serve as criteria for judging whether one is pure. Only through rigorous observance of precepts and penetrating wisdom can true purity be achieved.

Some teachings say that the wise will carefully reflect upon their own welfare, valuing long-term and genuine benefit, correctly choosing the true Dharma and practicing in accordance with it. Because of such discernment and practice, they attain inner purity and calm, far from delusion and turmoil.

Another explanation further supplements the conditions of purity. Purity is established upon goodwill, wisdom, meditative concentration, moral discipline, and right livelihood. With goodwill, all actions begin from benefit to self and others; with wisdom, one can correctly distinguish good from evil, right from wrong; with meditative concentration, the mind can be stilled and not scattered; with precepts and right livelihood, one’s way of life is upright, not relying on impure means of making a living. A person who is pure by virtue of these conditions is not pure because of family name or house, but because they have realized these inner qualities.

III.2 Characteristics of Moral Conduct and the Central Role of Virtue

The wholesome qualities of those who uphold the precepts manifest in their pure moral conduct and virtuous behavior. Such people not only avoid violating precept rules in a formal sense; in their actual lives they also display uprightness, gentleness, and nonharming behavior. This pure moral conduct is the root of all wholesome qualities and the foundation upon which all other fruits of practice are built.

In teachings about the completeness of powers and sources of support, the pivotal place of moral virtue is especially emphasized. If a person lacks moral virtue, then even if they possess four other types of power, they may still be expelled by their relatives, forbidden to live at home, and unable to gain the acceptance of family and community. Conversely, if a person possesses moral virtue, then even if they lack any of the other four powers, their relatives will still allow them to live at home and will not cast them out. From this, we can see that moral virtue is regarded as the most crucial among the various powers, determining a person’s standing and belonging in family and society.

III.3 Fearlessness, the Ending of Fear, and a Contrast with External Bondage

When a person upholds the five precepts mentioned earlier—refraining from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from all intoxicants that lead to drunkenness and heedlessness—they can dwell in their home without fear. This fearlessness arises because they know well that they have not committed those unwholesome acts that bring fear and retribution, and thus need not worry about fear and enmity arising in this life and in future lives as evil karma ripens.

Elsewhere, it is clearly stated that if one simply stops killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and drinking alcohol, one can eliminate the inner fear, pain, and distress that these acts would otherwise cause in this and future lives. Other teachings similarly say that if one refrains from killing, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from drinking alcohol, the fear, hostility, and mental suffering and anxiety that these deeds would cause in this life and the next will all be brought to rest. All these explanations emphasize one point: avoiding major unwholesome actions is not only an ethical requirement, but also the key to removing inner fear and sorrow.

At the same time, the truth of worldly bondage is presented from another angle. First, outer forms of restraint are pointed out, such as being bound with ropes, caught with nets, or shackled with chains. These are visible, tangible external restraints that deprive a person of freedom of movement. In contrast, there is the inner fear and unease created by unwholesome deeds and evil karma; though invisible, these bind a person just as effectively and prevent true ease. The contrast between these two kinds of bondage helps one better understand why it is necessary, through observing precepts and abandoning evil, to free oneself from both inner and outer forms of constraint.

IV. Confession, Acknowledging Fault, and Transcending Evil Karma

IV.1 The Proper Way to Acknowledge Fault and Confess

When a person has committed a fault, the right attitude is not to conceal it or shift blame, but to see one’s own mistake as it truly is. To “see it as it truly is” means clearly acknowledging, “This is my fault,” without offering any excuses or self-justification. After seeing it, one should acknowledge the error in accordance with the Dharma and sincerely confess it. Confession is not merely uttering a few formal words; it must arise from genuine inner regret for the unwholesome deed and a firm resolve not to repeat it.

Moreover, when others point out one’s faults in accordance with the Dharma, one should accept their correction, rather than becoming angry from embarrassment or refusing to acknowledge the fault. Being able to calmly accept having one’s faults pointed out correctly, and on that basis committing to amend them, is the mark of a person who truly practices confession. This process of confession and correction prevents unwholesome actions from continuing to accumulate and transforms them into opportunities for adjustment and further effort.

IV.2 Conditions for Confession and Acceptance

There are more specific criteria regarding confession and acceptance. One condition for valid confession is that the person already knows their action is indeed a wrongdoing, and does not still regard it as justified or natural. Only on the premise of “already recognized as a fault” does confession truly have meaning. Secondly, one must also resolve not to commit the act again in the future, thereby ending the repetition of that unwholesome behavior. Without such a resolution, confession remains only a momentary emotion and cannot bring about substantial change.

As for acceptance (being re-accepted into the community or into right conduct), the conditions lie in seeing fault as fault and confessing according to the Dharma. To see fault as fault means no longer seeking any excuse for one’s unwholesome actions, but clearly understanding that they are wrong in themselves. Then, one confesses in a manner consistent with the Dharma, rather than treating it casually and perfunctorily. When both of these conditions are fulfilled, confession is considered complete, and the unwholesome acts can truly begin to be set aside.

IV.3 The Process of Ending the Bondage of Unwholesome Actions

Correct teaching does more than list unwholesome and wholesome deeds; it also explains the harm of unwholesome actions and leads disciples to heartfelt remorse. When disciples hear about the various faults of evil actions, they develop remorse regarding their own past unwholesome deeds, recognizing that such behavior is improper and unwholesome, and naturally give rise to the intention to abandon it. This understanding and remorse inspire them truly to stay far away from unwholesome actions and not repeat them in the future.

Through such renunciation, unwholesome deeds no longer continue to accumulate into new evil karma, and the bondage of past evil karma is gradually transcended. Although the evil karma already created still has its results, because one’s mindset and behavior have changed and one no longer continues to create further evil, and because one sincerely confesses and performs wholesome acts to offset and repair, one can gradually free oneself from the heavy pull of unwholesome karma.

V. Lifestyle Regulations for Monastics and Practitioners

V.1 Standards for Bhikṣus and Śramaṇas and Rules on What They May Receive

There is a special explanation of the definition and standards of a bhikṣu (monk). A true bhikṣu must relinquish attachment to foul and defiled things, and also abandon clinging to all merits and all evil deeds. Here, “abandonment” includes giving up attachment to impure dharmas, as well as letting go of grasping at merit and at unwholesome acts themselves. Only thus can one avoid being bound by various phenomena and abide in purity.

In terms of mental conduct, the standards for a bhikṣu include several concrete aspects. First, there is no scheming after sensual desires in his mind; he is not driven by various cravings. Second, he does not follow after sixty kinds of unlawful thoughts and imaginings; he does not let his mind chase after ideas and views that do not accord with the true Dharma. Third, he does not attach himself to any sect or faction; he does not confine his identity to a particular group or set himself in opposition to others on that basis. Finally, he avoids evil and unwholesome speech, carefully guarding his verbal karma so that it does not become a tool for harming others or creating bad karma.

As a śramaṇa (ascetic), there are also clear principles regarding the use of requisites for living. Items such as grass, firewood, carts, and human labor, which are basic necessities, may be requested as needed to sustain life and practice. However, with respect to gold and silver, there is an absolute prohibition: under no circumstances may gold or silver be sought or accepted. This strict ban is intended to free śramaṇas from entanglement with wealth, so that they will not, because of gold and silver, give rise to greed or engage in various impure behaviors.

V.2 Simple Living and Abandoning External Adornment

Practitioners are encouraged to give up external adornments in their lifestyle. Specifically, they should not damage or alter the natural luster of their bodies for the sake of beautifying their appearance; they should not wear soft and finely woven clothes in order to increase comfort and enjoyment; they should not adorn the eyes and other body parts with decorations, nor use earrings, jewelry, cosmetics, and other items to intentionally beautify sensory appearance; and they should not insist on using elegant and luxurious utensils, increasing attachment because of the refinement of their eating vessels.

In contrast, practitioners should abide in a simple and pure mode of conduct. This includes living in quiet places, far from noise and commotion; practicing the method of begging for alms, sustaining life by going on almsround rather than hoarding property; wearing discarded or cast-off clothing, keeping dress at the level of simply covering the body and warding off the cold, without seeking splendor; and cutting off longing for worldly sensual pleasures, no longer treating sensory enjoyment as the goal of life. Such a simple and pure lifestyle enables practitioners to concentrate more fully on inner cultivation.

V.3 Communal Monastic Life and Avoiding Entanglement in Worldly Affairs

For those living together in a monastic community, there are three basic principles to observe. First, one must avoid disrupting the harmony of the Saṅgha; one should not use words or actions to sow division or tear the community apart. Second, one must prevent disturbing and confusing lay followers; one should not cause laypeople, through improper conduct or speech, to develop doubts about or lose confidence in the true Dharma. Third, one must preserve the purity of the Dharma’s transmission, allowing the teaching to be passed on in a pure form and not be corrupted by wrong views or impure behavior.

In addition, among eight types of obstacles, there is one called “being taken over by others.” It refers to excessively associating with laypeople, sharing all their joys and sorrows, and becoming overly involved in their worldly affairs, so that one ends up going along with worldly matters and forgetting the primary task of practice. When practitioners immerse themselves in secular business, sharing the ups and downs, success and failure, and worldly honors and disgraces of laypeople, their minds readily drift away from purity and lose the proper focus of spiritual cultivation. Thus, such obstacles must be carefully guarded against.

VI. Pure Faith, Precepts, and the Path of the Lay Upāsaka

VI.1 The Precepts Cherished by the Noble Ones and the Causes of Samādhi

In discussing the attainment of pure faith and precepts, there is a passage that specifically explains “the precepts cherished by the noble ones.” To fulfill the precepts cherished by the noble ones means to observe those moral rules that are praised by noble beings. Such precepts have several characteristics: they are unbroken, unruptured, untainted, and undefiled—that is, they are not violated, have no gaps, are not mixed with wrong views or impure behavior, and are not stained by defilements. Precepts of this kind free one from bondage, are praised by the wise, and are not clung to as “I” or “mine.” Instead, they become conditions that give rise to samādhi, allowing the mind to abide in a state of calm and focused stillness.

VI.2 The Fivefold Completeness of the Lay Upāsaka and the Results of Moral Virtue

For the lay upāsaka, being complete in the five precepts is the mark of fully developed moral conduct. These five precepts are: refraining from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from drinking alcohol. When these precepts are complete, the lay follower will not plant the seeds of suffering through unwholesome deeds in daily life and will align both faith and practice with the pure teaching.

Because many teachings repeatedly stress the importance of the five precepts, they are not only key to ending fear and pain in this life and the next; they are also core conditions for attaining the fruit of stream-entry and the basis for living at home without fear. When a layperson possesses pure moral virtue, even if they are lacking in other respects, their relatives will still allow them to live at home and will not cast them out. This shows that moral virtue carries great weight in family and society, bringing a person a secure place of belonging and the trust of others.

VI.3 Fundamental Principles for Avoiding Evil and Suffering and the Results of Keeping Precepts

To sum up, all fundamental principles for avoiding evil and escaping suffering revolve around a single rule: with body, speech, and mind, do not perform any evil whatsoever, whether in public or in private. If one has already committed evil karma, one cannot escape the suffering it brings; no matter how one tries to conceal or deny it, the results cannot be changed.

Those who keep the precepts are precious because they possess pure moral conduct and wholesome behavior. Such precepts prevent them from being driven by unwholesome actions and from seeking excuses for their own wrongdoing. When evil actions are abandoned and precepts are carefully upheld, merit grows and pure conditions are established. At that point, a person no longer relies on clan or wealth as the basis of their standing, but instead takes moral discipline and wisdom as their true support. In this way, they can, in this life and in future lives, stay far from fear, pain, and anxiety, and gradually advance toward purity and peace.
