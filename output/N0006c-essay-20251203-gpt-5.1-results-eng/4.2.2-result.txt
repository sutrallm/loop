I. The Seriousness of Slandering Noble Ones and Practitioners

I.1 The Difference Between Worldly Misdeeds and Slandering Noble Ones

Among the various faults in the world, some, though they may bring about losses, are still relatively minor in sin and consequence. For example, when people engage in gambling, they may lose their wealth and resources, but such loss is mainly confined to the level of material possessions; the fault is comparatively small, and the resulting suffering is limited. 

By contrast, if one, with a defiled and impure mind, slanders the Well-Gone One—that is, maligns a fully awakened noble being with malicious, injurious intent—this fault is extremely grave. The unwholesome karma and suffering brought about by such slander far exceed ordinary worldly losses; the result is both deep and heavy and must never be taken lightly.

I.2 How to Assess the Act of Slandering Practitioners and the Proper Attitude

I.2.1 The Nature of the Act of Slander

In dealing with practitioners, if by speech, thought, or attitude one claims that they are driven by unwholesome desire, or holds that they are controlled by such desire, and in this way demeans and defames the mental and physical state of practitioners, then in essence this behavior is slander. 

That is to say, whenever one, without truly and accurately observing their practice, but relying only on prejudice or malice, imputes to practitioners an indulgence in unwholesome desire and asserts that they are ruled by it, this is an act of slandering practitioners.

I.2.2 The Proper Attitude Toward Practitioners

In approaching practitioners, one should stay far away from any intention to slander, and not allow doubt, contempt, or malice to grow in one’s heart and then be used as the basis for attacking them. The proper attitude is to maintain appropriate faith and respect, to generate a mind of reverence toward the practitioners’ body, speech, and mind, and to refrain from making hasty negations and insults. 

At the same time, one should recognize and acknowledge the qualities of steadiness and composure that practitioners possess, understanding the stability, tranquility, and gentleness they manifest in the course of their practice, and not use unwholesome desire and deluded views to disparage these virtues. With such understanding and attitude, one can avoid falling into the grave fault of slandering practitioners.

I.3 The Concrete Results of Slandering Practitioners

I.3.1 Physical and Mental Retribution in This Life

Harboring hostility and a slandering mind toward practitioners not only creates extremely heavy unwholesome karma on the level of morality and merit, but even in this very life can bring about obvious and concrete physical retribution. As the unwholesome karma of slander ripens, the body may develop sores that gradually grow larger—initially only a slight lesion, which over time spreads and worsens. 

These sores eventually develop into serious illnesses, finally bursting and oozing pus and blood, creating a state of unbearable suffering and even resulting in death. This process—from a minute change in the body, worsening step by step, to rupture, suppuration, and loss of life—is a major suffering that one who slanders practitioners may encounter already in this present life.

I.3.2 The Degenerate Results in Future Lives

Slandering practitioners not only gives rise in this life to severe illness and pain in the body, but also brings extremely harsh results in future lives. Because one harbors hostility and maliciously slanders practitioners, this pattern of mind and the associated karmic force will ripen after death, leading one to fall into the Red-Lotus Hell. 

The Red-Lotus Hell is an extremely painful and terrifying lower realm, experienced as the retribution for harboring enmity toward practitioners and creating karma through slander. Thus it is clear that to give rise to a slandering mind toward practitioners not only harms the purity of others’ practice, but also plants the seeds for double suffering in both this life and future lives.

II. The Faults of Stealing the Dharma to Go Forth

II.1 The Nature and Fault of Stealing the Dharma to Go Forth

Within the well-taught and complete Dharma and Vinaya, one ought to go forth according to proper procedures, and reverently uphold the precepts and the teaching. However, if someone does not follow the right path, but instead goes forth by a way that “steals the Dharma,” this is called “stealing the Dharma to go forth.” 

In other words, he does not enter the Saṅgha with a pure and upright attitude and method, but in what should be a pure field of Dharma and Vinaya, he obtains the monastic status by improper means. The nature of such behavior is deluded, because it contradicts right knowledge and right view; it is also unwise, revealing a lack of understanding of the true meaning of Dharma and Vinaya; and furthermore it is unwholesome, since it is in itself a mistaken and impure act. 

One who steals the Dharma to go forth, in the midst of a well-taught Dharma and Vinaya, twists and steals his way into the Saṅgha. This not only goes against the Dharma and Vinaya, but also constitutes a very serious moral fault.

III. Four Major Faults That Should Be Abandoned

III.1 The Faults of the Uninstructed Ordinary Person and the Resolve of the Noble Disciple

Among sentient beings there is a type known as the uninstructed ordinary person, so called because they lack a foundation of hearing and reflecting on the true Dharma and therefore cannot correctly know and see causality and the right path. If they commit certain major faults, then after death they will for that reason be born in bad destinies and undergo extremely painful consequences. 

Among these actions that lead to rebirth in bad destinies, there are four particularly grave faults: the first is slandering the Buddha—that is, disparaging, denying, and maligning the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened One; the second is slandering the true Dharma, failing to acknowledge or maliciously belittling the genuine path of liberation and the correct teaching; the third is slandering the Saṅgha, treating the monastic community with insult and contempt, thereby undermining others’ pure faith in the Saṅgha; and the fourth is breaking the precepts—failing to guard the precepts one has undertaken and deliberately violating pure discipline. If uninstructed ordinary persons commit these four faults, then after death they will be born into bad destinies.

In stark contrast, the noble disciples have abandoned all four of these faults. That is, true noble disciples do not slander the Buddha, do not slander the true Dharma, and do not slander the Saṅgha, and they carefully guard the precepts, not allowing them to be broken. Because of this, noble disciples avoid the fundamental causes that lead to bad destinies; in their conduct they cut off these four extremely heavy unwholesome karmas, thus distancing themselves from the suffering that results from slander and the breaking of precepts. 

By means of such resolve and conduct, they establish, within the law of cause and effect, a pure direction for their own future and do not align themselves with grave faults such as slander and violation of the precepts.
