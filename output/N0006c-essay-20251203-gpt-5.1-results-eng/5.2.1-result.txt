<title> A Complete Exposition on Relying on the True Dharma and Protecting the Dharma Lineage </title>
<article>
I. The Sublime Nature and Supreme Status of the True Dharma  

I.1 Drawing Near to Good Friends and First Encounter with the True Dharma  
When a practitioner is able to draw near to genuine good spiritual friends, they gradually come to understand, through ongoing contact and association, what is meant by the wholesome True Dharma. What good friends guide one toward is not merely ordinary worldly good words and good deeds, but the True Dharma that leads to the path of liberation. In this way, one comes to have a correct and clear understanding of the teachings that ought to be relied upon.  

I.2 The Source of the Noble Dharma and Ultimate Truth  
The so‑called Noble Dharma is that which is personally proclaimed by the Unsurpassed Perfectly Awakened One. Its source is not any kind of ordinary conjecture, but the realized state of one who has awakened to the ultimate truth. Such teachings stand above all sentient beings; they are the ultimate truth that transcends all beings and cannot be increased or diminished according to anyone’s likes or dislikes. Because they are ultimately real, they can guide sentient beings to open the eye of wisdom, awakening them from ignorance and confusion, so that they may contemplate themselves and the world as they truly are.  

I.3 The Supremacy of the True Dharma and Its Nectar‑like Nature  
Among all phenomena in the human and heavenly realms, the True Dharma is regarded as the most noble and most excellent. It is like the highest peak among many mountains, and like the brightest among the stars and the moon—placed in the foremost, most supreme position. At the same time, the Buddha and the True Dharma are both regarded as the foremost and unsurpassable objects of reliance among all things.  

In its very nature, such teaching is like ambrosia: utterly pure and crystal clear. Its content is free from any defilement or impurity, and can genuinely satisfy the deepest thirst of seekers of the path. Even if practitioners repeatedly listen to and cultivate these teachings, they do not grow weary of them out of familiarity, nor do they become complacent and stop after gaining some temporary benefit. Instead, they long, time and again, to hear and practice more deeply, thereby gaining a genuine and lasting inner fulfillment.  

I.4 The Completeness, Purity, and Emptiness‑Nature of the Teaching  
The True Dharma possesses the complete virtues of being “good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end”—that is, it is excellent with respect to its introduction, its process, and its result. Such teachings not only contain profound meaning, but their wording and content are harmoniously unified: there is no contradiction between their verbal expression and the principles they indicate. They display the special quality of inner and outer being in accord, of words and meaning being as one.  

What the True Dharma reveals is a complete and pure path of the holy life, free from blemish, guiding practitioners toward purity in morality (śīla), concentration (samādhi), and wisdom (prajñā).  

At the same time, practitioners should constantly abide in those profound and subtle sūtras spoken by the Buddha. These scriptures have the characteristic of emptiness: they transcend all worldly concepts and discriminations, and are not confined by the various conceptual elaborations of the world. Long abiding in them enables a practitioner’s view and mental conduct to gradually withdraw from attachment and draw near to the state of ultimate liberation.  

II. Relying on the True Dharma and Transcending Erroneous Doctrines  

II.1 Not Relying on Any Individual or Sectarian Doctrine  
In the course of practice, one should neither favor nor depend upon any individual’s or sect’s doctrines and views if these doctrines and views are teachings and opinions that lie outside of Perfect Awakening. Such teachings are in fact only another form of bondage. Any view that does not take Perfect Awakening as its root, that does not rely on the truth realized by the Buddha, may appear rich and diverse, but in reality only further binds the mind and prevents access to genuine liberation.  

Therefore, practitioners should use conformity with Perfect Awakening and accordance with the True Dharma as the fundamental criteria for what they rely upon, rather than simply attaching themselves to some famous teacher or the position of a particular sect.  

II.2 The Principle of “Rely on the Dharma, Not on the Person”  
When divergences in teaching arise in actual practice, practitioners should uphold the principle of “relying on the Dharma, not on the person,” taking the Dharma personally spoken by the Buddha as the ultimate standard. Whether it is a difference of opinion between the Buddha and the community of monks, or between the Buddha and the fourfold assembly of disciples, or even between the Buddha and all the beings in the world—whenever matters of doctrinal discernment are involved, one should take the Dharma personally spoken by the Buddha as the final basis for decision.  

In receiving faith in and confirming the correct meaning of the Dharma, one should mark truly correct teachings “with faith”—that is, confirm them by a firm inner confidence, indicating that these teachings have been accepted in one’s heart. As for well‑spoken teachings and wholesome speech, one should acknowledge them verbally as “excellent and good,” affirming their virtuous qualities. In this way, practitioners can clearly distinguish, among the many teachings, what should be believed in and rejoiced in, and will not lose their way amid chaotic and conflicting views.  

II.3 Relying on the True Dharma to Overcome Greed and Craving  
In terms of the fundamental method for overcoming greed and craving, practitioners should take the True Dharma as their sole refuge. Specifically, this means practicing in accordance with the path to Nirvāṇa taught by the Buddha, allowing this path to open and guide the orientation of one’s mind, so that it no longer flows along under the pull of craving and afflictions.  

When practitioners truly put the teachings into practice, they can, by the power of the True Dharma, cause their hearts to abide in pure joy. This joy is not sensory pleasure, but the inner peace and contentment that arise from the Dharma itself. Through this, their various worldly desires naturally grow weaker, and they gradually escape the bondage of greed.  

II.4 Fundamental Principles of Practice and the Path to Nirvāṇa  
The fundamental principle of all practice lies in “relying on the True Dharma.” A practitioner should live and think in accordance with the truth realized by the Buddha, rather than letting worldly views and ingrained habits govern their behavior. At the same time, one should carry out the instructions and guidance of the teacher, putting the True Dharma heard from the Buddha and good spiritual friends into practice in the actions of body, speech, and mind in daily life, rather than leaving it at the level of intellectual understanding and discussion.  

Throughout this process, one must maintain devout faith in the teachings, relying on the True Dharma with a firm and unwavering mind. Such faith is not blind worship; it is founded on deep confidence in the truths realized by the Buddha and on understanding the virtues of the teachings. Only in this way can practitioners truly step onto the path that leads to Nirvāṇa, so that their lives are no longer dominated by ignorance and afflictions.  

III. Revering the True Dharma and the Correct Attitude in Hearing the Dharma  

III.1 The Fundamental Spirit of Reverence for the Dharma  
A way of practice that is completely lacking in reverence ultimately brings only suffering. If one maintains a disdainful attitude toward everyone and everything, one’s mind becomes difficult to soften and cannot truly receive guidance. The correct approach is to take the True Dharma as the primary object of reverence, regarding the Buddha’s teachings as a treasure worthy of being borne upon one’s head.  

Reverence for the Dharma is a common characteristic of all awakened ones of the past, present, and future. Every truly awakened one is inseparable from respect for and protection of the True Dharma. This becomes the model that practitioners should emulate.  

In actual practice, practitioners should frequently recollect the teachings and not allow them to slip from their minds or fade with time. The motivation for hearing and cultivating the Dharma should be one’s own true benefit—that is, to escape suffering and gain happiness, to attain ultimate liberation—not to seek fame, profit, or eloquence. One should cherish a lofty aspiration, elevating the purpose of one’s life and practice to the level of liberation and awakening, rather than confining it to short‑term worldly gains. At the same time, one should constantly maintain an attitude of reverence toward the True Dharma, approaching and practicing it with humility. Only then can one truly receive its benefits.  

III.2 The Mindset and Behavior Appropriate for Hearing the Dharma  
When listening to the True Dharma, a practitioner’s mind should first maintain deep attentiveness, not letting the mind scatter among other matters. One should approach the teachings with devotion and reverence, aware that what one is hearing is the truth that leads from suffering to happiness, not ordinary conversation. The mind should be focused and collected, not allowing stray thoughts to interfere with the absorption of the teaching.  

In terms of outward behavior, one should listen with concentrated attention, committing both body and mind fully to the Dharma assembly, without arrogance or laziness, so that the teachings can be received in their entirety. “Receiving them in their entirety” does not merely mean hearing the whole discourse; it also means clearly retaining and understanding them in one’s heart, without carelessly overlooking key points. When inner attention, devotion, and reverence are in harmony with outward focused listening, the merit of hearing the Dharma is truly perfected.  

III.3 The Liberating Merit of Hearing and Practicing the True Dharma  
Hearing the True Dharma has the power to directly relieve suffering and distress. When practitioners attentively and reverently listen to the teachings, they can already experience mental happiness at the very moment of hearing. Distress and agitation are thereby reduced or even temporarily cease.  

Conversely, a person who is entirely ignorant of the True Dharma easily loses their way in suffering. Not knowing how to escape various predicaments, they can only struggle amid anxiety and fear.  

As practitioners gradually realize the true meaning of the Dharma, they find a way of liberation from the pressure of impermanence—old age, illness, and death. This liberation does not mean that the body will not age, but that, through wisdom, one thoroughly understands the reality of life and is no longer bound by fear of aging and death.  

The reason the Dharma has such power is that in essence it is utterly pure and free from blemish; its content is clear and transparent, without any defilement or impurity. Such a True Dharma can fulfill the seeker’s deep thirst for truth, enabling one to find a truly stable refuge in an unstable world.  

No matter how many times practitioners repeatedly hear and cultivate these teachings, they do not feel bored or weary, nor do they think “this is already enough” and cease their pursuit. On the contrary, the more they hear and practice, the more they can feel the nectar‑like nourishment of the Dharma, further inspiring an aspiration to continue and deepen their study and cultivation.  

IV. Teachers, Reverence, and the Community of Practice  

IV.1 The Proper Way to Revere Noble Ones  
In the presence of noble ones and genuine spiritual teachers, practitioners should express respect with body, speech, and mind. Proper forms of reverence include: upon entering a dwelling or practice place, first removing leather footwear, laying down weapons, putting away parasols, and refraining from standing or walking in an arrogant manner. When entering and leaving, one should pass through the side entrance rather than walking straight in through the main gate, as a sign of humility and respect.  

Upon seeing a noble one, one should stand at a position lower than that person, not higher, and place one’s palms together in salutation, so that the posture of the body accords with the reverence in one’s heart.  

By contrast, if someone wears leather shoes, carries a sword and holds an umbrella, and barges straight through the main door into the noble one’s residence, such behavior constitutes an offense and insult toward the noble one. This lack of reverence not only harms the person’s own store of virtuous merit but also becomes a condition for damaging the dignity of the True Dharma. Therefore it must be carefully avoided.  

IV.2 The Teacher–Disciple Lineage and Being “Born from the Dharma”  
A genuine teacher–disciple relationship is not founded on blood ties or ordinary worldly status. It is the result of being “born from the Dharma” and “transformed by the Dharma.”  

A disciple, by hearing and upholding the True Dharma, gains a new life in terms of understanding the principles of the teaching; this inner transformation of mind is what is called “being born from the Dharma.” At the same time, because of the Dharma’s guidance, the disciple undergoes change in conduct and view; this transformation brought about by the teaching is called “being transformed by the Dharma.”  

On this basis, the disciple becomes a “Dharma heir,” one who inherits the teacher’s spirit and instruction in terms of the Dharma. With the passage of time, those who truly uphold the True Dharma can “continue the Dharma lineage,” allowing the Buddha’s teaching to be transmitted generation after generation, so that the True Dharma does not quickly vanish from the world. From this it is clear that the essence of the teacher–disciple relationship is founded upon the True Dharma, not upon emotional dependence or authority.  

IV.3 Difficulties Contemporary Practitioners Face in Receiving Instruction  
In our present age, practitioners often harbor a resistant attitude toward being taught, finding it hard to accept others’ admonitions and guidance. This unwillingness to be instructed makes it difficult for practitioners to truly benefit from teachers and good spiritual friends, and hinders them from being led back to the right path when they go astray.  

When practitioners no longer open their hearts to correct instruction, the transmission of the Dharma lineage between teacher and disciple is obstructed, and the propagation of the True Dharma in the world faces ever greater difficulties.  

V. Causes and Conditions for the Survival or Disappearance of the True Dharma, and Ways to Protect It  

V.1 The Decline of Merit, the Age of the Semblance Dharma, and the Disappearance of the True Dharma  
When the merit of sentient beings gradually declines, the True Dharma tends toward disappearance. As virtuous karma weakens day by day, people’s reverence for and adherence to the teachings likewise diminishes, and the presence of the True Dharma in the world becomes progressively feeble.  

The emergence of what is called “the Age of the Semblance Dharma” is a sign that the True Dharma is vanishing. When people value outer forms and appearances while neglecting the real meaning and practice of the teachings, the external forms may still resemble those of the True Dharma, but their inner spirit has already been lost. This is the symptom of the rise of the Semblance Dharma and the gradual extinction of the True Dharma.  

V.2 The True Cause of the Disappearance of the True Dharma  
The disappearance of the True Dharma is not caused by the natural forces of earth, water, fire, and wind. The crumbling of the earth, the flooding of waters, the ravages of fire, or the violence of winds are not the fundamental causes of the Dharma’s disappearance from the world.  

What truly brings about the vanishing of the True Dharma is the arising of the ignorant. When foolish people arise who do not respect the teachings, who neither correctly understand nor practice them, and who even distort and damage the content of the True Dharma, the Dharma gradually dies out amid such a climate of delusion. Thus, whether the True Dharma survives or disappears depends primarily on the wisdom and attitude of sentient beings, not on changes in the external natural environment.  

V.3 Five Factors of Decline and Five Factors of Establishment  
The decline of the True Dharma is closely related to practitioners’ attitudes and behavior. There are five kinds of conditions that lead to decline:  

First, not respecting one’s teachers—failing to follow and practice according to the conduct of one’s teachers.  
Second, not respecting the teachings—neither following nor upholding the teaching and exposition of the Dharma, and not taking the True Dharma as the standard for one’s conduct.  
Third, not respecting the Saṅgha—failing to follow the pure conduct and harmonious regulations of the monastic community.  
Fourth, not respecting the study of the precepts—neither revering nor actually observing the discipline.  
Fifth, not respecting the practice of meditation—neither valuing meditative cultivation nor matching it with practical effort.  

These five attitudes of disrespect and non‑compliance directly undermine the foundation of the True Dharma in the world, causing the lineage to gradually decline.  

Opposed to these are five conditions that can establish and protect the True Dharma:  

First, respecting one’s teachers and following their instruction in actual conduct.  
Second, respecting the teachings and living in accordance with them, without violating their spirit.  
Third, respecting the Saṅgha and following the community’s pure and harmonious way of life.  
Fourth, respecting the study of the precepts, not only honoring the discipline but diligently observing and cultivating it.  
Fifth, respecting the practice of meditation, actively training in concentration and insight.  

When these five attitudes of respect and compliance are widely practiced, the True Dharma can remain firm and endure long in the world.  

V.4 Choosing Between Profound Teachings and Worldly Discourse  
A major cause of the disappearance of the True Dharma lies in people’s mistaken choices between profound teachings and worldly discourse. When confronted with teachings that are deep and truly oriented toward liberation, if one is unwilling to listen to them properly, refuses to listen attentively, does not incline the mind to understand, and never reflects that these teachings ought to be upheld and thoroughly known, then one has, subjectively, cut off one’s own connection with the True Dharma. This attitude causes the Dharma to lose its influence in that person and even in the entire group.  

Yet that same person may display a completely different attitude toward worldly talk and non‑Buddhist teachings. If they are fond of eloquent and ornate doctrines from outside the Dharma, and are willing to hear and listen attentively to such teachings, inclining their minds to understand and reflecting that these worldly forms of discourse ought to be upheld and thoroughly known, then their minds will be firmly drawn by these views and will stray ever further from the True Dharma. Outwardly, such a person may appear learned and well‑spoken, but in reality they are contributing to the decline of the True Dharma.  

V.5 The Inner Attitudinal Roots of the Disappearance of the True Dharma  
On a deeper level, the fundamental cause of the disappearance of the True Dharma is the wrong attitude people hold when facing profound teachings. When beings are unwilling to listen carefully to teachings of true depth, refuse to listen attentively, do not incline their minds to understand, and do not reflect that these teachings ought to be upheld and thoroughly known, the True Dharma gradually disappears amid such indifference and negligence.  

Conversely, if one adopts a correct attitude toward profound teachings—listening to them properly, hearing them with full attention, inclining the mind toward understanding, and reflecting that such teachings should indeed be upheld and fully known—then the True Dharma can, through this attitude, be preserved and spread.  

Therefore, the practical key to protecting the True Dharma lies in whether practitioners are willing to open their hearts to profound teachings, to receive them with concentration and reverence, and to firmly establish in their minds the recognition that “these teachings are to be upheld and thoroughly understood.” When such an attitude becomes widespread, the True Dharma can long remain in the world and will not quickly fall into decline.  

VI. Norms for Expounding the Teachings and the Way of Harmony  

VI.1 Correct and Incorrect Attitudes in Expounding the Teachings  
When expounding the teachings, one must first possess the right attitude. For teachings that are spoken in accordance with reason and in harmony with truth, one should give affirmation, approval, and rejoicing. Whether it is a good teaching one oneself presents, or wholesome speech expressed by others, as long as it accords with reason and the True Dharma, one should feel joy and support it.  

The ultimate aim of such an attitude is to bring about a state of harmony, delight, and non‑contention, enabling everyone to regard one another with friendliness and to establish a pure consensus within the True Dharma, rather than mutual exclusion.  

Opposed to this is an incorrect attitude in expounding the teachings. If someone refuses to affirm or rejoice in teachings that are spoken in accord with reason and the Dharma, but instead inwardly expects to stir up conflict, clamor, and debate, the inevitable result will be mutual verbal attacks and the destruction of harmony. Such an attitude not only hinders the spread of the True Dharma but also fills the practicing community with strife, thereby weakening people’s confidence in and closeness to the Dharma.  

VI.2 The Virtues of the Teaching as Good in the Beginning, Middle, and End  
From the perspective of the teachings themselves, they possess the qualities of being good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. That is, the teachings can awaken wholesome minds at the outset, guide right conduct in the process, and bring about wholesome results in the end.  

Such Dharma not only contains rich and profound meaning; its words and content are also harmoniously unified. Whether in its verbal formulation or its doctrinal substance, each aspect confirms the other, and no contradiction appears between words and meaning.  

Moreover, the True Dharma guides one along a complete and pure path of the holy life, free from any flaw. This path encompasses all elements of practice—morality, concentration, and wisdom—and leads beings away from defilement and delusion toward purity and liberation. Whoever practices in accordance with these teachings is living a life that embodies pure and complete virtue.  

VII. The Direction of Practice: Abiding in Profound Sūtras  

VII.1 Abiding in the Buddha’s Sūtras on Emptiness  
In terms of the overall direction of practice, practitioners should constantly abide in those profound sūtras spoken by the Buddha. These scriptures take emptiness as their defining characteristic; they transcend all worldly concepts and do not fall into the various conceptual elaborations and discriminations of the world.  

By long abiding—in contemplation and practice—in such sūtras, practitioners gradually relinquish attachment to self and to all phenomena, and withdraw from various wrong views. In this way, the True Dharma is not only preserved in written form and memory but is also genuinely protected and perpetuated in the embodied practice of practitioners themselves.
