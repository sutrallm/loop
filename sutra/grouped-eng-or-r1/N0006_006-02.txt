2. Brahma Chapter  

(11) Constant Child  

1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagaha by the Sappinī River.  

2. Then, Brahma Constant Child, illuminating the Sappinī Riverbank at dawn, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage and stood to one side.  

3. Standing to one side, Brahma Constant Child recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:  
Foremost among men by lineage,  
Supreme among the Kshatriyas,  
Accomplished in wisdom and conduct—  
He stands unrivaled among gods and humans.  

4. After speaking, Brahma Constant Child received praise from the Teacher.  

5. Knowing his words were commended by the Teacher, Brahma Constant Child paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and departed.  

(12) Second: Devadatta  

1. At that time, not long after Devadatta had departed, the Blessed One was dwelling on Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagaha.  

2. Then Brahma Sahaṁpati, illuminating all of Vulture Peak at dawn, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage and stood to one side.  

3. Standing to one side, Brahma Sahaṁpati recited this verse regarding Devadatta in the presence of the Blessed One:  
Like bamboo and reeds that perish when bearing fruit,  
Like a donkey dying in childbirth—  
So too, misdeeds destroy the reputation of the wicked.  

(13) Third: Andhakavinda  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Andhakavinda in Magadha.  

2. One night, while sitting outdoors in the dark, rain fell.  

3. Then Brahma Sahaṁpati, illuminating all of Andhakavinda at dawn, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage and stood to one side.  

4. Standing to one side, Brahma Sahaṁpati recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:  
Dwelling far from villages,  
Wandering free from bonds—  
If discontent arises, guard your senses.  
Mindful among the Sangha,  
Begging from house to house—  
Guarded in senses and heedful,  
Dwelling far from villages.  
Fearless and liberated!  
Recall the danger of serpents,  
Thunder rumbling, lightning flashing—  
In the dark night, the monk  
Sits alone, free from fear.  
Truly, I have seen it with my own eyes—  
Not mere hearsay—  
Under one teaching,  
Thousands shed death,  
Five hundred more,  
And those beyond count—  
All entered the stream,  
Transcending the animal realm.  
Others too, gaining merits—  
Their numbers I cannot reckon,  
Lest I be accused of falsehood.  

(14) Fourth: Aranavethi  

1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthī.  

2. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”  

3. “Venerable sir!” replied the bhikkhus.  

4. The Blessed One said:  

5. “Bhikkhus, long ago there was King Aranavā. He ruled the city of Aranavethi. At that time, the Blessed One Sikhī, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One, dwelled in Aranavethi.  

6. Bhikkhus, the Blessed One Sikhī had two chief disciples: Bhikkhus Abhibhū and Sambhava.  

7. Then the Blessed One Sikhī addressed Bhikkhu Abhibhū: ‘Come, brahmin. It is time to approach the Brahma realm for alms.’  

8. ‘Yes, Venerable Sir,’ replied Bhikkhu Abhibhū.  

9. Then, bhikkhus, the Blessed One Sikhī and Bhikkhu Abhibhū, as swiftly as a strong man bends or stretches his arm, vanished from Aranavethi and reappeared in the Brahma realm.  

10. The Blessed One Sikhī said to Bhikkhu Abhibhū: ‘Brahmin, teach the Dhamma to Brahma, Brahma’s ministers, and Brahma’s assembly.’  

11. ‘Yes, Venerable Sir,’ replied Bhikkhu Abhibhū. He taught them the Dhamma, exhorted, inspired, and gladdened them.  

12. Then the Brahma, his ministers, and assembly whispered complaints: ‘How strange! A disciple teaches in the presence of his master!’  

13. The Blessed One Sikhī said to Bhikkhu Abhibhū: ‘Brahmin, the Brahma and his ministers are murmuring. Therefore, inspire them further.’  

14. ‘Yes, Venerable Sir,’ replied Bhikkhu Abhibhū. He manifested forms, became invisible, showed his lower body, then his upper body.  

15. Astonished, the Brahma and his assembly exclaimed: ‘The ascetic’s power and majesty are wondrous!’  

16. Bhikkhu Abhibhū said to Sikhī: ‘Venerable Sir, let the entire bhikkhu Sangha know that I will make my voice heard throughout a thousand worlds from the Brahma realm.’  

17. ‘Brahmin, do so now.’  

18. Then Bhikkhu Abhibhū stood in the Brahma realm and recited this verse:  
Strive diligently,  
Follow the Buddha’s teaching.  
Shatter Māra’s hordes  
As an elephant crushes a reed hut.  
Abiding heedfully in this Dhamma and discipline,  
You will escape birth and death,  
Reaching suffering’s end.  

19. Having inspired them, the Blessed One Sikhī and Bhikkhu Abhibhū vanished from the Brahma realm and reappeared in Aranavethi.  

20. The Blessed One Sikhī asked the bhikkhus: ‘Did you hear Bhikkhu Abhibhū’s verse?’  

21. ‘Yes, Venerable Sir.’  

22.–23. ‘What did he recite?’ They repeated the verse.  

24. ‘Well said, bhikkhus! You heard correctly.’  

25. The bhikkhus rejoiced at his words.  

(15) Fifth: Parinibbāna  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was entering Parinibbāna between the twin sāla trees in the Malla’s Sāl Grove near Kusinārā.  

2. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, I exhort you: All conditioned things are subject to decay. Strive diligently!” These were the Tathāgata’s final words.  

3. Then the Blessed One entered the first jhāna, emerged, and entered the second jhāna. Emerging, he entered the third, then the fourth jhāna. From the fourth jhāna, he entered the base of infinite space, then the base of infinite consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither perception nor non-perception.  

4. Reversing the order, he returned through the jhānas, then passed into Parinibbāna from the fourth jhāna.  

5. At his Parinibbāna, Brahma Sahaṁpati recited:  
All beings in this world—  
Sooner or later, this body they discard.  
The Teacher, unequalled in power,  
The Enlightened One, the Tathāgata,  
Has attained Parinibbāna.  

6. Sakka, ruler of gods, recited:  
All conditioned things are impermanent,  
Arising and ceasing.  
Having arisen, they pass away—  
Their pacification is bliss.  

7. Venerable Ānanda recited:  
Terror struck me,  
My hair stood on end—  
The One of all sublime marks,  
The Awakened One, has attained Parinibbāna.  

8. Venerable Anuruddha recited:  
No in-breath, no out-breath—  
The mind steadfastly still.  
Free from craving, the Sage has peace.  
Enduring death’s pangs with unshaken heart,  
His liberation is like a lamp’s extinction.  

This summary:  
Constant Child Brahma, Devadatta second,  
Andhakavinda third, Aranavethi fourth,  
With Parinibbāna fifth—thus the five Brahma discourses.
