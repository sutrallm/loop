4. Devadaha Vagga  

134. First: Devadaha  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans in the Sakyan town named Devadaha.  

2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, I do not say that all monks must be heedful regarding the six sense bases. Nor do I say that all monks need not be heedful regarding the six sense bases.  

3. Monks, those monks who are arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and are completely liberated through final knowledge—these monks, I say, need not be heedful regarding the six sense bases. Why is that?  

4. They are already heedful. They cannot be heedless.  

5. Monks, as for those monks who are trainees, who have not attained their ideal but dwell aspiring for the supreme security from bondage—these monks, I say, must be heedful regarding the six sense bases. Why is that?  

6. Monks, when pleasant or unpleasant forms cognizable by the eye come into contact, and such contact strikes their minds, they do not cling to them. Since their minds are not clinging, they arouse effort without wavering, establish mindfulness without loss, relax the body without agitation, and concentrate the mind one-pointedly. Monks, seeing the fruit of heedfulness, I declare that these monks must be heedful regarding the six sense bases.  

7–11. Monks, when pleasant or unpleasant sounds... smells... tastes... touches... mental phenomena cognizable by the mind come into contact, and such contact strikes their minds, they do not cling to them. Since their minds are not clinging, they arouse effort without wavering, establish mindfulness without loss, relax the body without agitation, and concentrate the mind one-pointedly. Monks, seeing the fruit of heedfulness, I declare that these monks must be heedful regarding the six sense bases."  

135. Second: Clinging  

2. "Monks, this is your gain, your good fortune. Monks, you have obtained the opportunity to live the holy life.  

3. Monks, I have seen a realm named the six sense bases’ domain of hell. There, whatever forms one sees with the eye are only undesirable, not desirable; only unlovely, not lovely; only disagreeable, not agreeable. Whatever sounds one hears with the ear... Whatever smells one senses with the nose... Whatever tastes one savors with the tongue... Whatever touches one feels with the body... Whatever mental phenomena one cognizes with the mind are only undesirable, not desirable; only unlovely, not lovely; only disagreeable, not agreeable. Monks, this is your gain, your good fortune. Monks, you have obtained the opportunity to live the holy life.  

4. Monks, I have seen a realm named the six sense bases’ domain of heaven. There, whatever forms one sees with the eye are only desirable, not undesirable; only lovely, not unlovely; only agreeable, not disagreeable. Whatever sounds one hears with the ear... Whatever smells one senses with the nose... Whatever tastes one savors with the tongue... Whatever touches one feels with the body... Whatever mental phenomena one cognizes with the mind are only desirable, not undesirable; only lovely, not unlovely; only agreeable, not disagreeable. Monks, this is your gain, your good fortune. Monks, you have obtained the opportunity to live the holy life."  

136. Third: Non-Clinging  

2. "Monks, gods and humans delight in forms, are stimulated by forms, and suffer due to the change, separation, and ending of forms. Monks, gods and humans delight in sounds... smells... tastes... touches... mental phenomena, are stimulated by phenomena, and suffer due to the change, separation, and ending of phenomena.  

3. Monks, the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One, has truly understood the arising and passing away, the allure, danger, and escape regarding forms. He does not delight in forms, is not stimulated by forms, and thus dwells at ease amid the change, separation, and ending of forms."  

4. The Blessed One spoke thus. Having said this, the Teacher further said:  
(1) "Forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and all phenomena, deemed pleasant, lovely, and agreeable, are limited.  
(2) In the world of gods and humans, these are considered bliss. Their cessation is seen as suffering by the wise.  
(3) The destruction of craving is seen as bliss by the noble ones, but the worldlings see it oppositely.  
(4) What others call bliss, the noble ones deem suffering; what they call suffering, the noble ones know as bliss.  
(5) The nature of contact is hard to understand. The deluded, shrouded by defilements, dwell in darkness—the blind do not see.  
(6) For the virtuous, the path to Nibbāna is revealed; the wise see light and, mastering the Dhamma, draw near.  
(7) Bound by craving for existence, swept by the stream of existence—those entering Māra’s domain do not know this truth.  
(8) Who besides the noble ones can rightly know the path to Nibbāna? Those who fully understand it, freed from taints, reach Parinibbāna.  

5. Monks, gods and humans delight in forms... (as above)... thus dwell in suffering.  

6. Monks, the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One... (as above)... dwells at ease."  

137. Fourth: The Malicious (1)  

2. "Monks, abandon what does not belong to you. Abandoning it will bring you welfare and happiness.  

3–8. Monks, what does not belong to you? The eye does not belong to you—abandon it. Abandoning it will bring welfare and happiness. The ear... nose... tongue... body... mind does not belong to you—abandon it. Abandoning it will bring welfare and happiness.  

9. Monks, suppose people were to carry off, burn, or do as they please with the grass, sticks, and leaves in this Jeta’s Grove. Would you think: ‘They are carrying us off, burning us, doing as they please with us’?"  
"No, Venerable Sir."  
"Why not?"  
"Venerable Sir, those things are not our self nor belonging to our self."  

10. "Similarly, monks, the eye... ear... nose... tongue... body... mind does not belong to you. Abandon it... sounds... smells... tastes... touches... mental phenomena..."  

138. Fifth: The Malicious (2)  

2. "Monks, abandon what does not belong to you. Abandoning it will bring welfare and happiness.  

3–8. Monks, what does not belong to you? Forms do not belong to you—abandon them. Abandoning them will bring welfare and happiness. Sounds... smells... tastes... touches... mental phenomena..."  

9. "Monks, suppose people... (as above)...  

10. Similarly, monks, forms... sounds... smells... tastes... touches... mental phenomena..."  

139. Sixth: Internal Cause (1)  

3. "Monks, the eye is impermanent. The cause and condition for the arising of the eye is also impermanent. How could the eye, arisen from what is impermanent, be permanent?  

4–8. The ear... nose... tongue... body... mind... (as above)...  

9. Monks, seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye... and is thereby freed."  

140. Seventh: Internal Cause (2)  

3. "Monks, the eye is suffering. The cause and condition for the arising of the eye is also suffering. How could the eye, arisen from what is suffering, be pleasant?  

4–8. The ear... (as above)...  

9. Monks, seeing thus... (as above)."  

141. Eighth: Internal Cause (3)  

3. "Monks, the eye is not-self. The cause and condition for the arising of the eye is also not-self. How could the eye, arisen from what is not-self, be self?  

4–8. The ear... (as above)...  

9. Monks, seeing thus... (as above)."  

142. Ninth: External Cause (1)  

3. "Monks, forms are impermanent. The cause and condition for the arising of forms is also impermanent. How could forms, arisen from what is impermanent, be permanent?  

4–8. Sounds... smells... tastes... touches... mental phenomena... (as above)...  

9. Monks, seeing thus... (as above)."  

143. Tenth: External Cause (2)  

3. "Monks, forms are suffering. The cause and condition for the arising of forms is also suffering. How could forms, arisen from what is suffering, be pleasant?  

4–8. Sounds... (as above)...  

9. Monks, seeing thus... (as above)."  

144. Eleventh: External Cause (3)  

3. "Monks, forms are not-self. The cause and condition for the arising of forms is also not-self. How could forms, arisen from what is not-self, be self?  

4–8. Sounds... (as above)...  

9. Monks, seeing thus... (as above)."
