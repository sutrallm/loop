3. Nutriment  

(73) First. Taste  

1-2  
[Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”—“Venerable Sir!” those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:]  

3  
“Bhikkhus, the uninstructed ordinary person does not understand form’s gratification, danger, and escape as it really is.  

4-6  
He does not understand feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

7  
He does not understand consciousness’s gratification, danger, and escape as it really is.  

8-12  
But, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple understands form’s gratification, danger, and escape... feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness’s gratification, danger, and escape as it really is.”  

(74) Second. Origin (1)  

1-2  
[Thus have I heard... at Savatthī... The Blessed One said:]  

3  
“Bhikkhus, the uninstructed ordinary person does not understand form’s origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape...  

4-6  
feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

7  
He does not understand consciousness’s origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape as it really is.  

8  
But, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple understands form’s origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape...  

9-11  
feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

12  
He understands consciousness’s origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape as it really is.”  

(75) Third. Origin (2)  

1-2  
[Thus... at Savatthī...]  

3  
“Bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple understands form’s origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape...  

4-6  
feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

7  
He understands consciousness’s origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape as it really is.”  

(76) Fourth. Arahant (1)  

1-2  
[Thus... at Savatthī...]  

3  
“Bhikkhus, form is impermanent. What is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering is nonself. What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’  

4-6  
Feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

7  
Consciousness is impermanent... This is not my self.  

8  
Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with form... feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness.  

9  
Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. In liberation, the knowledge arises: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’  

10  
Up to the realm of beings, even up to the peak of existence, bhikkhus, that person is foremost, that person is supreme in the world: such is the arahant.”  

11  
The Blessed One said this. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said:  

12  
“(1) Happy indeed the arahant,  
With craving’s root destroyed;  
Cut off the conceit ‘I am,’  
Shattered delusion’s net.  

(2) Unshaken, beyond dust,  
No stains linger in the mind;  
In the world he shines supreme,  
Pure, equal to Brahmā.  

(3) Fully understanding the five aggregates,  
He perfects the sevenfold good;  
Praised by the wise,  
He is the Buddha’s true son.  

(4) Endowed with seven treasures,  
Trained in the threefold training,  
He roams freely, great hero,  
Fearless, unshaken.  

(5) Blessed with tenfold strength,  
Like an elephant in battle;  
Foremost in the world,  
He leaves craving behind.  

(6) The final body borne,  
No future becoming awaits;  
The holy life fulfilled,  
No ties remain.  

(7) Freed from all illusions,  
Transcending birth and death;  
Tamed, he stands in mastery,  
Supreme in all the world.  

(8) In all directions—  
Above, below, around—  
The Lion’s roar resounds:  
‘The Buddha, unequalled!’”  

(77) Fifth. Arahant (2)  

1-2  
[Thus... at Savatthī...]  

3  
“Bhikkhus, one should see as it really is with correct wisdom: form is impermanent... displeasure, [seeing it as] ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’  

4-7  
One should see thus with feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness...  

8  
Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with form... feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness...  

9-10  
[Same as §9-10 of previous sutta.]”  

(78) Sixth. Lion (1)  

1-2  
[Thus... at Savatthī...]  

3  
“Bhikkhus, the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his lair in the evening. He stretches, surveys the four quarters three times, roars his lion’s roar three times, then sets out to hunt.  

4  
When animals hear the lion’s roar, terror, trembling, and fear arise. Those in burrows hide; aquatic ones dive; forest-dwellers flee; birds take to the sky.  

5  
Even royal elephants bound by strong ropes break free in panic, soiling themselves and fleeing.  

6  
So mighty is the lion’s power, dominance, and majesty among beasts.  

7  
Similarly, bhikkhus, when the Tathāgata arises in the world—arahant, fully enlightened—he teaches Dhamma: such is form, its origin, cessation...  

8  
Long-lived deities, dwelling in bliss for ages, hear the Tathāgata’s Dhamma. Terror strikes them: ‘Impermanent we thought eternal; unstable we thought secure... Ourselves, subject to formations!’  

9  
Such is the Tathāgata’s power, dominance, and majesty in the world.”  

10  
The Blessed One said this. The Fortunate One, the Teacher, added:  

“(1) The Buddha, knowing truth,  
Proclaims Dhamma to gods and men:  
‘Ceasing, arising of form,  
The Noble Eightfold Path to peace.’  

(2) The form’s destruction taught,  
Outshining aging, death;  
Long-lived devas tremble,  
Like beasts at lion’s roar.  

(3) ‘Ah! We’re not exempt,  
Bound by impermanent form!’  
Hearing the Victor’s words,  
They transcend misery.”  

(79) Seventh. Lion (2)  

1-2  
[Thus... at Savatthī...]  

3  
“Bhikkhus, ascetics and Brahmins who recollect past lives recollect the five aggregates or one among them.  

4  
Thinking, ‘I had such form in the past,’ they recollect form... ‘I had such feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness.’  

5  
Why is it called ‘form’? Because it is afflicted (ruppati). Afflicted by cold, heat, hunger, thirst, insects, snakes...  

6  
‘Feeling’: because it feels... pleasure, pain, neither-pain-nor-pleasure.  

7  
‘Perception’: because it perceives... colors, etc.  

8  
‘Volitional formations’: because they construct conditioned things... activating form, feeling, etc.  

9  
‘Consciousness’: because it cognizes... sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, etc.  

10-15  
A noble disciple reflects: ‘I am consumed by form... feeling... perception... formations... consciousness in past, present, future.’ Disenchanted, he becomes free.  

16-25  
By seeing the impermanent, suffering nature of the aggregates, he realizes, ‘This is not mine...’  

26-37  
He diminishes, abandons, retreats, and is liberated. Such a mind is unshaken, revered by gods.”  

38  
“Homage to the noble one,  
Highest among men!  
Your meditation’s sphere  
Transcends our grasp, O sage!”  

(80) Eighth. Alms  

1  
Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.  

2  
After admonishing the Saṅgha, he went alone for alms.  

3  
Returning, he entered a forest for the day.  

4-7  
Reflecting that new monks might stray without him, he resolved to return.  

8-16  
Brahmā Sahampati urged the Buddha to guide them. The Buddha agreed.  

17-30  
Addressing the monks, he taught the pitfalls of sensuality and the value of dispassion.  

31-37  
By thoroughly analyzing the aggregates’ impermanence, one gains liberation.  

(81) Ninth. Pāṭaligāma  

1  
At Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park...  

2-8  
The Buddha left without informing attendants. Ānanda explained this was his habit.  

9-30  
Teaching the monks, the Buddha explained how ignorance and craving lead to identity views.  

31  
Only by fully understanding dependent arising is liberation achieved.  

(82) Tenth. Full Moon  

1-14  
On a full-moon night, a monk asked about the five aggregates: their roots, relation to clinging, and the cessation of identity-view.  

15-21  
The Buddha refuted a monk’s doubt about “who” experiences kamma by analyzing the aggregates’ impermanent nature.  

22  
Concluding, the Buddha summarized the third chapter.  

**Third Chapter on Nutriment**  
Topics: Taste, two on Origin, two on Arahant, two on Lion, Alms, Pāṭaligāma, Full Moon.  

This concludes the Third Chapter.
