2. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One...  

3. Seated to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘ignorance, ignorance.’ What is ignorance, and how is one ignorant?"  

4. "Bhikkhu, here an uninstructed ordinary person does not understand form, its origin, its cessation, or the way leading to its cessation.  

5.—8. They do not understand feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness, its origin, its cessation, or the way leading to its cessation.  

9. This is called ignorance, and thus one is ignorant."  

114. 2. Knowledge (Bhikkhu)  

1.—3. At Sāvatthī... Seated to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘knowledge, knowledge.’ What is knowledge, and how is one knowledgeable?"  

4. "Bhikkhu, here a learned noble disciple understands form, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation.  

5.—8. They understand feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation.  

9. This is called knowledge, and thus one is knowledgeable."  

115. 3. The Dhamma Speaker (1)  

1.—2. At Sāvatthī...  

3. Seated to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said, ‘a Dhamma speaker, a Dhamma speaker.’ How is one a Dhamma speaker?"  

4. "Bhikkhu, if a bhikkhu teaches for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation regarding form, they may be called a Dhamma-speaking bhikkhu. If they practice for disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation regarding form, they may be called one practicing in accordance with the Dhamma. If, through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, and non-clinging, they are liberated, they may be called one attained to Nibbāna in this very life.  

5.—7. Regarding feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

8. If a bhikkhu teaches for disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation regarding consciousness, they may be called a Dhamma speaker. If they practice for disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation regarding consciousness, they may be called one practicing in accordance with the Dhamma. If, through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, and non-clinging, they are liberated, they may be called one attained to Nibbāna in this very life."  

116. 4. The Dhamma Speaker (2)  

1. At Sāvatthī...

4.—6. Regarding feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

7. Regarding consciousness... they may be called one attained to Nibbāna in this very life."  

117. 5. Bonds  

1.—2. At Sāvatthī...  

3. "Bhikkhus, there is an uninstructed ordinary person... who regards form as self, self as possessing form, form as in self, or self as in form. They are bound by the bondage of form, internally and externally. Not crossing over, they are born bound, die bound, and pass from this world to the next bound.  

4.—6. They regard feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

7. They regard consciousness as self... Such a person is bound by consciousness...  

8. But a learned noble disciple does not regard form as self... They are freed from bondage, cross over, and are liberated from suffering entirely.  

9.—12. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness."  

118. 6. Liberation (1)  

1.—2. "Bhikkhus, do you regard form as ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?" "No, venerable sir." "Good! View this with right wisdom: form is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.  

3.—6. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness.  

7. Seeing thus... they are liberated and no longer subject to rebirth."  

119. 7. Liberation (2)  

1.—2. "Bhikkhus, do you regard form as ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self’?" "Yes, venerable sir." "Good! View this with right wisdom...  

3.—6. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness.  

7. Seeing thus... they are liberated."  

120. 8. Bonds and Things Bound  

1.—2. At Sāvatthī... "Bhikkhus, I will teach the bonds and things bound.  

3.—8. Form is a thing bound; desire and lust for it is the bond. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness.  

9. These are the bonds and things bound."  

121. 9. Grasping  

1.—2. At Sāvatthī... "Bhikkhus, I will teach the things grasped and grasping.  

3.—8. Form is a thing grasped; desire and lust for it is grasping. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness.  

9. These are the things grasped and grasping."  

122. 10. Virtue  

1. At Bārāṇasī, in the Deer Park...  

2.—3. Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita asked Venerable Sāriputta: "Friend, what should a virtuous bhikkhu attend to?"  

4. "A virtuous bhikkhu should attend to the five aggregates subject to clinging as impermanent, suffering, a disease, a tumor, a thorn, a calamity, alien, dissolving, empty, and nonself.  

5.—15. Progressively, a stream-enterer... once-returner... non-returner... arahant attends similarly.  

16.—18. For an arahant, attending to the aggregates fosters pleasant dwelling here and now and mindfulness-full awareness."  

123. 11. Learned  

[Similar context as previous, abbreviated.]  

124. 12. Kappa (1)

3.—7. "By viewing all past, future, present form... feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness as ‘Not mine, not I, not my self.’  

8.—9. Thus, conceit is abandoned."  

125. 13. Kappa (2)  

1.—2. "How does one transcend all notions and attain peace?"  

3.—7. "By viewing all form... consciousness as ‘Not mine, not I, not my self,’ and being liberated without clinging.  

8. Thus, the mind transcends all signs and is liberated."
