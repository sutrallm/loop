“Bhikkhus, there are five powers. What are the five powers?...  
3. Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges River flows eastward, inclines eastward, approaches the east, so too, a bhikkhu who cultivates the five powers extensively flows toward Nirvana, inclines toward Nirvana, approaches Nirvana. Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu cultivate the five powers and, by cultivating them extensively, flow toward Nirvana, incline toward Nirvana, approach Nirvana?  
4. Bhikkhus, here a bhikkhu cultivates the power of faith for the complete subduing of desire, the complete subduing of hatred, the complete subduing of delusion. He cultivates the power of effort... the power of mindfulness... the power of concentration... the power of wisdom. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who thus cultivates the five powers and cultivates them extensively flows toward Nirvana, inclines toward Nirvana, approaches Nirvana.”
