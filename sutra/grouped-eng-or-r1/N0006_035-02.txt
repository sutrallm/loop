2. Chapter of Pairs

13. First Discourse: Due to Perfect Enlightenment (1)  

1. Savatthi.  
2. "Monks, before my perfect enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisattva not yet fully enlightened, this thought arose in me: 'What is the gratification of the eye? What is its danger? What is the escape from it? What is the gratification of the ear... nose... tongue... body... mind? What is its danger? What is the escape from it?'  
3–7. Then, monks, this thought arose in me: 'The pleasure and joy arising from the eye is the gratification of the eye. That the eye is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change is the danger of the eye. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for the eye is the escape from the eye. Similarly: ear... nose... tongue... body...  
8. The pleasure and joy arising from the mind is the gratification of the mind. That the mind is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change is the danger of the mind. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for the mind is the escape from the mind.'  
9. Monks, so long as I did not truly know these internal six sense bases as they are—their gratification as gratification, their danger as danger, their escape as escape—I did not declare to the world with its devas, Maras, Brahmas, ascetics, and brahmins, humans and gods that I had realized unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.  
10. But when I truly knew these internal six sense bases as they are—their gratification as gratification, their danger as danger, their escape as escape—then I declared to the world... that I had realized unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.  
11. Then the knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; there is now no renewed existence.'"  

14. Second Discourse: Due to Perfect Enlightenment (2)  

2. "Monks, before my perfect enlightenment... this thought arose in me: 'What is the gratification of forms? What is their danger? What is the escape from them? What is the gratification of sounds... smells... tastes... tactile objects... mental phenomena? What is their danger? What is the escape from them?'  
3. Then, monks, this thought arose in me: 'The pleasure and joy arising from forms is the gratification of forms. That forms are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change is the danger of forms. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for forms is the escape from forms.  
4–7. Similarly: sounds... smells... tastes... tactile objects...  
8. The pleasure and joy arising from mental phenomena is the gratification of mental phenomena. That mental phenomena are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change is the danger of mental phenomena. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for mental phenomena is the escape from mental phenomena.'  
9–10. Monks, so long as I did not truly know these external six sense bases as they are... (as above)... Then I declared...  
11. Then the knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Unshakable is my liberation of mind...'"  

15. Third Discourse: Due to Gratification (1)  

2. "Monks, I sought the gratification in the eye. Having discovered the gratification in the eye, I clearly saw with wisdom the gratification in the eye. Monks, I sought the danger in the eye. Having discovered the danger in the eye, I clearly saw with wisdom the danger in the eye. Monks, I sought the escape from the eye. Having discovered the escape from the eye, I clearly saw with wisdom the escape from the eye.  
3–6. Similarly: ear... nose... tongue... body...  
7. Monks, I sought the gratification in the mind... danger... escape...  
8–9. So long as I did not truly know these internal six sense bases as they are... (as above)... Then I declared...  
10. Then the knowledge and vision arose in me..."  

16. Fourth Discourse: Due to Gratification (2)  

2. "Monks, I sought the gratification in forms... (as above)...  
3–6. Similarly: sounds... smells... tastes... tactile objects...  
7. Monks, I sought the gratification in mental phenomena...  
8–9. So long as I did not truly know these external six sense bases... (as above)...  
10. Then the knowledge and vision arose in me..."  

17. Fifth Discourse: If There Were Not (1)  

2. "Monks, if there were no gratification in the eye, beings would not become enamored with it. But because there is gratification in the eye, beings become enamored with it.  
3. If there were no danger in the eye, beings would not be repelled by it. But because there is danger in the eye, beings are repelled by it.  
4. If there were no escape from the eye, beings could not escape from it. But because there is an escape from the eye, beings escape from it.  
5–16. Similarly: ear... nose... tongue... body... mind...  
17–19. If there were no gratification... danger... escape... in the mind...  
20. Monks, so long as beings do not truly know these internal six sense bases as they are... they are not freed from suffering...  
21. But when beings truly know... they are freed..."  

18. Sixth Discourse: If There Were Not (2)  

2. "Monks, if there were no gratification in forms... (as above)...  
3–16. Similarly: sounds... smells... tastes... tactile objects...  
17–19. If there were no gratification... danger... escape... in mental phenomena...  
20–21. So long as beings do not truly know these external six sense bases... (as above)..."  

19. Seventh Discourse: Because of Delight (1)  

2. "Monks, one who delights in the eye delights in suffering. One who delights in suffering is not freed from suffering... Similarly: ear... nose... tongue... body... mind...  
3. One who does not delight in the eye does not delight in suffering. One who does not delight in suffering is freed from suffering..."  

20. Eighth Discourse: Because of Delight (2)  

2. "Monks, one who delights in forms... sounds... smells... tastes... tactile objects... mental phenomena delights in suffering. One who delights in suffering... is not freed...  
3. One who does not delight... mental phenomena... is freed..."  

21. Ninth Discourse: Because of Arising (1)  

2. "Monks, the arising, persistence, birth, and manifestation of the eye is the arising of suffering, the persistence of disease, the manifestation of aging and death.  
3–7. Similarly: ear... nose... tongue... body... mind...  
8–13. The cessation... of the eye... mind is the cessation of suffering..."  

22. Tenth Discourse: Because of Arising (2)  

2. "Monks, the arising... of forms... (as above)...  
3–7. Similarly: sounds... smells... tastes... tactile objects... mental phenomena...  
8–13. The cessation... of forms... mental phenomena is the cessation of suffering..."  

End of the Chapter of Pairs II.  

Recapitulation:  
Two on enlightenment, two on gratification, two on "if there were not," two on delight, two on arising—thus the chapter is called the Chapter of Pairs.
