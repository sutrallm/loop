1. The Section with Verses [1] First Absorption 3. "Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. What three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Bhikkhus, these are the three feelings. 4. (1) A disciple of the Buddha, endowed with stability, clear comprehension, and mindfulness, knows feelings and the arising of all feelings. (2) Knows the cessation of these feelings and the path leading to their cessation. Through the cessation of feelings, a bhikkhu becomes desireless and enters complete quenching."  

[2] Second: Pleasure 3. "Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. What three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Bhikkhus, these are the three feelings. 4. (1) Whether felt internally or externally as pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—(2) knowing this as suffering, with wisdom one contacts destructible, impermanent phenomena. Seeing their vanishing, one becomes dispassionate here."  

[3] Third: Abandonment 3. "Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. What three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Bhikkhus, these are the three feelings. 4. Through pleasant feeling, the latent tendency to lust is abandoned. Through painful feeling, the latent tendency to aversion is abandoned. Through neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, the latent tendency to ignorance is abandoned. 5. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has abandoned the latent tendency to lust by pleasant feeling, who has abandoned aversion by painful feeling, and who has abandoned ignorance by neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling—such a bhikkhu, endowed with right view, has cut off craving, destroyed the fetters, eradicated conceit, and made an end of suffering. 6. (1) One who feels pleasure without understanding feelings and sees no escape remains with the latent tendency to lust. (2) One who feels pain without understanding feelings and sees no escape remains with the latent tendency to aversion. (3) Though the Buddha of vast wisdom teaches the neither-painful-nor-pleasant, delighting in it, one does not abandon suffering. (4) But a bhikkhu who is diligent, not neglecting clear comprehension—this wise one fully understands all feelings. (5) Having fully understood them, he is free of taints in this very life. Remaining with the highest knowledge, having reached the far shore of the Dhamma, with the dissolution of the body, he does not enter the realm of rebirth."  

[4] Fourth: The Precipice 3. "Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling speaks of ‘a precipice of the ocean.’ That claim is baseless. 4. Bhikkhus, ‘precipice’ here refers to bodily painful feeling. 5. When an uninstructed worldling is contacted by bodily painful feeling, he sorrows, grieves, laments, beats his breast, and becomes confused. This is called an uninstructed worldling who has not stood on the precipice or gained a foothold. 6. When an instructed noble disciple is contacted by bodily painful feeling, he does not sorrow, grieve, lament, beat his breast, or become confused. This is called an instructed noble disciple who has stood on the precipice and gained a foothold. (1) Bodily pain arises that threatens life. Being struck by it, one trembles, weeps, loses strength, and cannot endure it. This is called not standing on the precipice. (2) Bodily pain arises that threatens life. Being struck by it, one does not tremble and can endure it. This is called standing on the precipice."  

[5] Fifth: What Should Be Seen 3. "Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. What three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Bhikkhus, pleasant feeling should be seen as suffering. Painful feeling should be seen as an arrow. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling should be seen as impermanent. 4. A bhikkhu who sees pleasant feeling as suffering, painful feeling as an arrow, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling as impermanent is called one who has cut off craving, destroyed the fetters, eradicated conceit, and made an end of suffering. Seeing pleasure as suffering, pain as an arrow, and neutrality as impermanent, this rightly viewing bhikkhu, having fully understood feelings, dwells having reached the far shore of the Dhamma. Knowing the end of suffering, taintless in this life, with the dissolution of the body, he does not enter the realm of rebirth."  

[6] Sixth: The Arrow 3. "Bhikkhus, an uninstructed worldling experiences pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings. 4. An instructed noble disciple also experiences these three feelings. 5. What is the distinction between them?" 6. "Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One..." 7. "When an uninstructed worldling is struck by painful feeling, he sorrows, grieves, and becomes confused. He feels two feelings: bodily and mental. 8. Like a man struck by one arrow, then another: he feels two arrows. Similarly, an uninstructed worldling, struck by painful feeling, sorrows and grieves. He feels two feelings. When contacted by pain, he resents it. Resentment toward pain plants the latent tendency to aversion. He seeks pleasure elsewhere, not knowing escape from pain. Delighting in pleasure, he plants the latent tendency to lust. Not understanding the origin, passing, allure, danger, or escape from feelings, he plants the latent tendency to ignorance. Bound by pleasure, pain, and neutrality, he is fettered by birth, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair. 9. An instructed noble disciple, struck by painful feeling, does not sorrow or grieve. He feels one feeling: bodily, not mental. 10. Like a man struck by one arrow, not a second. He feels one pain. Similarly, a noble disciple struck by pain endures it without resentment. He does not seek pleasure, plants no latent tendency. Understanding the origin, passing, allure, and danger of feelings, he does not plant ignorance. Free from bondage to pleasure, pain, or neutrality, he is not fettered by birth, death, sorrow, or despair. 11. This is the distinction. 12. (1) The wise, learned, do not tremble at pleasure or pain. (2) Knowing phenomena, seeing this world and beyond, the noble disciple’s mind is undisturbed. Without delight, he does not dwell in aversion. (3) His tendencies vanish, destroyed. Crossing over existence, stainless, he knows the state beyond birth, realizing Nibbāna."  

[7] Seventh: Sickness (1) 1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the Great Wood’s Hall with the Peaked Roof. 2. In the evening, the Blessed One rose from seclusion and went to the infirmary. Sitting down, he addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, dwell mindful and clearly comprehending. This is my instruction. 3. How is one mindful? A bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, removing covetousness and displeasure toward the world. Similarly with feelings, mind, and phenomena. 4. How is one clearly comprehending? Acting with clear comprehension when moving forward, backward, looking ahead or around, bending limbs, bearing robes, eating, drinking, urinating, defecating, walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, or silent. 5. Thus dwell mindful and clearly comprehending. 6. A bhikkhu established thus, when pleasant feeling arises, knows: ‘This arises dependent on contact—a conditioned, impermanent thing.’ Contemplating its fading, he abandons the latent tendency to lust. 7. When painful feeling arises... he abandons aversion. 8. When neutral feeling arises... he abandons ignorance. 9. Experiencing a feeling, he knows it as impermanent, not clinging. 10. Free from bondage to any feeling. 11. Knowing ‘I feel this feeling bounded by the body and life.’ At the body’s breakup, he understands: ‘Here all that is felt becomes cool.’ 12. Just as a lamp burns dependent on oil and wick. When these perish, it goes out. So too, after the body’s breakup, all feelings cool."  

[8] Eighth: Sickness (2) 1–2. As above. 3. How is one mindful? Contemplating body, feelings, mind, phenomena... 4. How clearly comprehending? As before. 5. Dwell thus. 6. When pleasant feeling arises via contact, he knows: ‘This is conditioned, impermanent.’ Contemplating cessation, he abandons lust. 7–8. Similarly with painful and neutral feelings, abandoning aversion and ignorance. 9–12. As above, with simile of the lamp."  

[9] Ninth: Impermanence 3. "Bhikkhus, these three feelings are impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, fading, cessation, and relinquishment. 4. What three? Pleasant, painful, and neutral. 5. These are impermanent... to be relinquished."  

[10] Tenth: Rooted in Contact 3. "Bhikkhus, these three feelings arise from contact, depend on contact, originate from contact. 4. What three? Pleasant, painful, neutral. 5–7. Pleasant feeling arises from pleasant contact. When contact ceases, that feeling ceases. So for painful and neutral. 8. Like heat and flame from two sticks rubbed. When separated, the heat fades. 9. Just so, feelings cease with their contact’s cessation."
