3. The All  

23. The All  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi... There...  

2. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the all. Listen closely...  

3. Bhikkhus, what is the all? The eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odors, the tongue and tastes, the body and tangibles, the mind and mental phenomena. This, bhikkhus, is called the all.  

4. Bhikkhus, if anyone says, ‘Rejecting this all, I shall proclaim another all,’ that would be mere empty talk. When questioned, he would be unable to answer and would further incur vexation. Why? Because, bhikkhus, that would not be within the realm of possibility.”  

24. Abandoning (1)  

2. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma for abandoning all. Listen closely...  

3. Bhikkhus, what is the Dhamma for abandoning all?  

4-8. Bhikkhus, the eye should be abandoned, forms should be abandoned, eye-consciousness should be abandoned, eye-contact should be abandoned. Whatever feeling—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—arises dependent on eye-contact, that too should be abandoned... The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body...  

9. The mind should be abandoned, mental phenomena should be abandoned, mind-consciousness should be abandoned, mind-contact should be abandoned. Whatever feeling—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—arises dependent on mind-contact, that too should be abandoned.  

10. Bhikkhus, this is the Dhamma for abandoning all.”  

25. Abandoning (2)  

2. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma to be abandoned through full understanding and comprehension. Listen closely...  

3. Bhikkhus, what is to be abandoned through full understanding and comprehension?  

4-8. The eye is to be abandoned through full understanding and comprehension. Eye-consciousness... eye-contact... whatever feeling arising from eye-contact... is to be abandoned through full understanding and comprehension... The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body...  

9. The mind is to be abandoned through full understanding and comprehension. Mind-consciousness... mind-contact... whatever feeling arising from mind-contact... is to be abandoned through full understanding and comprehension.  

10. Bhikkhus, this is the Dhamma to be abandoned through full understanding and comprehension.”  

26. Fully Understanding (1)  

2. “Bhikkhus, without fully understanding, without comprehending, without detaching from, and without abandoning the all, one cannot end suffering.  

3. Bhikkhus, if anyone does not fully understand, comprehend, detach from, and abandon the entire all, they cannot end suffering.  

4-8. If one does not fully understand the eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact... or whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact... and does not comprehend, detach from, or abandon these, they cannot end suffering... The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body...  

9. If one does not fully understand the mind, mental phenomena, mind-consciousness... or whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact... they cannot end suffering.  

10. Bhikkhus, one who does not abandon the all in this way cannot end suffering.  

11. Bhikkhus, one who fully understands, comprehends, detaches from, and abandons the all can end suffering.  

12-18. ...  

19. Bhikkhus, this is how one who fully understands, comprehends, detaches from, and abandons the all ends suffering.”  

27. Fully Understanding (2)  

2. “Bhikkhus, without fully understanding... cannot end suffering.  

3. How so?  

4-8. The eye, forms, eye-consciousness... the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body...  

9. The mind, mental phenomena, mind-consciousness...  

10. Without abandoning these, suffering cannot end.  

11-17. By fully understanding and abandoning these...  

18. Bhikkhus, this is how one ends suffering.”  

28. Burning  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Gayasisa with a thousand bhikkhus...  

2. “Bhikkhus, all is burning. What is burning?  

3-8. The eye is burning, forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... feeling... burning with the fires of lust, hatred, delusion; burning with birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair... The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body... The mind...  

9. Seeing thus, a noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, forms... feeling... Through disenchantment comes dispassion; through dispassion, liberation. ‘Birth is ended...’  

10. ...The bhikkhus rejoiced at the Blessed One’s words.  

11. ...Their minds were liberated from the taints.”  

29. Darkness  

1. At Rajagaha...  

2. “Bhikkhus, all is darkness. What is darkness?  

3-8. The eye... forms... eye-contact... feeling... darkens through birth, aging, death, sorrow... The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body... The mind...  

9. Seeing thus... one is liberated.”  

30. Appropriate  

2. “Bhikkhus, I will teach the path to the abandoning of all conceptual proliferation.  

3-9. A bhikkhu does not conceive the eye... forms... feeling... ear... tongue... mind... ‘I am this.’  

10. Not conceiving anything, unattached, unclinging, one attains Nibbāna...  

11-12. This is the path.”  

31. Directly Visible (1)  

2. “Bhikkhus, the path abandoning conceptual proliferation...  

3-9. Not conceiving eye... ear... mind... existence...  

10. Unattached, liberated.”  

32. Directly Visible (2)  

2. ...  

3-9. “Bhikkhus, is the eye permanent or impermanent?... feeling...?  

10. Seeing thus... liberation arises. Birth is ended...  

11. This is the path.”
