1. [1] 1. The First (Based on Detachment)  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are five forces. What are the five forces? The force of faith, the force of energy, the force of mindfulness, the force of concentration, and the force of wisdom. Bhikkhus, these are the five forces.  

3. Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges River flows toward the east, slopes toward the east, and merges into the east, so too, one who cultivates and frequently develops the five forces flows toward Nirvana, slopes toward Nirvana, and merges into Nirvana. Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently develops the five forces flow toward Nirvana, slope toward Nirvana, and merge into Nirvana?  

4. Bhikkhus, here, a bhikkhu cultivates the force of faith, which leads to relinquishment through detachment, dispassion, and cessation... cultivates the force of energy... the force of mindfulness... the force of concentration... the force of wisdom.  

5. Bhikkhus, in this way, a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently develops the five forces flows toward Nirvana, slopes toward Nirvana, and merges into Nirvana."  

[2–12] 2–12. Second–Twelfth  

The verses of this chapter state:  

Six on flowing east,  
Six on flowing to the sea,  
Two sixes and twelve:  
Thus, the Ganges Chapter is taught.  

The expanded explanation based on the forces may be further expanded.
