6. The Great Discourse on the Ganges [51-62] 1-12 2. "Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges River flows toward the east, [heads toward the east, merges into the east], so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who cultivates the four foundations of mindfulness, [who cultivates them extensively,] flows toward Nibbāna, heads toward Nibbāna, [and] merges into Nibbāna. 3. Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu cultivate the four foundations of mindfulness, develop them extensively, and thereby flow toward Nibbāna, head toward Nibbāna, and merge into Nibbāna? 4. Bhikkhus, here a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, mindful, having subdued worldly greed and distress; contemplating feeling in feelings... mind in mind... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, fully aware, mindful, having subdued worldly greed and distress. Bhikkhus, it is in this way that a bhikkhu cultivates the four foundations of mindfulness, develops them extensively, and thereby flows toward Nibbāna, heads toward Nibbāna, and merges into Nibbāna." Verses of the Chapter: Six on flowing east, six on flowing to the sea; twice six make twelve. Thus this chapter is declared. If one were to expound the Ganges extensively, it should be expounded through the foundations of mindfulness.
