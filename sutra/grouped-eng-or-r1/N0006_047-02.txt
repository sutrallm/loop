2. Narakanda Vagga

2.1. The Great Man  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. Then the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Venerable Sariputta said to the Blessed One:  
3. "Venerable sir, it is said, 'a great man, a great man.' In what way, venerable sir, is one called a great man?"  
"The mind is liberated, Sariputta. Therefore, I call one a great man. If the mind is not liberated, one is not called a great man."  
"Sariputta, how is one's mind liberated?"  
4. "Here, Sariputta, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating the body in the body, his mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by non-clinging. Similarly, regarding feelings... mind... phenomena, he dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, his mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by non-clinging.  
5. "Thus, Sariputta, the mind is liberated. Therefore, I call one a great man. If the mind is not liberated, one is not called a great man."

2.2. Narakanda  
1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Narakanda in the Ambavana grove of the cloth merchants.  
2. Then the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One... (The dialogue proceeds similarly as in 2.1, with Sariputta expressing his unwavering confidence in the Buddha's unsurpassed knowledge and wisdom, leading to an extended discussion on how Sariputta, despite not having direct knowledge of past or future Buddhas, infers the Buddha's preeminence through understanding the Dharma's consistency. The Buddha approves his reasoning, comparing it to a guarded city gate ensuring only the worthy enter, thereby affirming Sariputta's insight into the Dharma's universal principles.)

2.3. Cunda  
1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.  
2. At that time, the Venerable Sariputta was dwelling in the Magadha country at the village of Nalaka, afflicted by a severe illness. The novice Cunda was his attendant.  
3-6. (Describes Sariputta's parinibbana, Cunda informing Ananda, and their communication to the Buddha, expressing grief. The Buddha consoles Ananda by emphasizing that Sariputta's liberation was through the Dharma, not mere physical form, and advises reliance on oneself and the Dharma through the four foundations of mindfulness, concluding with the metaphor of a great tree losing branches but standing firm.)

2.4. Channa  
1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjis at Ukkacela on the bank of the Ganges River, together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, not long after Sariputta and Moggallana had attained parinibbana.  
2-9. (The Buddha addresses the Sangha, acknowledging the void left by the two chief disciples but affirming the impermanence of all conditioned things, urging reliance on self and Dharma through the four foundations of mindfulness. The discourse parallels 2.3, reinforced with the analogy of a great tree losing major branches.)

2.5. Bahiya  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. Then the Venerable Bahiya approached the Blessed One... (Bahiya requests brief instruction, receives guidance on purifying virtue and right view as foundational, and the cultivation of the four foundations of mindfulness. He attains arahantship through diligent practice.)

2.6. Udayi  
1. Similarly, the Venerable Udayi approaches the Buddha, receives identical instruction as Bahiya (2.5), and achieves liberation.)

2.7. The Noble Path  
1-4. (The Buddha declares that the four foundations of mindfulness constitute the noble path leading to liberation from suffering, transcending sorrow, and realizing Nibbana.)

2.8. Brahma Sahampati  
1. At the time of the Buddha's enlightenment at Uruvela by the Nera√±jara River under the Ajapala banyan tree, Brahma Sahampati affirms the Buddha's discovery of the four foundations of mindfulness as the singular path to liberation, reappearing to encourage the Buddha to teach.)

2.9. The Acrobat  
1-8. (A parable of an acrobat and his apprentice illustrates mutual and individual responsibility in practice. Emphasizing self-protection through mindfulness and protecting others through patience and compassion, the Buddha connects this to the cultivation of the four foundations.)

2.10. The Country  
1-5. (The Buddha uses the analogy of a man balancing a pot of oil while walking between a captivating dancer and a swordsman to stress the urgency and single-minded focus required in cultivating mindfulness of the body. The pot symbolizes mindfulness, requiring undivided attention to avoid spiritual death.)

Conclusion of the Narakanda Vagga: The ten suttas in this chapter cover themes of liberation through mindfulness, the impermanence of even great disciples, reliance on self and Dharma, and the disciplined focus necessary for attaining freedom.
