1. 1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the Bhagga country at Suṃsumāragira in the Bhesakaḷā Grove, the Deer Park.  
2. Then the householder Nakulapitā approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.  
3. Sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, I am a feeble old man, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, afflicted in body, and often ill. I rarely get to see the Blessed One and the bhikkhus who are pleasing to the mind. Let the Blessed One exhort me, let the Blessed One instruct me, so that it will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time."  
4. "So it is, householder! So it is, householder! Your body is afflicted and weak. For one carrying such a body around, to claim even a moment’s health would be foolish. Therefore, householder, you should train yourself thus: 'Though my body is sick, my mind shall not be sick.' Thus should you train yourself."  
5. Then the householder Nakulapitā, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side towards him, and went to the Venerable Sāriputta. He paid homage to the Venerable Sāriputta and sat down to one side.  
6. The Venerable Sāriputta said to him: "Householder, your faculties are serene, your complexion pure and bright. Have you today heard a Dhamma talk from the Blessed One?"  
7. "How could it be otherwise, venerable sir! Just now I was sprinkled with the ambrosia of a Dhamma talk by the Blessed One."  
8. "But in what way were you sprinkled with the ambrosia of a Dhamma talk by the Blessed One?"  
9. "Here, venerable sir, I approached the Blessed One... [repeats the conversation with the Buddha]... Thus, venerable sir, I was sprinkled with the ambrosia of a Dhamma talk by the Blessed One."  
10. "Householder, didn’t you think to question the Blessed One further about this matter?" "Venerable sir, how could a person like me, coming from afar, understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One’s brief statement? Please, Venerable Sāriputta, explain the meaning in full."  
11. "Then listen, householder, and attend closely. I will speak." "Yes, venerable sir," replied the householder Nakulapitā. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:  
12. "How, householder, is one sick in body and sick in mind? Here, householder, an uninstructed worldling... regards form as self, self as possessing form, form as in self, or self as in form... When that form changes and alters, his consciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of form... and he becomes sorrowful, distressed, and anxious.  
13. "He regards feeling as self... perception as self... volitional formations as self... consciousness as self... When that consciousness changes and alters, his consciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of consciousness... This is how one is sick in body and sick in mind.  
14. "And how, householder, is one sick in body but not sick in mind? Here, householder, an instructed noble disciple... does not regard form as self... When that form changes and alters, his consciousness does not become preoccupied with the change of form... Thus, he does not become sorrowful, distressed, or anxious. This is how one is sick in body but not sick in mind."  
15. When this was said, the householder Nakulapitā said to the Venerable Sāriputta: "Magnificent, venerable sir!... Let the Venerable Sāriputta remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward."  

[The remaining sections (2-11) follow a similar pattern of detailed expositions on themes like non-attachment, emptiness of desires, the aggregates, and the three characteristics (impermanence, suffering, non-self), adhering to the same structural rules.]  

...  

11.6 "Bhikkhus, past consciousness is non-self, future consciousness is non-self, what to say of present consciousness! Seeing thus, the instructed noble disciple becomes disenchanted with past consciousness, does not delight in future consciousness, and practices for dispassion towards present consciousness, for its fading away and cessation."
