2. The Chapter on Anāthapiṇḍika  

[11] 1. Candimasa  
1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī... Then, the deva Candimasa, at dawn, illuminating the entire Jetavana with his surpassing radiance, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage and stood to one side.  

2. Standing to one side, the deva Candimasa recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One: "With skillful mind concentrated, mindful in meditation, Like forest creatures in a grove without mosquitoes, They walk safely, not given to heedlessness. Those who abandon quarrels and afflictions enter meditation, Like fish breaking through a net, they are able to walk safely."  

[12] 2. Viṇṇu  
1. Standing to one side, the deva Viṇṇu recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One: "Serving the Well-Gone One, following the teaching of Gotama—Truly fortunate is the one who learns heedlessness!"  

2. [The Blessed One replied: "Viṇṇu!"] "From my teachings they learn verses, enter meditation, Ever heedful—they do not fall into Death’s realm."  

[13] 3. Tigālametti  
1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove near Rājagaha.  

2. Then the deva Tigālametti approached the Blessed One at dawn, illuminating the entire Bamboo Grove with his surpassing radiance. Having approached, he paid homage and stood to one side.  

3. Standing to one side, the deva Tigālametti recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One: "A monk in meditation, with mind liberated, Knowing the world’s rise and fall, his mind unattached—Though seeking to attain, he does not grasp results."  

[14] 4. Nandana  
1. Standing to one side, the deva Nandana addressed the Blessed One with this verse: "Greatly Wise Gotama, uncovered in all things, O Great Hero with knowledge and vision, I ask you: What virtuous one, what wise one, What one beyond suffering do the devas revere?"  

2. [The Blessed One:] "One endowed with virtue and wisdom, Cultivating a diligent mind, Calm, delighting in meditation, mindful, abandoning sorrows— One who has exhausted all defilements, bearing his final body— Such a practitioner is called virtuous. Such a practitioner is called wise. Such a one beyond suffering is revered by devas."  

[15] 5. Candana  
1. Standing to one side, the deva Candana recited this verse: "Day and night untiring, Without grounds or clinging— How does one cross the torrent? Who does not sink deeply?"  

2. [The Blessed One:] "Ever perfect in virtue, wise, serene-minded, Striving unshaken—they cross the torrent’s peril. Detached from sensual desires, beyond bonds of form, Having ended delight and greed—they do not sink."  

[16] 6. Sudatta  
1. Standing to one side, the deva Sudatta recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence: "Like touching a blade, like hair aflame— A monk abandoning sensual desire, mindfully goes forth."  

2. [The Blessed One:] "Like touching a blade, like hair aflame— A monk abandoning self-view, mindfully goes forth."  

[17] 7. Subrahmā  
1. Standing to one side, the deva Subrahmā addressed the Blessed One with this verse: "This mind is ever fearful, this thought ever trembling. Even when arising or ceasing, it feels terror. If there is a path beyond fear, teach it to me."  

2. [The Blessed One:] "Apart from the awakening factors, Beyond cultivation and restraint of senses, Apart from relinquishing all—I see no safety for beings."  

[18] 8. Kondañña  
1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa in the Añjana Grove, the deer park.  

2. The deva Kondañña approached the Blessed One at dawn, illuminating the Añjana Grove. Having paid homage, he stood to one side and asked, "Monk, are you joyful?" [The Blessed One:] "Friend, what have you gained?" The deva: "Monk, then are you sorrowful?" [The Blessed One:] "Friend, what have you lost?" [Deva:] "Monk, do you neither rejoice nor grieve?" [The Blessed One:] "Indeed, friend."  

3. [Deva:] "Monk, you neither grieve nor rejoice. Sitting alone, detached, you dwell without longing."  

4. [The Blessed One:] "Yaksha, I neither grieve nor rejoice. Sitting alone, serene, I dwell free from clinging."  

5. [Deva:] "How, monk, no grief, no joy? Sitting alone, detached, no longing?"  

6. [The Blessed One:] "For those with grief, there is joy; For those with joy, there is grief. The monk is free from both—Know this, friend."  

7. [Deva:] "Free from joy and grief, Transcending worldly attachment— Such a monk, immersed in Nirvana— Truly, long have I seen this Brahmin!"  

[19] 9. Uttara  
1. [At Rājagaha.] Standing to one side, the deva Uttara recited this verse: "Life leads to death, youth ends in decay. Seeing this fear in death, accumulate merit for joy."  

2. [The Blessed One:] "Life leads to death, youth ends in decay. Seeing this fear in death, forsake desires, seek peace."  

[20] 10. Anāthapiṇḍika  
1. Standing to one side, the deva Anāthapiṇḍika recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence: "This is that Jetavana, abode of the noble Sangha. Dwell here, Dharma King—may my devotion bring joy. By wholesome mind, wisdom, Dhamma’s path, and pure livelihood, One is purified. Not by clan or wealth, but by the wise reflecting on their welfare and choosing Dhamma: Thus they are purified through virtue and wisdom, Reaching stillness, like Sāriputta—a monk beyond the flood, supreme."  

2. Having spoken, the deva Anāthapiṇḍika paid homage, circumambulated the Blessed One, and vanished.  

3. Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the monks:  

4. "Monks, last night a deva illuminated Jetavana and approached me at dawn. He paid homage, stood to one side, and recited: 'This is that Jetavana... ...supreme.'"  

5. "Having spoken, he vanished."  

6. Venerable Ānanda said: "Perhaps that deva was Anāthapiṇḍika. The layman Anāthapiṇḍika had deep faith in Venerable Sāriputta."  

7. "Good, Ānanda! You have discerned it. Indeed, that was Anāthapiṇḍika."
