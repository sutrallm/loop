10. Bhikkhu Saṃyutta

1. First Kulitāra

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.

2. Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna.

3. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: "Friends, when I had gone to a secluded place and sat down, this thought arose in my mind: 'Noble silence, noble silence — what is called noble silence?'"

4. "Friends, I considered: 'Here a bhikkhu, with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought, enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal clarity and unification of mind, is without applied and sustained thought, and is filled with rapture and happiness born of concentration. This is called noble silence.'"

5. "Friends, then, with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought, entering and dwelling in the second jhāna... I abided. Friends, while abiding thus, there arose in me perceptions and thoughts connected with applied thought."

6. "Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by his power and said: 'Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Brahmin, do not be heedless regarding noble silence. Establish your mind in noble silence, unify your mind in noble silence, concentrate your mind on noble silence.'"

7. "Then, friends, later... I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna... If one would rightly say: 'The disciple was guarded by the Teacher and attained great supernormal power,' it is I of whom this should be said."

2. Second Upatissa

1. At Sāvatthī...

2. Then the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"

"Friend," those bhikkhus replied.

3. The Venerable Sāriputta said: "Friends, when I retired to solitude and sat down, this thought arose: 'What in the world is such that, through its change and alteration, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise in me?'"

4. "The Venerable Ānanda said to Sāriputta: 'Friend Sāriputta, even if there is change and alteration in the Teacher, would there be no sorrow?'"

5. "Friend Ānanda, even with the Teacher's change and alteration, there would be no sorrow. But he was a greatly powerful Teacher. Even if he were to live long, it would be for the benefit of many."

6. "Truly for a long time, the Venerable Sāriputta has well removed my conceit."

7. "But the Venerable Sāriputta has abandoned sorrow through the Teacher's change."

3. Third Jar

1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was at Sāvatthī...

2. Then the Venerable Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna were dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground.

3. In the evening, Sāriputta approached Mahāmoggallāna. They exchanged greetings and sat down.

4. Sāriputta said: "Friend, your faculties are serene. Today you must dwell in a peaceful abode."

5. "Friend, today I dwelled in a coarse state, but had Dhamma discussion."

6. "With whom did you discuss Dhamma?"

"With the Blessed One."

7. "But the Blessed One is far away. Did you approach him by superpower or did he come here?"

8. "Neither. Both the Blessed One and I have purified divine eye and ear elements."

9. "What Dhamma was discussed?"

10. "I asked: 'Venerable sir, what is diligent exertion?' The Blessed One replied: 'A bhikkhu exerts until skin, sinews, and bones remain, his flesh and blood dry up. If not attained, he will not relax. Such is diligent exertion.'"

11. "Like a small stone beside Mount Sineru, we are subordinate to Mahāmoggallāna. Like a salt crystal in a salt jar, we follow Sāriputta."

12. Sāriputta, praised by the Buddha for wisdom and virtue, is foremost among those who have crossed over.

4. Fourth The Youth

1. At Sāvatthī...

2. A young bhikkhu, after eating, retired alone, inactive and silent, not helping others sew robes.

3. The bhikkhus reported this to the Buddha, who summoned him.

4. The Buddha asked: "Do you act thus?" The bhikkhu replied: "Venerable sir, I do my own duties."

5. Knowing his mind, the Buddha said: "Do not trouble him. He has attained the four jhānas and abides in the ultimate goal."

6. Though young, he has conquered Māra’s army and dwells in his last body.

5. Fifth Subhūti

1. At Sāvatthī...

2. The Venerable Subhūti approached. The Buddha declared: "This clansman is beautiful in body and mind. Having left home, he realizes the highest goal."

6. Sixth Vakkali

1. At Sāvatthī...

2. The dwarf bhikkhu Vakkali approached. The Buddha said: "Though ugly and scorned, he has great power and has achieved what is hard to attain."

7. Seventh Visākha

1. At Vesālī...

2. The Venerable Visākha taught the bhikkhus with sweet, meaningful Dhamma talks.

3. The Buddha praised him, saying: "He speaks aptly, establishing the Dhamma standard."

8. Eighth Nanda

1. At Sāvatthī...

2. Nanda, well-dressed and adorned, approached. The Buddha admonished him to live austerely.

3. Later, Nanda lived in the forest, seeking alms, wearing rags, free from desire.

9. Ninth Tissa

1. At Sāvatthī...

2. Tissa, weeping, came to the Buddha. When mocked by bhikkhus, he was unable to bear it.

3. The Buddha advised: "If you cannot endure ridicule, the homeless life is unfit for you."

10. Tenth Thera

1. At Rājagaha...

2. A bhikkhu named Thera, praising solitude, dwelled alone.

3. The Buddha explained true solitude: abandoning past, not longing for future, and releasing present cravings.

11. Eleventh Mahākoṭṭhita

1. At Sāvatthī...

2. The fair-skinned, high-nosed Mahākoṭṭhita approached.

3. The Buddha declared him a great meditator, having achieved the highest goal.

12. Twelfth Companions

1. At Sāvatthī...

2. Two companions of Mahākoṭṭhita approached. The Buddha praised them as accomplished meditators.
