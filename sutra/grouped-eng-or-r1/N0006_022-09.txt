4. THE ELDERS

(83) 1. ĀNANDA  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Śrāvastī, Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  

2. There, the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"  
"Friend," those bhikkhus replied to the Venerable Ānanda.  
The Venerable Ānanda said:  

3. "When we were newly ordained, the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta greatly benefited us. He instructed us with this teaching:  

‘Friend Ānanda, through clinging there is "I am," through not clinging there is no "I am."  

4. Through clinging to what is there "I am"? Through not clinging what is there no "I am"?  

Through clinging to form there is "I am"; through not clinging there is no "I am." Through clinging to feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness there is "I am"; through not clinging there is no "I am."  

5. Friend Ānanda, just as a young man or woman, fond of ornaments, examining their own facial reflection in a clean, polished mirror or a bowl of clear water, sees it through clinging, not seeing it without clinging. So too, friend Ānanda: through clinging to form there is "I am," through not clinging there is no "I am." Through clinging to feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness there is "I am," through not clinging there is no "I am."  

6. Friend Ānanda, what do you think? Is form permanent or impermanent?’  
‘Friend, it is impermanent.’  

7–10. ‘Is feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness permanent or impermanent?’  
‘Friend, it is impermanent.’  

11. Therefore, in this regard...  

12. Seeing thus... one understands... no more future existence.’  

13. When we were newly ordained, the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta greatly benefited us. He instructed us with this teaching. Having heard this Dhamma explanation from him, I directly realized the Dhamma."  

(84) 2. TISSA  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Sāvatthī...  

2. Then the Venerable Tissa, the Blessed One’s cousin, told many bhikkhus: "Friends, my body feels slack. I’m disoriented, cannot distinguish the Dhamma. My mind is clouded by sloth, I find no joy in the holy life, and I doubt the Dhamma."  

3–4. The bhikkhus reported this to the Blessed One, who summoned Tissa.  

5–8. When questioned, Tissa confirmed his statement.  

9. The Blessed One asked: "Tissa, if one has not abandoned lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever, and craving for form, would change and alteration in that form lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair?"  
"Yes, Bhante."  

10–14. Similarly regarding feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

15–18. "But if one has abandoned lust for form... would change in form cause such suffering?"  
"No, Bhante."  

19. "Therefore, Tissa, regarding form as impermanent...  

24–25. Seeing thus... one understands... no more future existence.  

26–31. The Blessed One gave an analogy of two men—one lost, one knowing the path—explaining right view, the jungle of ignorance, etc., concluding: "Rejoice, Tissa, in my instruction!"  

32. When this was spoken, Venerable Tissa rejoiced.  

(85) 3. YAMAKA  

1. At Sāvatthī, Venerable Sāriputta heard that Yamaka held the wrong view: "When an arahant dies, they are annihilated."  

2–9. Other bhikkhus failed to dissuade him.  

10–12. Sāriputta questioned Yamaka, leading him through impermanence and not-self analysis.  

14–33. Through cross-examination, Yamaka admitted no self in the aggregates, abandoning his wrong view.  

34–58. Sāriputta gave an analogy of an assassin pretending to serve, illustrating how untaught persons mistake aggregates for self. Yamaka gained liberation, later explaining that with the cessation of aggregates, "the arahant is deep, immeasurable, unfathomable like the ocean."  

(86) 4. ANURADdHA  

1. At Vesālī, Venerable Anurādha was asked by wanderers whether the Tathāgata exists after death, etc.  

2–8. He rejected all four positions, but they dismissed him as inexperienced.  

9–21. The Buddha confirmed his correct response via interrogating him on the aggregates, concluding that the Tathāgata cannot be identified with any of them or apart from them.  

22. "Thus Anurādha, I teach suffering and its cessation."  

(87) 5. BĀKULA  

1. At Rājagaha, the terminally ill Venerable Bākula had the Buddha visit.  

2–9. Rejecting sorrow, Bākula confirmed his purity.  

10–16. The Buddha: "Seeing Dhamma is seeing me. Form... consciousness is impermanent."  

17. After teaching, the Buddha left.  

18–27. Bākula asked to be carried to a mountain pass, where he passed away. Two deities confirmed his liberation.  

28–40. Bākula’s final message declared freedom from clinging to the aggregates. When he died, Māra sought his consciousness in vain.  

(88) 6. ASSAJI  

1. At Rājagaha, the ill Venerable Assaji reaffirmed no clinging to aggregates.  

2–21. The Buddha questioned him about feelings, giving an oil lamp simile: when fuel ends, the flame "cannot be designated".  

22–27. Assaji realized liberation through understanding the cessation of feelings.  

(89) 7. CHANNA  

1. At Kosambī, elders questioned the terminally ill Venerable Channa’s assertion: "Though I say ‘I am’ regarding aggregates, I don’t regard them thus."  

2–27. Through flower and cloth-washing analogies, he explained residual subtle conceit even after stream-entry. Through contemplating rise/fall of aggregates, final defilements are abandoned.  

28–31. Upon hearing this, 60 bhikkhus were liberated.  

(90) 8. CHANNA  

1. At Bārāṇasī, Venerable Channa approached elders seeking Dhamma instruction but remained unsatisfied.  

2–18. Finding Ānanda, he heard the doctrine of dependent arising and middle way avoiding existence/non-existence extremes.  

19. Channa gained liberation.  

(91) 9. RĀHULA (1)  

1–3. Rāhula asked how to abandon conceit regarding body and externals.  

4–9. The Buddha taught contemplating all forms/feelings/etc. as "not mine, not I, not my self."  

(92) 10. RĀHULA (2)  

1–3. A similar dialogue, concluding with transcending all signs through non-clinging.
