1. [1] First: The Dreadful  
1. Thus have I heard. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.  
2. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus... The Blessed One said:  
3. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful, fierce, and brutal, an obstacle to reaching the ultimate safety.  
4. Bhikkhus! Therefore, train yourselves thus: ‘We will abandon arisen gains, honors, and renown, and we will not let our minds be bound by unarisen gains, honors, and renown.’  
5. Bhikkhus! You should train yourselves thus."  

[2] Second: The Hook  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful, fierce, and brutal, an obstacle to reaching the ultimate safety.  
3. Bhikkhus! Suppose a fisherman baits a hook with meat and casts it into a deep pool. A water-beast sees it and swallows it. Bhikkhus! That water-beast, having swallowed the fisherman’s baited hook, meets calamity and disaster, and the fisherman gets what he wants.  
4. Bhikkhus! The fisherman is Mara the Evil One. The hook is gains, honors, and renown.  
5. Bhikkhus! Any bhikkhu who does not abandon arisen gains, honors, and renown but desires them has swallowed Mara’s hook, meets calamity and disaster, and fulfills Mara’s desire.  
6. Bhikkhus! Thus, gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
7. Bhikkhus! Therefore, train yourselves thus: ‘We will abandon arisen gains, honors, and renown, and we will not let our minds be bound by unarisen ones.’  
8. Bhikkhus! You should train yourselves thus."  

[3] Third: The Turtle  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful... obstacles.  
3. Bhikkhus! Once, in a lake, there lived a turtle with its large family.  
4. Bhikkhus! Then one turtle said to another: ‘Dear turtle, do not go there.’  
5. Bhikkhus! But that turtle still went there and was pierced by a hunter’s harpoon attached to a rope.  
6. Bhikkhus! Then that turtle approached another turtle.  
7. Bhikkhus! Seeing it approach from afar, the other turtle said: ‘Dear turtle, why did you go there?’ ‘Dear turtle, I went there.’  
8. ‘Dear turtle, weren’t you pierced or struck?’ ‘Dear turtle, I was not pierced or struck, but there is a rope tied to my back.’  
9. ‘Dear turtle, you are indeed pierced! Your father and grandfathers met calamity and disaster because of hunters. Go now—you no longer belong to us!’  
10. Bhikkhus! The hunter is Mara. The harpoon with the rope is gains, honors, and renown. The rope is lust and craving.  
11. Bhikkhus! Any bhikkhu who does not abandon arisen gains, honors, and renown but desires them is pierced by Mara’s harpoon, meets calamity and disaster, and fulfills Mara’s desire.  
12. Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
13. Bhikkhus! You should train yourselves thus."  

[4] Fourth: The Long-Haired Ram  
1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful... obstacles.  
3. Bhikkhus! Suppose a long-haired ram enters a thorny thicket. It gets entangled here and there, bound here and there, meeting calamity and disaster everywhere.  
4. Bhikkhus! Similarly, a bhikkhu overcome by gains, honors, and renown, with mind deluded, robes himself in the morning, takes his bowl, and enters a village or town. He becomes entangled here and there, bound here and there, meeting calamity and disaster everywhere.  
5. Bhikkhus! Such gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
6. Bhikkhus! You should train yourselves thus."  

[5] Fifth: The Maggot  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful... obstacles.  
3. Bhikkhus! Suppose a maggot feeds on dung, is glutted with dung, buried in dung, and sees a dung heap ahead. It thinks: ‘I feed on dung, am glutted with dung, buried in dung, and have this great dung heap before me!’ It looks down on other maggots.  
4. Bhikkhus! Similarly, a bhikkhu overcome by gains, honors, and renown, with mind deluded, robes himself in the morning, takes his bowl, enters a village or town, eats his fill, and returns to the monastery. He boasts to the bhikkhus: ‘I receive food, robes, alms, bedding, and medicine! Others, lacking merit and power, get nothing!’ Overcome by gains, he despises virtuous bhikkhus. For that fool, this brings long-lasting harm and suffering.  
5. Bhikkhus! Such gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
6. Bhikkhus! Train yourselves thus."  

[6] Sixth: The Thunderbolt  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful... obstacles.  
3. Bhikkhus! How does a thunderbolt—gains, honors, and renown—strike a trainee whose mind is unsteady?  
4. Bhikkhus! The thunderbolt is gains, honors, and renown.  
5. Bhikkhus! Such gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
6. Bhikkhus! Train yourselves thus."  

[7] Seventh: The Poisoned Arrow  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful... obstacles.  
3. Bhikkhus! How does a poisoned arrow—gains, honors, and renown—pierce a trainee whose mind is unsteady?  
4. Bhikkhus! The arrow is gains, honors, and renown.  
5. Bhikkhus! Such gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
6. Bhikkhus! Train yourselves thus."  

[8] Eighth: The Jackal  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful... obstacles.  
3. Bhikkhus! Have you heard the cry of a jackal at night?" "Yes, Venerable Sir."  
4. "Bhikkhus! An old jackal afflicted with mange finds no joy in open spaces, under trees, or in the open air. Wherever it walks, stands, sits, or lies, it meets misery.  
5. Bhikkhus! Similarly, a bhikkhu overcome by gains, honors, and renown, with mind deluded, finds no joy in solitude, under trees, or in the open air. Wherever he walks, stands, sits, or lies, he meets misery.  
6. Bhikkhus! Such gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
7. Bhikkhus! Train yourselves thus."  

[9] Ninth: The Whirlwind  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful... obstacles.  
3. Bhikkhus! Suppose a whirlwind blows in the sky. If a bird flies into it, the whirlwind scatters its legs, wings, head, and body in all directions.  
4. Bhikkhus! Similarly, a bhikkhu overcome by gains, honors, and renown, with mind deluded, robes himself in the morning, takes his bowl, and enters a village or town unrestrained in body, speech, or mind, lacking mindfulness.  
5. Seeing a poorly dressed or shameless woman, his mind is assailed by lust. He abandons training, returns to lay life, and is swept away like the bird in the whirlwind.  
6. Bhikkhus! Such gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
7. Bhikkhus! Train yourselves thus."  

[10] Tenth: The Verses  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus! Gains, honors, and renown are dreadful... obstacles.  
3. Bhikkhus! I have seen a bhikkhu overcome by offerings, his mind deluded. After death, he is reborn in a miserable realm.  
4. I have seen a bhikkhu overcome by lack of offerings, his mind deluded. After death, he is reborn in a miserable realm.  
5. I have seen a bhikkhu overcome by both offerings and lack of offerings, his mind deluded. After death, he is reborn in a miserable realm.  
6. Bhikkhus! Such gains, honors, and renown are dreadful...  
7. Bhikkhus! Train yourselves thus."  
8. The Blessed One said this. Then the Fortunate One, the Teacher, added:  

(1) Whether receiving offerings  
Or not receiving them,  
Unshaken in both states, steadfast—  

(2) Striving in meditation,  
Gaining insight, delighting in cessation—  
Such a one is called excellent.
