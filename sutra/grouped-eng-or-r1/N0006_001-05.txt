5. The Burning Chapter  

[41] 1. Burning Now  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.  

2. Then a deity, illuminating the entire Jeta's Grove with surpassing radiance at the break of dawn, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.  

3. Standing to one side, the deity recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:  

4. When a house is burning with flames,  
The items carried out are safe.  
But whatever remains in that house  
Will be consumed by fire.  

Similarly, in this world ablaze with aging and death,  
Give generously and carry forth your wealth.  
What is given yields pleasant fruits,  
But what is not given does not.  

By thieves or rulers, such wealth is seized,  
Lost in fires or destroyed.  
At life's end, all is abandoned.  
The wise understand this:  
Enjoy wealth while giving well,  
For unrestrained giving bears heavenly rewards.  

[42] 2. What to Give  

1. [Deity:] What grants strength? What grants beauty?  
What brings comfort? What brings vision?  
What grants all things? Answer me this.  

2. [Blessed One:] Food grants strength, clothes grant beauty.  
A vehicle grants comfort; a lamp grants vision.  
Shelter grants all necessities.  
The gift of Dharma grants immortality.  

[43] 3. Nourishment  

1. [Deity:] All beings—gods and humans—  
Delight in food. But what beings exist  
Who take no joy in nourishment?  

2. [Blessed One:] Those who give food with pure faith  
Gain sustenance in this life and beyond.  
Vanquish stinginess, give generously,  
Cleanse your vision of faults.  
Merit becomes their refuge  
In the crossing to future lives.  

[44] 4. The Single Root  

1. [Deity:] A single root—ignorance—divides  
Into two: eternalism and nihilism.  
Three poisons—greed, hate, delusion;  
Five sense-pleasures entrap.  
Twelve sense-bases whirl like eddies;  
The sea of craving never fills.  
Hell-pits trap fools, but sages cross beyond.  

[45] 5. The Perfected One  

1. [Deity:] Flawless in name and insight,  
Free from lust, renouncing desire,  
Wise and treading the noble path—  
Such a sage attains the highest.  

[46] 6. Heavenly Maidens  

1. [Deity:] Served by heavenly nymphs,  
This grove of fools—how to escape?  

2. [Blessed One:] Let truth be your path, fearlessness your ground.  
A chariot rolls silently, its wheel complete.  
Shame guards the platform, mindfulness the canopy.  
Dharma steers; right view leads.  
Ride this chariot—woman or man—  
Crossing safely to Nibbāna's shore.  

[47] 7. Plantations  

1. [Deity:] Whose merits grow day and night,  
Virtuous and Dhamma-abiding,  
Ascending to heavenly realms?  

2. [Blessed One:] Planters of groves and gardens,  
Bridge-builders, well-diggers,  
Providers of resthouses—  
Their merits grow endlessly.  
Dhamma-dwellers, virtuous and wise,  
Travel the path to celestial heights.  

[48] 8. Jeta's Grove  

1. [Deity:] This Grove of Jeta's sanctity,  
Where noble Sangha dwells—  
Here the Dhamma-King resides.  
Joy arises in my heart.  

Through virtue, wisdom, right conduct,  
And livelihood justly earned,  
The wise purify themselves,  
Not through clan or wealth.  

Reflecting on self and Dharma,  
Cleansed by virtue and wisdom,  
They reach peace like Sariputta,  
Monks supreme who cross beyond.  

[49] 9. Stinginess  

1. [Deity:] Stingy ones who hoard and curse beggars,  
Even obstructing others’ gifts—  
What birth awaits such beings?  

2. [Blessed One:] Stingy ones who hoard and scorn,  
Obstructing givers and receivers,  
Reborn in hell, animal realms, or ghostly worlds.  
If reborn as humans, they dwell in poverty,  
Finding no ease in clothes or food.  
Fools crave fleeting pleasures,  
But in darkness they sink.  

3. [Deity:] We grasp your teaching—now tell us this:  
Kind-hearted givers, free from greed,  
Devoted to Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha—  
What rebirth follows such virtue?  

4. [Blessed One:] Generous souls brighten heavens,  
Or if reborn among humans,  
Enjoy wealth unbounded.  
Past merits yield ease,  
Future births bring celestial peace.  

[50] 10. The Potter  

1. [Potter:] Seven monks, liberated and risen,  
Craving and hatred extinguished—  
Who transcends Death's realm?  
Who discards mortal and heavenly bonds?  

Upaka, Bheraṇḍaka, Phussatissa third,  
Bhaṅtiya, Khaṇḍadeva, Bāhuraggi, Piṅgiya—  
These shed human forms,  
Breaking celestial yokes.  

2. [Blessed One:] How they escaped Māra’s snare—  
What path severed existence’s bonds?  

3. [Potter:] No law exists outside the Buddha’s.  
Name-and-form annihilated,  
No remnant remains—  
Thus they cut all fetters.  

4. [Blessed One:] Profound are your words. Whose teaching do you know?  

5. [Potter:] In past lives, a potter I was,  
In Yeḷanāḷa village.  
A lay disciple of Kassapa Buddha,  
Chaste and pure.  
Former friend of yours,  
Now guide to seven monks—  
Greed and hate destroyed,  
Worldly cravings overpassed.  

6. [Blessed One:] Bhaggava, your words align:  
Once a potter, then pure sage,  
Friend from ancient days.  

7. Through lofty practice perfected,  
Two final bodies reunite—  
Truth’s reunion shown.  

Summary Verses:  

Burning, giving, the single root,  
Perfection, nymphs, plantations, groves,  
Stinginess, the potter—thus concludes.
