5. The Bhikkhuni Samyutta  
[1] First: Alavika  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi at Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.  
2. Then, in the morning, the Bhikkhuni Alavika dressed, took her bowl and robe, and entered Savatthi for alms. After wandering for alms in Savatthi and finishing her meal, she put away her bowl and entered a dark forest for seclusion.  
3. Then Mara the Evil One, wishing to cause fear, terror, and hair-raising in the Bhikkhuni Alavika, to make her abandon seclusion, approached her and addressed her in verse:  
"There is no escape from the world—why seek seclusion? Indulge in sensual pleasures, lest you later regret it."  
4. Then the Bhikkhuni Alavika thought: "Who spoke this verse—a human or a non-human?"  
5. Then she thought: "This is Mara the Evil One, who wishes to cause fear, terror, and hair-raising in me, to make me abandon seclusion, and thus he speaks this verse."  
6. Knowing it was Mara, the Bhikkhuni Alavika replied to him in verse:  
"There is an escape from the world—I discern it through wisdom. O malicious Mara, you do not know this path. Sensual pleasures are like swords and spears; the aggregates are their execution block. What you call enjoyment holds no joy for me."  
7. Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, "Alavika the Bhikkhuni knows me!" sorrowful and dejected, vanished on the spot.  

[2] Second: Soma  
1. At Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the Bhikkhuni Soma dressed, took her bowl and robe, and entered Savatthi for alms.  
2. After wandering for alms in Savatthi and finishing her meal, she put away her bowl and entered a dark forest for the day’s abiding. Seated at the foot of a tree, she dwelled there for the day.  
3. Then Mara the Evil One, wishing to cause fear, terror, and hair-raising in the Bhikkhuni Soma, to make her abandon meditation, approached her and said in verse:  
"The state attained by the sages is hard to reach. A woman with her two-finger wisdom cannot achieve it."  
4. Then the Bhikkhuni Soma thought: "Who spoke this verse—a human or a non-human?"  
5. She then realized: "This is Mara the Evil One, who wishes to cause fear, terror, and hair-raising in me, to make me abandon meditation."  
6. Knowing it was Mara, she replied in verse:  
"What does womanhood matter when the mind is stilled, wisdom arises, and one sees the truth? To one who clings to ‘man’ or ‘woman,’ Mara’s words take hold."  
7. Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, "Soma the Bhikkhuni knows me!" sorrowful and dejected, vanished on the spot.  

[3] Third: Gotami  
1. At Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the Bhikkhuni Kisagotami dressed, took her bowl and robe, and entered Savatthi for alms.  
2. After wandering for alms and finishing her meal, she put away her bowl and entered a dark forest for the day’s abiding. Seated at the foot of a tree, she dwelled there.  
3. Then Mara the Evil One approached her and said: "Why do you grieve, childless and alone? Sitting solitary in the forest—are you seeking a man?"  
4. She thought: "Who speaks this—human or non-human?"  
5. Realizing it was Mara, she replied:  
"Past are the days of mourning sons. No longing for men remains. I grieve no more. I dwell breaking through the dark, crushing death’s army, having ended all defilements."  
6. Then Mara, realizing she knew him, sorrowfully vanished.  

[4] Fourth: Vijayā  
1. At Savatthi. The Bhikkhuni Vijayā, after alms, sat at a tree’s foot.  
2. Mara approached her: "You’re young and lovely. Let us enjoy the five pleasures together!"  
3. She realized it was Mara and replied:  
"Forms, sounds, tastes, scents, and touches—all I return to you. This foul, fragile body I abhor. Cutting off craving, I’ve dispelled darkness, escaping Mara’s realm."  
4. Defeated, Mara vanished.  

[5] Fifth: Uppalavannā  
1. At Savatthi. The Bhikkhuni Uppalavannā stood beneath a flowering sal tree.  
2. Mara approached her: "Fair one beneath flowering trees—alone, unmatched beauty! Fool—do you not fear villains?"  
3. She replied: "Though a hundred thousand villains like you come, I stir not. I fear you not."  
4. Mara said: "I’ll vanish into your belly or stand between your brows!"  
5. She replied: "My heart is free, faculties mastered. I’m liberated—thus unafraid."  
6. Defeated, Mara vanished.  

[6] Sixth: Cālā  
1. At Savatthi. The Bhikkhuni Cālā sat beneath a tree.  
2. Mara asked: "What do you dislike?" "Birth." "Why dislike birth?" "Born, one suffers."  
3. She replied: "The Buddha taught to conquer birth. Cutting bonds, I dwell in truth. Those clinging to form and formless realms return—I’ve seen through these."  
4. Mara vanished.  

[7] Seventh: Upacālā  
1. At Savatthi. The Bhikkhuni Upacālā sat beneath a tree.  
2. Mara asked: "Where do you wish to be reborn?"  
3. "Nowhere."  
4. Mara urged: "Choose among the heavens—Yama, Tusita, Nimmānarati, or Paranimmita!"  
5. She replied: "Heavens are Mara’s realm. The world burns, smokes, and quakes. I seek the unshaken, beyond your reach."  
6. Mara vanished.  

[8] Eighth: Sisupacālā  
1. At Savatthi. The Bhikkhuni Sisupacālā sat beneath a tree.  
2. Mara asked: "Whose creed do you follow?"  
3. "None."  
4. Mara taunted: "Whose teaching made you shaven? Who pleases you?"  
5. She replied: "Beyond creeds, I follow the Buddha—smasher of Mara, all-seeing, taint-free. His teaching delights me."  
6. Mara vanished.  

[9] Ninth: Selā  
1. At Savatthi. The Bhikkhuni Selā sat beneath a tree.  
2. Mara demanded: "Who made this body? Where is its source and end?"  
3. She replied: "No self-made or other-made body. From causes it arises and ceases. Like seeds in soil, dependent on moisture, aggregates arise—from causes, they fade."  
4. Mara vanished.  

[10] Tenth: Vajirā  
1. At Savatthi. The Bhikkhuni Vajirā entered a dark forest.  
2. Mara asked: "Who created this being? Where is the maker?"  
3. She replied: "‘Being’ is mere convention. Like ‘chariot’ for parts, aggregates make ‘being.’ Suffering arises and ceases—no one beyond the process."  
4. Mara vanished.
