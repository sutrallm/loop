4. Sitting there, the Blessed One said: "Kassapa, are you enduring? Are you comfortable? Are your pains subsiding and not increasing? Is their decline apparent, not their growth?"  

5. "Lord, I cannot endure. I am not comfortable. My pains are severe and increasing, not subsiding. Their growth is apparent, not their decline."  

"Kassapa, the seven factors of enlightenment I have taught—when developed and cultivated—lead to direct knowledge, full enlightenment, and Nibbāna. What seven? Mindfulness... equanimity as factors of enlightenment." "Truly, Blessed One, these are factors of enlightenment!"
