6. Moggallāna Saṃyutta  
1. With Thought  

1. At that time, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  

2. There, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, bhikkhus!” Those bhikkhus replied to Venerable Mahā Moggallāna: “Friend!”  

3. Venerable Mahā Moggallāna said this: “Friends, while I was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in my mind: ‘What is called the first jhāna? What is the first jhāna?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This is called the first jhāna.’  

5. Friends, I myself, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, entered and dwelled in the first jhāna, accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. Friends, while I dwelt in this attainment, perceptions and intentions connected with sensual pleasures arose in me.  

6. Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me through spiritual power and said: ‘Moggallāna! Moggallāna! Brahmin, do not be heedless regarding the first jhāna. Steady your mind in the first jhāna, unify your mind in the first jhāna, concentrate your mind in the first jhāna.’  

7. Friends, afterward, I again secluded myself from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, entered and dwelled in the first jhāna, accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.  

8. Friends, if one rightly says: ‘Through the Teacher’s special grace, the disciple attains great universal knowledge,’ such a statement would rightly be made concerning me: ‘Through the Teacher’s special grace, the disciple attains great universal knowledge.’”  

2. Without Thought  

3. ...“‘What is called the second jhāna? What is the second jhāna?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, with the fading away of thought and examination, enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal clarity and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and is filled with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. This is called the second jhāna.’  

5. Friends, I myself, with the fading away of thought and examination, entered and dwelled in the second jhāna, which has internal clarity and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and is filled with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. Friends, while I dwelt in this attainment, perceptions and intentions connected with thought arose in me.  

6. Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me through spiritual power and said: ‘Moggallāna! Brahmin, do not be heedless regarding the second jhāna. Steady your mind in the second jhāna, unify your mind in the second jhāna, concentrate your mind in the second jhāna.’  

7. Friends, afterward, I again entered and dwelled in the second jhāna with the fading away of thought and examination...  

8. Friends, if one rightly says... this statement would rightly be made concerning me...”  

3. Joy  

3. ...“‘What is called the third jhāna? What is the third jhāna?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, with the fading away of rapture, dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly aware, experiencing pleasure with the body. He enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: “He is equanimous, mindful, dwelling in pleasure.” This is called the third jhāna.’  

5. Friends, I myself, with the fading away of rapture... entered and dwelled in the third jhāna...  

8. ...this statement would rightly be made concerning me...”  

4. Equanimity  

3. ...“‘What is called the fourth jhāna? What is the fourth jhāna?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and is purified by equanimity and mindfulness. This is called the fourth jhāna.’  

5. Friends, I myself... entered and dwelled in the fourth jhāna...  

8. ...this statement would rightly be made concerning me...”  

5. The Base of Infinite Space  

3. ...“‘What is called the base of infinite space? What is the base of infinite space?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, transcending all perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, not attending to diverse perceptions, perceives: “Space is infinite.” He enters and dwells in the base of infinite space. This is called the base of infinite space.’  

5. Friends, I myself... entered and dwelled in the base of infinite space...  

8. ...this statement would rightly be made concerning me...”  

6. The Base of Infinite Consciousness  

3. ...“‘What is called the base of infinite consciousness? What is the base of infinite consciousness?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, transcending the base of infinite space, perceives: “Consciousness is infinite.” He enters and dwells in the base of infinite consciousness. This is called the base of infinite consciousness.’  

5. Friends, I myself... entered and dwelled in the base of infinite consciousness...  

8. ...this statement would rightly be made concerning me...”  

7. The Base of Nothingness  

3. ...“‘What is called the base of nothingness? What is the base of nothingness?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, transcending the base of infinite consciousness, perceives: “There is nothing.” He enters and dwells in the base of nothingness. This is called the base of nothingness.’  

5. Friends, I myself... entered and dwelled in the base of nothingness...  

8. ...this statement would rightly be made concerning me...”  

8. The Base of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception  

3. ...“‘What is called the base of neither perception nor non-perception? What is the base of neither perception nor non-perception?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, transcending the base of nothingness, enters and dwells in the base of neither perception nor non-perception. This is called the base of neither perception nor non-perception.’  

5. Friends, I myself... entered and dwelled in the base of neither perception nor non-perception...  

8. ...this statement would rightly be made concerning me...”  

9. Signless Concentration  

3. ...“‘What is called signless concentration of mind? What is signless concentration of mind?’  

4. Friends, I thought: ‘Here, a bhikkhu, not attending to all signs, enters and dwells in signless concentration of mind. This is called signless concentration of mind.’  

5. Friends, I myself... entered and dwelled in signless concentration...  

8. ...this statement would rightly be made concerning me...”  

10. Sakka  

1. At that time, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  

2. Then, Venerable Mahā Moggallāna—just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm—disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in the Tāvatiṃsa heaven.  

3. Then Sakka, lord of the gods, approached Venerable Mahā Moggallāna with five hundred deities, paid homage to him, and stood to one side.  

4. Venerable Mahā Moggallāna said to Sakka: “Lord of the gods, take refuge in the Buddha. By taking refuge in the Buddha, beings here who pass away may be reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world. Take refuge in the Dhamma... Take refuge in the Saṅgha...”  

5. Sakka replied: “Venerable Moggallāna, take refuge in the Buddha... Dhamma... Saṅgha...”  

[Repeated increments of deities (six hundred, seven hundred, etc.) follow the same pattern, advising refuge in the Triple Gem.]  

18–62. [Parallel exchanges between Moggallāna and Sakka, expanding on the tenfold superiority of devas who take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha, and maintain pure virtue. Instances replicate earlier structures with increasing numbers of deities.]  

11. Candana Deva  
[Text parallels previous sections, substituting “Candana deva” for Sakka. Full replication omitted per “expand similarly” notation.]  

12. Sunimmita Deva  
13. Santusita Deva  
14. Nimmānarati Deva  
15. Paranimmitavasavatti Deva  
[Each repeats the structure of the Sakka section, replacing the deva’s name. Concludes with the same doctrinal reaffirmations.]  

Conclusion  

This is the Moggallāna Saṃyutta.
