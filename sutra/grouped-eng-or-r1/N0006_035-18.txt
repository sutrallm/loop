3. The Chapter on the Ocean

187. The First Discourse on the Ocean

1. (2) "Bhikkhus, when the uninstructed worldling speaks of 'the ocean, the ocean,' this is not the ocean in the Noble One's Discipline. Bhikkhus, in the Noble One's Discipline, this is merely a great accumulation of water, a great flowing stream.

2. (3) Bhikkhus, the eye is a person's ocean; its current consists of forms. One who withstands the current of forms generated by the eye—this brahmin, bhikkhus, has crossed the eye's ocean with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons. Having gone beyond, the one who stands on firm ground is called a victor.

3. (4–8) Bhikkhus, the ear is... the nose is... the tongue is... the body is... the mind is a person's ocean; its current consists of mental phenomena. One who withstands the current of mental phenomena generated by the mind—this brahmin, bhikkhus, has crossed the mind's ocean with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons. Having gone beyond, the one who stands on firm ground is called a victor."

4. (9) The Teacher declared:  
One who has crossed the ocean’s floods,  
Haunted by sharks, demons, waves,  
The wise one, accomplished in knowledge,  
Who has lived the holy life,  
Reaching the world’s end, is called  
One who has gone beyond.

188. The Second Discourse on the Ocean

1. (2) "Bhikkhus, when the uninstructed worldling speaks of 'the ocean, the ocean,' this is not the ocean in the Noble One's Discipline. Bhikkhus, in the Noble One's Discipline, this is merely a great accumulation of water, a great flowing stream.

2. (3) Bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, pleasing, charming, and enticing, arousing sensual desire—this, bhikkhus, is called the ocean in the Noble One's Discipline. Here, the world—with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, brahmins, devas, and humans—mostly remains submerged, tangled like thread, knotted like a ball of string, covered with blight, unable to pass beyond the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the abyss of saṃsāra.

3. (4–8) Sounds cognizable by the ear... Odors cognizable by the nose... Tastes cognizable by the tongue... Tactile objects cognizable by the body... Mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are agreeable, pleasing, charming, and enticing, arousing sensual desire—this, bhikkhus, is called the ocean in the Noble One's Discipline. Here, the world... [as above]... unable to pass beyond the abyss of saṃsāra."

189. The Third Discourse on the Fisherman

1. (2) "When a person abandons lust, hatred, and delusion, they cross this ocean with its sharks, demons, and waves, so hard to escape.

2. Having transcended attachment,  
Destroyed the stains of existence,  
They do not undergo rebirth;  
They’ve entered the cessation of suffering, beyond reckoning,  
Having left behind Death’s domain."

3. (3) "Bhikkhus, just as a fisherman casts a baited hook into a deep lake, and a fish with keen eyesight swallows it. That fish, bhikkhus, having swallowed the fisherman’s hook, meets with calamity, meets with disaster, falling under the fisherman’s control. Similarly, bhikkhus, these six hooks in the world are for the calamity and ruin of beings. What six?

4. (4) Bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, pleasing, charming, and enticing, arousing sensual desire. If a bhikkhu delights in them, praises them, and persists in clinging to them, this bhikkhu has swallowed Māra’s hook, meeting calamity, disaster, falling under Māra’s control.

5. (5–9) Sounds... Odors... Tastes... Tactile objects... Mental phenomena cognizable by the mind... [as above]... falling under Māra’s control.

6. (10) Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who does not delight in, praise, or cling to agreeable forms... does not swallow Māra’s hook. Breaking the hook, destroying it, they do not meet calamity or disaster, nor fall under Māra’s control.

7. (11–15) Sounds... Mental phenomena... [as above]... they do not fall under Māra’s control."

190. The Fourth Discourse on the Milky Tree

1. (2–6) "Bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī in whom desire, hatred, or delusion toward forms cognizable by the eye has not been abandoned—if even a minor form comes into their range, it overwhelms their mind. How much more so a major one? Because desire, hatred, and delusion are not abandoned...

2. (7) Similarly, bhikkhus, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī in whom desire, hatred, or delusion toward mental phenomena has not been abandoned—if even a minor mental phenomenon comes into their range, it overwhelms their mind. Because desire, hatred, and delusion are not abandoned...

3. (8) Suppose, bhikkhus, a young milk tree—an aśvattha, nyagrodha, pilakṣa, or udumbara—is struck with a sharp axe. Would it ooze sap?"  
"Yes, venerable sir. Why? Because there is sap."

4. (9–15) Similarly, bhikkhus, if desire, hatred, and delusion have not been abandoned... [the mind is overwhelmed].

5. (16) But if desire, hatred, and delusion are abandoned, even major forms... do not overwhelm the mind. Like an old, dry, milkless tree struck with an axe, no sap flows. Why? Because there is no sap. Similarly, one free from defilements remains unshaken."

191. The Fifth Discourse with Koṭṭhika

1. (3–7) "Friend Sāriputta, is the eye the fetter of forms, or are forms the fetter of the eye?"  
"No, friend. The fetter is the desire and lust arising from the two. Just as two oxen, one black and one white, yoked by a single collar, are mutually bound. The eye and forms, through desire, are fettered... Thus, the holy life is lived for the ending of suffering."

2. (8–9) "The Blessed One has vision but is freed from lust. So too, the ear... mind... [are not bound when desire is absent]."

192. The Sixth Discourse with Kāmabhū

[Identical to §191, replacing "Koṭṭhika" with "Kāmabhū."]

193. The Seventh Discourse with Udāyī

1. (3–9) "Friend Ānanda, does consciousness belong to self?"  
"The Buddha teaches that dependent on eye and forms arises eye-consciousness... When conditions cease, consciousness ceases. Thus, the body and consciousness are not self."

2. (10–11) "Like a man seeking heartwood, finding a banana tree: cutting it down, he finds no core. Similarly, a bhikkhu unattached to the six senses... realizes nirvāṇa."

194. The Eighth Discourse on Burning

1. (2–7) "Bhikkhus, better to have a red-hot iron spike pierce the eye than grasp signs and features of forms. For one who dies thus, hell or animal rebirth follows... Same for ear... mind... sleep. Sleep is barren and deluding.

2. (8–13) Contemplate the impermanence of the eye, forms, consciousness, contact, and feelings... Dispassion arises, leading to liberation.

3. (14–15) Through dispassion, release. Knowing: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life fulfilled, done what is to be done; no further becoming.'"

195. The Ninth Discourse on Hand-and-Foot Simile (1)

1. (1–4) "With hands, grasping; feet, moving; belly, hunger. With the eye... mind: contact leads to pleasure and pain. Without them, no contact, no feelings."

196. The Tenth Discourse on Hand-and-Foot Simile (2)

1. (1–4) "With hands, grasping exists... Without the eye... mind, contact does not arise, no feelings occur."

Final Summary:  
Two Oceans, Fisherman, Milky Tree,  
Koṭṭhika, Kāmabhū, Udāyī,  
Burning, two Hand-and-Foot,  
Thus ends the third chapter.
