4. The Blessed One said: "Monk, knowing and seeing the eye as impermanent, one abandons ignorance and gives rise to clarity. Knowing and seeing forms as impermanent, one abandons ignorance and gives rise to clarity. Knowing and seeing eye-consciousness... eye-contact... whatever feeling arises conditioned by eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—as impermanent, one abandons ignorance and gives rise to clarity.  

5-8. Ear... sounds... nose... scents... tongue... tastes... body... tactile sensations...

3. What is the Dhamma for the full understanding of all clinging?  

4. Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is eye-contact. From eye-contact arises feeling. Monks, when a learned noble disciple knows and sees thus, they become dispassionate toward the eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling. Dispassionate, they become detached. Through detachment, they are liberated. In liberation, they understand: 'I have fully understood clinging.'
