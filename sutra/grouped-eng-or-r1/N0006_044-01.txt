10. Avyakata Saṃyutta

1. Cāḷā Sutta

1. At one time, the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī, in the Eastern Park, at the storied mansion of Migāra’s mother.

2. Now at that time, the bhikkhunī Cālā was wandering in the Kosala country and had taken up residence between Sāketa and Sāvatthī, in the Toraṇavāṭa district.

3. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went from Sāketa to Sāvatthī and took up one night’s lodging in Toraṇavāṭa between Sāketa and Sāvatthī.

4. King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed a certain man: “Go, good man, find some ascetic or brahmin in this Toraṇavāṭa district whom I can visit today out of respect.”

“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. After searching the entire Toraṇavāṭa district, he did not see any ascetic or brahmin whom King Pasenadi could visit out of respect.

5. Then that man saw the bhikkhunī Cālā residing in Toraṇavāṭa. Having seen her, he approached King Pasenadi of Kosala and said: “Your Majesty, there is no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavāṭa whom Your Majesty could visit out of respect. However, there is a bhikkhunī named Cālā, a female disciple of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. She has a good reputation, being learned, wise, intelligent, a skilled speaker, and endowed with wisdom. Let Your Majesty visit her out of respect.”

6. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the bhikkhunī Cālā, paid homage to her, and sat down to one side.

7. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi said to the bhikkhunī Cālā: “Venerable lady, does the Tathāgata exist after death?”

“Great king, the Blessed One has not declared that ‘the Tathāgata exists after death.’”

8. “Then, venerable lady, does the Tathāgata not exist after death?”

“Great king, the Blessed One has not declared that ‘the Tathāgata does not exist after death.’”

9. “Then, venerable lady, does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death?”

“Great king, the Blessed One has not declared that ‘the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.’”

10. “Then, venerable lady, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?”

“Great king, the Blessed One has not declared that ‘the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’”

11. “When asked: ‘Venerable lady, does the Tathāgata exist after death?’ you say: ‘The Blessed One has not declared that.’ When asked: ‘Does the Tathāgata not exist after death?’ ... ‘Does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death?’ ... ‘Does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?’ you say: ‘The Blessed One has not declared that.’ What is the cause, venerable lady, what is the reason why the Blessed One has not declared this?”

12. “Then, great king, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer as you see fit.”

13. “Great king, what do you think? Is there any accountant, actuary, or calculator who could count the sand in the Ganges River as ‘so many grains of sand’ or ‘so many hundreds of grains’ or ‘so many thousands of grains’?”

“No, venerable lady, that is impossible.”

14. “Then, great king, is there any accountant, actuary, or calculator who could measure the water in the great ocean as ‘so many gallons of water’ or ‘so many hundreds of gallons’ or ‘so many thousands of gallons’?”

“No, venerable lady, that is impossible.”

“Why is that?”

“Venerable lady, the ocean is vast, deep, immeasurable, unfathomable.”

15. “In the same way, great king, whatever form by which one might define the Tathāgata—that form has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, rendered non-existent and incapable of arising in the future. The Tathāgata, great king, is liberated from reckoning in terms of form, deep, immeasurable, unfathomable, just like the ocean. Therefore, it is not proper to say: ‘The Tathāgata exists after death’; nor is it proper to say: ‘The Tathāgata does not exist after death’; nor that he both exists and does not exist; nor that he neither exists nor does not exist.

16–19. Whatever feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness by which one might define the Tathāgata—that consciousness has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, rendered non-existent and incapable of arising in the future. The Tathāgata, great king, is liberated from reckoning in terms of consciousness, deep, immeasurable, unfathomable, just like the ocean. Therefore, it is not proper to say: ‘The Tathāgata exists after death’ ... ‘does not exist after death’ ... ‘both exists and does not exist after death’ ... ‘neither exists nor does not exist after death.’”

20. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhunī Cālā’s words, rose from his seat, paid homage to her, and departed, keeping her on his right.

21. Later, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.

22. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, does the Tathāgata exist after death?”

“Great king, I have not declared that ‘the Tathāgata exists after death.’”

23. “Then, venerable sir, does the Tathāgata not exist after death?”

“Great king, I have not declared that ‘the Tathāgata does not exist after death.’”

24–25. [Similarly for both exists and does not exist, and neither exists nor does not exist.]

26. “Venerable sir, when asked these questions, you say you have not declared these points. What is the cause, venerable sir, what is the reason why you have not declared this?”

27. “Then, great king, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer as you see fit.”

28–29. [Similar questions about measuring the sand in the Ganges and water in the ocean.]

30–34. “In the same way, great king, whatever form ... feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness by which one might define the Tathāgata—that has been abandoned by the Tathāgata ... Therefore, it is not proper to say: ‘The Tathāgata exists after death’ ...”

35. “Wonderful, venerable sir! Marvelous, venerable sir! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple coincide and agree, without contradiction.”

36. “Venerable sir, once I approached the bhikkhunī Cālā and asked her this matter. She explained it to me in exactly the same terms as the Blessed One, with the same phrasing. Wonderful, venerable sir! How the teacher and disciple agree in meaning and phrasing without contradiction. Now, venerable sir, we must depart. We have many duties.”

“Great king, you may go at your convenience.”

37. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, paid homage, and departed, keeping him on his right.

2. Anurādha Sutta

1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the Great Wood, in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.

2. Now at that time, the Venerable Anurādha was dwelling in a forest hut nearby.

3. Then a number of wandering ascetics approached the Venerable Anurādha. After exchanging courteous greetings, they sat down to one side.

4. They said: “Friend Anurādha, the Tathāgata—the supreme man, the superlative man, who has attained the superlative attainment—is described in four ways: ‘The Tathāgata exists after death’; ‘does not exist after death’; ‘both exists and does not exist after death’; ‘neither exists nor does not exist after death.’”

“Friends, the Tathāgata—the supreme man—when described, is described apart from these four positions.”

5. Those wandering ascetics disapproved, saying: “This monk must be newly ordained or else an elder who is foolish and incompetent.”

6. After they left, Venerable Anurādha reflected: “If they ask me again, how should I answer so as to state the Blessed One’s position and not misrepresent him?”

7. He approached the Blessed One and related the exchange.

8. The Blessed One then questioned him on the impermanent and suffering nature of the five aggregates.

9–12. Through this line of questioning, Anurādha realized that none of the aggregates can be identified as the self or belonging to the self.

13–21. When Anurādha affirmed that the Tathāgata cannot be identified with any of the aggregates or apart from them, the Buddha confirmed that the Tathāgata’s nature is beyond all conceptual proliferation.

22. “Good, Anurādha! Both formerly and now, I teach only suffering and the cessation of suffering.”

3. Sāriputta-Koṭṭhika Sutta (1: Abiding)

1. At one time, Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita were dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana.

2–7. When asked why the Buddha does not declare the Tathāgata's status after death, Sāriputta explains that such views are based on clinging to the aggregates.

8–12. Each of the four positions (exists, does not exist, both, neither) involves clinging to form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, or consciousness.

13. “Therefore, the Tathāgata does not declare these positions.”

4. Sāriputta-Koṭṭhika Sutta (2: Arising)

Similarly, the failure to fully understand the arising and ceasing of the aggregates leads to such speculative views, while full understanding eliminates them.

5. Sāriputta-Koṭṭhika Sutta (3: Affection)

The clinging and affection for the aggregates lead to such views. Letting go of such clinging removes the basis for these views.

6. Sāriputta-Koṭṭhika Sutta (4: Delight)

Delight in the aggregates, formations, existence, clinging, and craving underlies the four positions. Eliminating delight removes their basis.

7. Moggallāna Sutta

Venerable Mahāmoggallāna similarly explains to the wanderer Vacchagotta that the Buddha does not hold any view about the Tathāgata after death, as such views stem from identifying with the aggregates.

8. Vacchagotta Sutta

The Buddha himself explains to Vacchagotta that holding any view about the Tathāgata after death involves clinging to the aggregates as self.

9. Debating Hall

Vacchagotta recounts a debate among wanderers about various teachers' doctrines, questioning the Buddha’s teaching of liberation through the destruction of craving. The Buddha compares craving to the fuel of a fire; when craving is extinguished, no basis for rebirth remains.

10. Ānanda Sutta

The Buddha explains to Ānanda that answering Vacchagotta’s questions with “I exist” or “I do not exist” would wrongly affirm eternalism or annihilationism, contradicting the teaching of not-self.

11. Sabhiya Sutta

The wanderer Sabhiya questions Venerable Sabhiya Kaccāna on the Tathāgata’s post-mortem status. The elder explains that with the cessation of all conditions, no basis remains for such speculations.
