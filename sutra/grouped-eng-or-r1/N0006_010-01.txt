10. Yakkha Saṃyutta  

1. Indaka  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagāha, on Mount Indasāla, the abode of the yakkha Indaka.  

2. Then the yakkha Indaka approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:  

"The Buddhas say that form is not the soul. How then does life dwell in the body? Where do the bones and flesh come from? How is this being conceived in the mother’s womb?"  

3. [The Blessed One:] "First arises the kalala (embryonic state), from the kalala comes the abbuda (next stage). From the abbuda develops the flesh, from the flesh grows hard tissue. From the hard tissue, limbs and joints form. Hair, body hair, and nails also arise. The mother takes food and drink, and thereby the being in the womb grows.  

2. Sūciloma  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagāha, on Vulture Peak Mountain.  

2. Then the yakkha Sūciloma approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:  

"You, who are freed from all bonds, a liberated ascetic—why do you still teach others? This is not your duty."  

3. [The Blessed One:] "Sūciloma, even when interacting with beings in any form, a wise one is not attached. With a mind full of compassion and serenity, though he teaches others, he remains unbound, acting solely out of loving-kindness.  

3. Khara  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Gayā, on the Stone Bed, the abode of the yakkha Khara.  

2. Then the yakkhas Khara and Sūciloma passed near the Blessed One.  

3. Khara said to Sūciloma: "That is an ascetic."  

4. Sūciloma replied: "No, that is not an ascetic. At most, a petty ascetic. I will test whether he is an ascetic or not."  

5. Sūciloma then approached the Blessed One and pushed against his body.  

6. The Blessed One moved aside.  

7. Sūciloma asked: "Ascetic, are you afraid of me?"  

8. [The Blessed One:] "No, friend. I am not afraid, but contact with you is unwholesome."  

9. Sūciloma said: "I will question you. If you cannot answer, I will drive you mad, burst your heart, seize your feet, and throw you across the Ganges!"  

10. [The Blessed One:] "Friend, in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, among ascetics, brahmins, humans, and divinities, I see none who could do so. But ask as you wish."  

11. Sūciloma asked in verse:  
"From what arise greed and hatred?  
Joy, sorrow, and fear—from where do they spring?  
Like children freeing a bound bird—  
where do these mind’s thoughts originate?"  

12. [The Blessed One:] "Greed and hatred arise from craving.  
Joy, sorrow, and fear arise from oneself.  
Like shoots sprouting from a tree’s roots,  
thoughts arise from craving; the body comes from craving.  
Worldlings tangled in desires are like jungle vines.  
One who knows their cause destroys them.  
Listen, yakkha: he who crosses the flood,  
unshackled, will not be reborn again."  

4. Maṇibhadda  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Magadha, at the Maṇimālaka Shrine, the abode of the yakkha Maṇibhadda.  

2. Maṇibhadda addressed the Blessed One in verse:  
"Always mindful, one attains happiness;  
mindfulness brings bliss.  
Mindful each day brings fortune—  
such a one is freed from all enmity."  

3. [The Blessed One:] "Always mindful, one attains happiness;  
mindfulness brings bliss.  
Mindful each day brings fortune,  
yet complete freedom from anger comes  
when one’s mind, day and night, delights in harmlessness,  
radiates compassion to all beings—  
thus, no enmity remains."  

5. Sānu  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  

2. Then the laywoman Sānu’s son was possessed by a yakkha.  

3. Sānu lamented in verse:  
"I have heard the Arahants declare—  
on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth lunar days,  
observing the Uposatha with precepts—  
no yakkha can harm such a one.  
Yet today I see my son Sānu  
tormented by a yakkha! How is this so?"  

4. [The Yakkha replied:]  
"Only those truly awakened,  
keeping precepts pure in deed and word,  
harmless in conduct, are free from yakkhas.  
But if one, though observing rites, clings to evil,  
like a bird escaping a snare only to return—  
such a one cannot escape suffering."  

5. [Sānu:] "People weep for the dead or separated.  
I am alive—why does my mother weep?"  

6. [Sānu’s Mother:] "People weep for the dead or parted,  
but one who strays from virtue, though alive,  
is as good as dead. My son, escape the flames!  
Flee hell, never return. Who spoke these words to me?  
You, craving more, would burn again!"  

6. The Yakkha Child  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. He rose at dawn and recited the Dhamma verses.  

3. A yakkha mother said to her child:  
"Sweet Kāla, make no noise.  
That monk recites Dhamma. Knowing it,  
we too may benefit: abstain from killing,  
speak truth, practice virtue—  
thus escape this ghostly realm."  

7. Puṇabbasu  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. The Blessed One was teaching the bhikkhus about Nibbāna. Deeply attentive, they listened.  

3. Puṇabbasu’s yakkha mother said to her sons:  
"Silence, Uttara! Let Puṇabbasu be still.  
I listen to the Buddha’s supreme teaching.  
He speaks of Nibbāna, the end of bonds.  
Though I love my sons and husband,  
this Dhamma surpasses worldly loves.  
Hearing it, one escapes suffering,  
crosses the torrent of birth and death.  
Let me hear this Dhamma in peace!"  

4. [Puṇabbasu:] "Mother, we are silent.  
Hearing the Dhamma brings joy.  
Ignorant, we wandered in suffering.  
Now the Buddha, the Eye of the World,  
teaches the path to end all woes."  

5. [The Yakkha Mother:] "Well said, my wise son!  
Rejoicing in the Buddha’s pure Dhamma,  
I find peace. Son Puṇabbasu,  
you too listen. May we all escape saṃsāra,  
see the Noble Truths, and gain liberation!"  

8. Sudatta  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagāha, in the Cool Grove.  

2. Then the householder Sudatta (Anāthapiṇḍika) came to Rājagāha.  

3. Hearing "The Buddha has arisen," he sought to meet him.  

4. Thinking it too late, he resolved to go at dawn. Thrice that night he awoke, mistaking time.  

5. Approaching the charnel ground, deities opened the gates.  

6. Darkness fell; fear arose. He turned back.  

7. The yakkha Sīvaka spoke:  
"A hundred elephants, horses, chariots,  
maidens adorned with gems—  
all are worthless compared to a single step  
toward the Buddha. Press on, do not retreat!"  

8. Light returned; fear subsided.  

9–11. Thrice darkness came; thrice Sīvaka urged him onward, dispelling fear.  

12. Sudatta reached the Cool Grove.  

13. At dawn, the Blessed One was walking.  

14. Seeing Sudatta, he invited: "Come, Sudatta."  

15. Sudatta prostrated, asking: "Lord, did you rest well?"  

16. [The Blessed One:] "Free from flames of defilement,  
the Brahmin sleeps in peace.  
Detached from craving, cool, independent,  
cutting all ties, taming heart’s distress—  
calm, serene, such a one rests in bliss."  

9. Sukkā (1)  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagāha, in the Bamboo Grove.  

2. The bhikkhunī Sukkā was teaching a large assembly.  

3. A devout yakkha praised her in Rājagāha:  
"People of Rājagāha, why linger here?  
Drunk on wine, heedless, while Sukkā teaches  
the path to deathless nectar. Drink deep!  
Like parched travelers refreshed by rain,  
the wise never tire of Dhamma’s taste."  

10. Sukkā (2)  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagāha.  

2. A lay disciple offered alms to Sukkā.  

3. A devout yakkha praised him in Rājagāha:  
"Wise layman, feeding Sukkā freed from bonds—  
great merit is gained by such a deed!"  

11. Vīrā  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagāha.  

2. A lay disciple offered robes to the bhikkhunī Vīrā.  

3. A devout yakkha praised him in Rājagāha:  
"Wise layman, giving robes to Vīrā freed from bonds—  
great merit is gained by such a deed!"  

12. Āḷavaka  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Āḷavī, at the abode of the yakkha Āḷavaka.  

2. Āḷavaka ordered: "Ascetic, leave!" The Blessed One left. "Enter!" He entered.  

3–4. Thrice Āḷavaka commanded; thrice the Blessed One complied.  

5. At the fourth command, the Blessed One refused: "I will not leave. Do as you will."  

6. Āḷavaka threatened: "Answer my questions, or I will kill you!"  

7. [The Blessed One:] "None in all worlds can harm me. Ask freely."  

8. [Āḷavaka:]  
"What is humanity’s greatest wealth?  
What, well-practiced, brings bliss?  
What is the sweetest flavor?  
What life is the best life?"  

9. [The Blessed One:]  
"Faith is the greatest wealth.  
Dhamma well-practiced brings bliss.  
Truth is the sweetest flavor.  
A life of wisdom is the best."  

10. [Āḷavaka:]  
"How to cross the flood? The sea?  
Transcend suffering? Be purified?"  

11. [The Blessed One:]  
"By faith, cross the flood.  
By diligence, cross the sea.  
By effort, transcend suffering.  
By wisdom, be purified."  

12. [Āḷavaka:]  
"How gain wisdom? Wealth? Fame?  
How win friends? How, passing hence,  
grieve not hereafter?"  

13. [The Blessed One:]  
"Listen to the Noble Ones, seek Nibbāna.  
Heedful, gain wisdom.  
Persevere for wealth. Speak truth for fame.  
Generosity wins friends.  
Those with faith, truth, restraint, and generosity  
cross beyond sorrow. In this world and the next,  
they grieve no more."  

14. Āḷavaka, satisfied, declared:  
"Now I know my future good!  
The Buddha came to Āḷavī.  
Gifts to him bear great fruit.  
I honor the Awakened One,  
the Dhamma’s truth. Henceforth,  
wandering village to village,  
I will proclaim his glory."
