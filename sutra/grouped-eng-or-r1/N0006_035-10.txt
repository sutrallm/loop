5. The Chapter on Relinquishment  

[94] 1. The Tamed (1)  
2. "Monks, when the six bases of contact are not restrained, guarded, protected, or mastered, they become a source of suffering. What are these six?  
3-7. Monks, when the eye is not restrained, guarded, protected, or mastered, it becomes a source of suffering. When the ear... nose... tongue... body...  
8. Monks, when the mind is not restrained, guarded, protected, or mastered, it becomes a source of suffering.  
9. Monks, when these six bases of contact are not restrained, guarded, protected, or mastered, they become a source of suffering.  
10. Monks, when these six bases of contact are well-restrained, well-guarded, well-protected, and well-mastered, they become a source of happiness. What are these six?  
11-15. Monks, when the eye is well-restrained... the ear... nose... tongue... body...  
16. Monks, when the mind is well-restrained, guarded, protected, and mastered, it becomes a source of happiness.  
17. Monks, when these six bases of contact are well-restrained..., they become a source of happiness."  
18. The Blessed One said this... and the Teacher further spoke thus:  
(1) "Monks, there are six bases of contact. Without guarding them, one meets suffering; guarding them, one dwells with faith, free from taints.  
(2) Seeing pleasant forms or unpleasant forms, guard against lust for the pleasant; regarding the unpleasant, think, 'This is not mine,' and let it not stain your mind.  
(3) Hearing pleasant or unpleasant sounds, do not give way to delight in the pleasant; guard against anger toward the unpleasant, thinking, 'This is not mine.'  
(4) Smelling a sweet or foul scent, guard against aversion to the foul; do not let desire arise toward the sweet.  
(5) Tasting sweet flavors, then bitter ones, do not cling to sweetness; hold no trace of anger toward bitterness.  
(6) Feeling pleasant contact, do not be intoxicated; feeling pain, remain unshaken. Toward pleasure and pain, dwell neutral, free from joy or anger.  
(7) Those deluded by perceptions, clinging to ideas, sink in lowly rebirths. Cut off the five cords of desire through renunciation.  
(8) When the mind is thus trained in the six bases, even when touched, it remains unshaken. Monks, overcoming greed and hate, one reaches the far shore of birth and death."  

[95] 2. The Tamed (2)  
2. Then the Venerable Malunkyaputta approached the Blessed One...  
3. Seated to one side, Malunkyaputta said: "Venerable sir, may the Blessed One briefly teach me the Dhamma. Having heard it, I will dwell alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute."  
4. "Malunkyaputta, you are old and aged. If young monks ask me for brief instruction, what shall I tell them?"  
5. "Venerable sir, though I am old, please teach me briefly. Let me grasp the meaning of the Blessed One’s words and become your disciple."  
6. "Malunkyaputta, what do you think? Have you ever seen, known, or encountered forms through the eye that you now do not see, know, or encounter? Would craving, lust, or affection arise toward them?" "No, venerable sir."  
7-10. (Similarly for sounds, smells, tastes, touches...)  
11. "For mental phenomena never before encountered through the mind, would craving arise?" "No, venerable sir."  
12. "Malunkyaputta, regarding things seen, heard, sensed, or cognized: see them as they are.  
13. Thus, Malunkyaputta, you are not entangled by greed, hate, or delusion. Unentangled, you do not cling to these experiences. Therefore, you are not here, hereafter, or in between—this is the end of suffering."  
14. "I understand the Blessed One’s brief teaching:  
(1) One attached internally, seeing forms, loses mindfulness; clinging arises, leading to suffering. Such accumulation distances one from Nibbana...  
(7) One undefiled by forms, guarding mindfulness, sees them as worldly experiences; suffering ceases. Dwelling thus, one nears Nibbana."  
15. "Good, Malunkyaputta! You understand correctly..."  
16. Delighted, Malunkyaputta rose, paid homage, and left.  
17. Dwelling alone, diligent, he soon attained arhatship, knowing: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life fulfilled; no more becoming."  
18. Thus, he became an arahant.  

[96] 3. Decline  
2. "Monks, I will teach decline, non-decline, and six grounds of mastery.  
3. What is decline?  
4. A monk sees a form with the eye, arising evil unwholesome thoughts. If he does not abandon them, he declines.  
5-9. (Similarly for sounds, smells, tastes, touches, mental phenomena.)  
10. This is decline.  
11. What is non-decline?  
12. A monk seeing forms with the eye, abandons evil thoughts.  
13-17. (Similarly for other senses.)  
18. This is non-decline.  
19. What are the six grounds of mastery?  
20. A monk, seeing forms with the eye, masters evil thoughts. He knows: 'This is supreme, the Master’s instruction.'  
21-25. (Similarly for other senses.)  
26. These are the six grounds of mastery."  

[97] 4. The Heedful  
2. "I will teach the heedless and heedful. Listen.  
3. The heedless:  
4. Not guarding the eye, his mind is stained by sights. Stained, joylessness arises; joylessness leads to restlessness, suffering, and unsettled mind. Unsettled, dhammas vanish—this is heedless.  
5-9. (Similarly for ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.)  
10. Such is the heedless.  
11. The heedful:  
12. Guarding the eye, his mind is unstained. Unstained, joy arises, leading to rapture, tranquility, ease, concentration, and dhammas manifesting—this is heedful.  
13-17. (Similarly for other senses.)  
18. Such is the heedful."  

[98] 5. Restraint  
2. "I will teach unrestraint and restraint.  
3. Unrestraint:  
4. Delighting in pleasant forms, craving arises. Knowing this leads to decline.  
5-9. (Similarly for sounds, smells, tastes, touches, mental phenomena.)  
10. Such is unrestraint.  
11. Restraint:  
12. Not delighting in pleasant forms, he does not decline.  
13-17. (Similarly for other senses.)  
18. Such is restraint."  

[99] 6. Concentration  
2. "Cultivate concentration. A concentrated monk knows reality.  
4. He knows the eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and arising feelings as impermanent.  
5-9. (Similarly for ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.)  
10. Cultivate concentration!"  

[100] 7. Seclusion  
2. "Cultivate seclusion. A secluded monk knows reality.  
4-9. He knows eye, forms... as impermanent.  
10. Cultivate seclusion!"  

[101] 8. Not Yours (1)  
2. "Monks, abandon what is not yours. Abandoning brings welfare.  
4. The eye, forms, eye-consciousness... are not yours. Abandon them.  
5-9. (Similarly for ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.)  
10. In Jeta’s Grove, can grass be claimed as 'ours'? No—it is 'not self.'  
11-16. Similarly, the senses are not yours. Abandon them!"  

[102] 9. Not Yours (2)  
2-9. (Same as [101] 2-9.)  

[103] 10. Uddaka  
2. "Uddaka Ramaputta declared: 'I am wise, victorious, uprooting suffering.' But he was not.  
3. The correct declaration is for one who knows:  
4-6. The wise know the six senses’ origin, end, allure, peril, and escape. The victorious cut craving—uprooting suffering.  
7-8. Uddaka spoke falsely. The true victor is free from greed, hate, and delusion."
