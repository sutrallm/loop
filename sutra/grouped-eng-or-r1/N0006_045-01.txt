1. First: The Chapter on Ignorance  
(1) First: Ignorance  

1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  
2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!”  
“Venerable sir!” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said:  
3. “Monks, with ignorance as the forerunner, unwholesome states arise, followed by lack of conscience and shame. Monks, in one who is ignorant, wrong view arises. With wrong view, wrong intention arises. With wrong intention, wrong speech arises. With wrong speech, wrong action arises. With wrong action, wrong livelihood arises. With wrong livelihood, wrong effort arises. With wrong effort, wrong mindfulness arises. With wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration arises.  
4. Monks, with wisdom as the forerunner, wholesome states arise, followed by conscience and shame. Monks, in one who is wise, right view arises. With right view, right intention arises. With right intention, right speech arises. With right speech, right action arises. With right action, right livelihood arises. With right livelihood, right effort arises. With right effort, right mindfulness arises. With right mindfulness, right concentration arises.”  

(2) Second: Half  

1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at a Sakyan town named Sāgala.  
2. Then Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and sat to one side. Seated there, he said: “Venerable sir, having good friends, good companions, and good associates is half of the spiritual life.”  
3. “Do not say so, Ānanda! Do not say so, Ānanda! Ānanda, having good friends, good companions, and good associates is the entire spiritual life. Ānanda, a monk with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to cultivate and develop the Noble Eightfold Path.  
4. Ānanda, how does a monk with good friends cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, a monk cultivates right view dependent on seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment. He cultivates right intention... right speech... right action... right livelihood... right effort... right mindfulness... right concentration dependent on seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment. Ānanda, in this way, a monk with good friends cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.  
5. Ānanda, by this method it may be understood: having good friends is the entire spiritual life. For beings subject to birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are liberated through me as their good friend. Therefore, know that good friendship is the entire spiritual life.”  

(3) Third: Sāriputta  

1. At Sāvatthī.  
2. Then Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and sat to one side. He said: “Venerable sir, having good friends, companions, and associates is the entire spiritual life.”  
3. “Good, good, Sāriputta! Having good friends is the entire spiritual life. A monk with good friends can cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.  
4. Sāriputta, how does such a monk cultivate it? He cultivates right view... right concentration dependent on seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment. Thus, he cultivates the path.  
5. By this, Sāriputta, know that good friendship is the entire spiritual life. Through me as their friend, beings are freed from suffering. Thus, good friendship is the entire spiritual life.”  

(4) Fourth: The Brahmin  

1. At Sāvatthī.  
2. Then Venerable Ānanda, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and entered Sāvatthī for alms.  
3. He saw the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī leaving the city in a white carriage with white horses, white ornaments, and attendants. People exclaimed, “This is the divine vehicle! This is Brahmā’s vehicle!”  
4. After almsround, Ānanda asked the Blessed One: “Can this Dhamma be called the divine vehicle?” The Blessed One said: “Ānanda, the Noble Eightfold Path is indeed the divine vehicle, the Dhamma vehicle, the supreme victory.  
5. By cultivating right view... right concentration, greed, hate, and delusion are utterly destroyed. Thus, the Eightfold Path is called the divine vehicle.”  

The Blessed One then spoke these verses:  
“Faith and wisdom as the yoke and pole,  
Mindfulness the charioteer,  
Virtue the carriage’s ornament,  
Stride toward safety with patience as armor,  
This supreme vehicle leads to peace—  
With wisdom, sages depart the world.”  

(5) Fifth: Purpose  

1. At Sāvatthī.  
2. Several monks asked the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, when asked why we follow the spiritual life under the Blessed One, we say, ‘To fully understand suffering.’ Is this correct?”  
3. The Blessed One replied: “Yes. If asked whether there is a path to understand suffering, affirm the Noble Eightfold Path: right view... right concentration. This is the way.”  

(6) Sixth: A Monk (1)  

1. At Sāvatthī.  
2. A monk asked: “What is the spiritual life? What is its culmination?”  
3. The Blessed One said: “The Noble Eightfold Path is the spiritual life. The destruction of greed, hate, and delusion is its culmination.”  

(7) Seventh: A Monk (2)  

1. At Sāvatthī.  
2. A monk asked: “What leads to the subduing of defilements?”  
3. The Blessed One said: “The subduing of greed, hate, and delusion is the deathless—Nibbāna. The path is the Noble Eightfold Path.”  

(8) Eighth: Analysis  

1. At Sāvatthī.  
2. The Blessed One said: “Monks, I will analyze the Noble Eightfold Path: right view... right concentration.  
3. Right view is understanding suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path.  
4. Right intention is thoughts of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness.  
5. Right speech is abstaining from false, divisive, harsh, and idle speech.  
6. Right action is abstaining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.  
7. Right livelihood is abstaining from wrong livelihood.  
8. Right effort is endeavoring to prevent unarisen unwholesome states...  
9. Right mindfulness is contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena.  
10. Right concentration is attaining the four jhānas.”  

(9) Ninth: The Spike  

1. At Sāvatthī.  
2. The Blessed One said: “Just as a wrongly held spike harms the hand, wrong practice cannot destroy ignorance. But rightly held, practice destroys ignorance and leads to Nibbāna.  
3. A monk cultivates right view... right concentration dependent on seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment. Thus, he attains liberation.”  

(10) Tenth: Nandī  

1. At Sāvatthī.  
2. The wanderer Nandī asked: “By practicing what does one reach Nibbāna?”  
3. The Blessed One said: “By practicing the Noble Eightfold Path: right view... right concentration.”  
4. Nandī then took refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha.
