[82] 1. The Teacher  

1. The Blessed One said: "Monks, one who does not truly understand aging-and-death, not having seen this, cannot neglect seeking a teacher to gain true knowledge of aging-and-death. One who does not truly understand the origin of aging-and-death, not having seen this, cannot neglect seeking a teacher to gain true knowledge of the origin of aging-and-death. One who does not truly understand the cessation of aging-and-death, not having seen this, cannot neglect seeking a teacher to gain true knowledge of the cessation of aging-and-death. One who does not truly understand the path leading to the cessation of aging-and-death, not having seen this, cannot neglect seeking a teacher to gain true knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging-and-death."
