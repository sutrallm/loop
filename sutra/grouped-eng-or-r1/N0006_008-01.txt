8. Vangisa Thera Samyutta

1. First: Renunciation

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, Venerable Vangisa was dwelling at Alavi with his teacher, Venerable Nigrodhakappa, in the Aggalava Shrine.

2. At that time, Venerable Vangisa, being a newly ordained monk, was left behind as the monastery caretaker.

3. At that time, many women came to the hermitage, adorned and dressed to visit the monastery.

4. Seeing those women, Venerable Vangisa became discontent, his mind tainted by lust.

5. Then Venerable Vangisa thought: "Discontent has arisen in me; my mind is tainted by lust. This is truly distressing. No one else can dispel this discontent and bring me joy. I must dispel this discontent myself and generate joy."

6. Then Venerable Vangisa dispelled his own discontent and generated joy. At that time, he recited these verses:
"Having left home for homelessness—  
My renunciation was indeed  
Born from thoughts of escaping darkness,  
The afflictions of existence.  

Though skilled in archery,  
The thousand masters of the bow  
Could not defend against  
The women who came to disturb my mind.  

Firmly established in the Dhamma,  
I once followed the path  
Taught by the Sakyan Buddha,  
Leading to Nirvana.  

Joyful in this teaching,  
I dwell; even if Mara comes,  
I shall shake him off  
So he cannot find my path."  

2. Second: Discontent

1. ... (Same as above up to verse 2)  

3. At that time, Venerable Nigrodhakappa returned from alms gathering, ate his meal, and entered his dwelling. From evening until dawn the next day, he did not emerge.

4. At that time, discontent arose in Venerable Vangisa; his mind was tainted by lust.

5. Vangisa thought: "Discontent has arisen in me... (as above)."  

6. Dispelling his discontent, he recited:
"One who abandons longing for pleasure and discontent,  
Rejecting attachment to household life,  
Dwells in desireless liberation—  
Such is a monk.  

All the earth and sky,  
Everything in the world,  
Is impermanent, subject to aging.  
The wise, understanding this, abide thus.  

Perceptions arising from seeing, hearing, thinking—  
None of these clingings remain.  
Free from taint and defilement,  
Such is called a sage.  

Ordinary folks easily fall  
Into sixty kinds of wrong views.  
Not entering such paths,  
A monk avoids evil speech.  

Endowed with heavenly insight,  
Long has his mind been calmed.  
Free from deceit and desire,  
The wise walk the peaceful path.  

Through Nirvana, the sage  
Extinguishes all troubles,  
Awaiting final liberation."  

3. Third: Disdaining Gentle Ones

1. ... (as above context)  

2. At that time, Venerable Vangisa, proud of his own quick wit, disdained other gentle monks.

3. Vangisa reflected: "Proud of my wit, disdaining others—this is truly distressing."

4. Repenting, he recited:
"Disciple of the Sakya, abandon conceit!  
The path beyond conceit has no trace.  
Drunk on pride’s path, regret soon follows.  

Repeatedly indulging in pride,  
People fall into hell.  
Long do they suffer there.  

But the victors on the path,  
Righteous monks, never grieve.  
Rejoicing in the Dhamma,  
They dwell not in arrogance.  

Striving free from hindrances,  
Cleansed of all conceit,  
By wisdom extinguishing defilements,  
The calm sage abides in peace."  

4. Fourth: Ananda

1. At one time, Venerable Ananda was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove.  

2. One morning, Ananda took his bowl and robe, with Vangisa as his attendant, to seek alms.  

3. Then discontent arose in Vangisa; his mind burned with lust.  

4. Addressing Ananda in verse:  
"I am burned by lust’s fire,  
My heart aflame!  
O Compassionate One, please teach  
The way to quench this blaze!"  

5. Ananda replied:  
"Through distorted perception,  
Your mind ignites.  
Reverse the impure view—  
See the foul as foul.  

Reflect on impermanence,  
Suffering, non-self.  
Extinguish great desire’s flames,  
Lest you burn again.  

Fix your mind on one point,  
Make it calm and still.  
Cultivate dispassion,  
Destroy latent pride.  

Through the signless liberation,  
Attain serene peace."  

5. Fifth: Well-Spoken

1. At Savatthi...  

2. The Buddha addressed the monks: "A well-spoken word has four qualities. It is good, blameless, and beyond reproach. What four?  

3. It is spoken rightly—not wrongly; in accordance with Dhamma—not against it; kindly—not harshly; truthfully—not falsely. Such speech is well-spoken."  

4. The Blessed One then recited:
"The best speech speaks what’s good,  
The second speaks the Dhamma.  
The third speaks gently,  
The fourth speaks truth.  

5. Vangisa rose and praised:  
"Speak words that hurt neither self nor others—  
That is good speech.  

Speak sweetly, harming none—  
That is beautiful speech.  

Truth is the sweetest nectar,  
Ancient and righteous.  
The Buddha’s words lead to peace,  
Ending all suffering."  

6. Sixth: Sariputta

1. At Savatthi, Sariputta taught the monks with clear, kind words, elucidating the Dhamma.  

2. Vangisa, inspired, praised him:  
"O wise Sariputta,  
Deep in understanding,  
Skilled in teaching the path—  
Your voice, like the cuckoo’s,  
Flows pure and sweet.  

Honey-like, delightful,  
Your words uplift the heart.  
Attentively the monks listen,  
Rejoicing in your speech."  

7. Seventh: Pavarana

1. The Buddha dwelled with 500 arahants at Savatthi. On the Pavarana day, he asked: "Do you fault me in conduct or speech?"  

2. Sariputta replied: "None, Lord. You revealed the path unknown. Your disciples follow rightly."  

3. The Buddha confirmed Sariputta’s purity and praised the assembly: "Among these 500, sixty are triple-knowledge bearers, sixty are sixfold abhinna masters, sixty are liberated both ways, the rest wisdom-liberated."  

4. Vangisa extolled:  
"On this pure full moon night,  
Five hundred arahants gather—  
Free from bonds, no more rebirth.  

Like a wheel-turning king with retinue,  
The Victor’s disciples shine.  
Having plucked desire’s arrows,  
They revere the Sun-born Sage!"  

8. Eighth: Over a Thousand

1. The Buddha taught over a thousand monks. Vangisa praised:  
"Over a thousand monks, dust-free,  
Honor the Tathagata—  
His Dhamma leads to Nirvana.  

The All-Seeing One, seventh sage,  
Rains Dhamma, quenching disciples.  
I, Vangisa, bow at the feet  
Of the Great Hero, my Teacher!"  

9. Ninth: Kondanna

1. At Rajagaha, Ven. Kondanna prostrated before the Buddha, declaring himself.  

2. Vangisa praised:  
"Elder Kondanna, first disciple,  
Master of three knowledges,  
Skilled in others’ minds—  
He bows at the Teacher’s feet!"  

10. Tenth: Maha Moggallana

1. At Rajagaha, Maha Moggallana read the minds of 500 arahants.  

2. Vangisa praised:  
"Maha Moggallana, great in power,  
Knows minds liberated without residue.  
Having crossed suffering’s flood,  
He honors the Tathagata!"  

11. Eleventh: Gaggara Lake

1. At Campa, by Gaggara Lake, the Buddha outshone thousands.  

2. Vangisa praised:  
"Like the moon in cloudless sky,  
The Sage’s glory lights the world—  
None surpasses the Enlightened One!"  

12. Twelfth: Vangisa

1. At Savatthi, Vangisa, newly an arahant, rejoiced:  
"Once I wandered composing verses,  
Till I met the Buddha and took faith.  

He taught aggregates, elements, sense-bases;  
Hearing this, I left home.  

Now, seeing the Noble Path realized,  
I attained the three knowledges—  
Celestial eye, remembrance of past lives,  
Mind-reading mastery.  

Thus completes the Vangisa Thera Samyutta with twelve suttas:  
Renunciation, Discontent, Disdaining Gentle Ones, Ananda, Well-Spoken, Sariputta, Pavarana, Over a Thousand, Kondanna, Maha Moggallana, Gaggara Lake, and Vangisa.
