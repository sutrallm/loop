2. The Demon Chapter  

1.2.1 First: The Rock  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, on Vulture Peak Mountain.  
2. At that time, the Blessed One was sitting in the open during a dark night, while a drizzling rain fell.  
3. Then Māra the Evil One, wishing to cause terror, his hair standing on end, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he shattered a large rock near the Blessed One.  
4. Then the Blessed One, knowing it was Māra the Evil One, addressed him in verse:  
"Even if Vulture Peak quakes, shaking all,  
The Buddha, liberated, does not tremble even slightly."  
5. Then Māra the Evil One, suffering and thinking, "The Blessed One knows me! The Fortunate One knows me!" withered away and vanished on the spot.  

1.2.2 Second: The Lion  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There, the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma surrounded by a large assembly.  
2. Then Māra the Evil One thought: "The ascetic Gotama is teaching the Dhamma surrounded by a large assembly. Let me confuse their eyes and approach him."  
3. Then Māra approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:  
"Do you dare roar like a lion  
Fearless before any assembly?  
Here is your match, a warrior—  
Do you think you’ve triumphed?"  
4. [The Blessed One:] "The Hero rejoices in assemblies,  
Fearless through non-attachment.  
The Tathāgata, endowed with the Ten Powers,  
Has transcended all worldly ties."  
5. Then Māra the Evil One... withered away and vanished.  

1.2.3 Third: The Rock Splinter  

1. Thus I have heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Maddakucchi Deer Park in Rājagaha.  
2. Then the Blessed One’s foot was injured by a stone splinter. The Blessed One endured sharp, severe, acute pains with mindfulness and clear comprehension.  
3. Then Māra approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:  
"Lazy, do you lie asleep?  
Or lost in composing verses?  
Having little to do, alone in the wilderness—  
For what reason do you sleep?"  
4. [The Blessed One:] "I lie not from laziness,  
Nor from composing verses.  
Having completed all tasks, free from sorrow,  
Alone in the wilderness, I lie out of compassion.  
Though pierced through the heart,  
My mind is undisturbed.  
No wound afflicts me—  
Why should I not sleep?  
Awake without hesitation,  
Eyes free from fear,  
Night and day without regret—  
Seeing the world’s impermanence,  
I lie in compassion for all beings."  
5. Then Māra... vanished.  

1.2.4 Fourth: Inappropriate  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans in a Brahmin village named Khānumata. There, he taught householders surrounded by a large crowd.  
2. Māra thought: "The ascetic Gotama is teaching householders. Let me confuse their eyes and approach him."  
3. Then Māra approached and addressed him in verse:  
"Teaching others is unfit for you!  
If you do this, you’ll be bound  
By greed and hate, entangled."  
4. [The Blessed One:] "Out of compassion and welfare,  
The Buddha teaches others.  
The Tathāgata is fully freed—  
From greed and hate, he’s liberated."  
5. Then Māra... vanished.  

1.2.5 Fifth: The Mind  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī...  
2. Then Māra approached and addressed him in verse:  
"Mind races through the sky,  
Tethered by bonds—  
You’re bound, ascetic!  
You haven’t escaped me!"  
3. [The Blessed One:] "Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, touches—  
These five sensual pleasures I reject.  
You’re defeated, Māra—  
The victor is here!"  
4. Then Māra... vanished.  

1.2.6 Sixth: The Bowl  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was teaching the five aggregates of clinging to monks, who listened attentively.  
2. Māra thought: "I will confuse them."  
3. Many alms bowls were laid out in the open to dry.  
4. Māra assumed the form of a bull and approached the bowls.  
5. A monk warned another: "Brother! That bull might break the bowls!"  
6. The Blessed One said: "That is no bull—it is Māra."  
7. Then he addressed Māra in verse:  
"Form, feeling, perception, volition, consciousness—  
Not self, not mine.  
Released from passion,  
The mind is at peace,  
Beyond all bonds.  
How can you find one who’s freed?  
Your armies search in vain."  
8. Māra... vanished.  

1.2.7 Seventh: The Sphere  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the Great Wood.  
2. He taught the six sense bases to monks, who listened intently.  
3. Māra approached and caused a terrifying sound like earth splitting.  
4. A monk cried: "The earth is breaking!"  
5. The Blessed One said: "It is Māra."  
6. He addressed Māra in verse:  
"Sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches—  
These are the world’s baits,  
Ensnaring beings.  
Disciples, mindful,  
Transcend these terrors,  
Crossing Māra’s realm,  
Shining like the sun."  
7. Māra... vanished.  

1.2.8 Eighth: The Rice Ball  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Magadha at Pañcasālā.  
2. A festival was held where youths exchanged gifts.  
3. The Blessed One entered the village for alms.  
4. Māra possessed the villagers: "Give no alms to the ascetic!"  
5. The Blessed One left with an empty bowl.  
6. Māra asked: "Did you get food?"  
7. "Was it your doing, Māra?"  
8. "Then enter again. If you get food, it’s my doing!"  
[The Blessed One:] "Even if I gain nothing,  
I dwell in joy, like the Radiant Gods.  
Compassion is my sustenance."  
9. Māra... vanished.  

1.2.9 Ninth: The Farmer  

1. At Sāvatthī, the Blessed One taught about Nibbāna.  
2. Māra thought to confuse the monks.  
3. He took the form of a farmer, approached, and asked:  
"Have you seen my oxen?"  
4. [The Blessed One:] "What have oxen to do with you?"  
5. Māra claimed ownership of the senses and their objects.  
6. [The Blessed One:] "Where no eye, form, or eye-consciousness exists—  
That is no domain of yours."  
7. ... (continued similarly for other senses)  
12–13. [Māra:] "If you claim ‘This is mine,’ you’re bound!"  
[The Blessed One:] "Not claiming ‘mine,’ I’m free.  
You don’t see my path."  
14. Māra... vanished.  

1.2.10 Tenth: Rule  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the Himalayas.  
2. He pondered: "Can I rule without harm?"  
3. Māra appeared and said: "Rule rightly, without killing!"  
4. [The Blessed One:] "Why say this?"  
5. Māra urged him to turn the Himalayas to gold.  
6. [The Blessed One:] "Even a mountain of gold  
Couldn’t satisfy one’s craving.  
Seeing suffering’s cause,  
One learns to discard desire."  
7. Māra... vanished.  

These are the verses:  
Rock, Lion, Rock Splinter, Inappropriate, Mind,  
Bowl, Sphere, Rice Ball, Farmer, Rule—these ten.
