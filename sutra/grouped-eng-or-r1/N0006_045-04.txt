4. The Division on Practice  

[31] 1. Action  

1-2. At Savatthi.  

3. "Bhikkhus, I will teach you wrong practice and right practice. Listen closely.  

Bhikkhus, what is wrong practice? Wrong view, [wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness,] wrong concentration. Bhikkhus, this is called wrong practice.  

4. Bhikkhus, what is right practice? Right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. Bhikkhus, this is called right practice."  

[32] 2. The Practitioner  

1-2. At Savatthi...  

3. "Bhikkhus, I will teach you the wrong practitioner and the right practitioner. Listen closely.  

Bhikkhus, what is the wrong practitioner? Here, someone possesses wrong view, [wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness,] wrong concentration. Bhikkhus, this is called the wrong practitioner.  

4. Bhikkhus, what is the right practitioner? Here, someone possesses right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. Bhikkhus, this is called the right practitioner."  

[33] 3. Loss  

1-2. At Savatthi...  

3. "Bhikkhus, if one loses the Noble Eightfold Path, they lose the true path leading to the cessation of suffering. If one cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path, they cultivate the true path leading to the cessation of suffering.  

4. Bhikkhus, what is the Noble Eightfold Path? It is right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. Bhikkhus, losing this path means losing the path to the cessation of suffering. Cultivating this path means cultivating the path to the cessation of suffering."  

[34] 4. Crossing the Flood  

1-2. At Savatthi...  

3. "Bhikkhus, cultivating and frequently practicing eight qualities leads from this shore to the far shore. What eight? Right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. Cultivating these eight leads beyond.  

4. The Blessed One then added:  
(1) "Few among humans reach the far shore; the rest only run along this bank.  
(2) Those who practice the true Dhamma cross beyond death's realm, hard to transcend.  
(3) The wise abandon dark deeds, cultivate brightness, leave home for the homeless life, seeking joy in solitude.  
(4) They desire delight, renounce sensual pleasures, purify their minds of defilements.  
(5) With wisdom perfected, free from clinging, effluence destroyed, they attain Nirvana here and now.""  

[35–40] 5–10. The Ascetic’s Duty (1–2), The Brahmin’s Duty (1–2), The Holy Life (1–2)  

(Each section follows the same structure, defining "ascetic/Brahmin/holy practice" as the Eightfold Path and their "fruit/goal" as the destruction of greed, hatred, and delusion or the four stages of enlightenment.)  

... (Remaining suttas [41–138] follow analogous patterns, reiterating the Eightfold Path's role in overcoming defilements, achieving liberation, and crossing to Nirvana, with repeated emphasis on cultivating each factor through detachment, renunciation, and diligent practice.)  

Final Summary Verses:  
This division's themes:  
Action, practitioner, loss, crossing,  
Two on ascetic duties, two on Brahmin's,  
Two on the holy life—thus concludes this division.  

(The remaining sections expand on supporting factors like good friendship, virtue, effort, and mindfulness as prerequisites for the Eightfold Path, using similes of rivers flowing to the ocean to illustrate progress toward Nirvana.)
