7. Sariputta Sanyutta  

1. Separation  

1. At that time, Venerable Sariputta was dwelling in Savatthi, at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.  

2. Then, Venerable Sariputta, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and entered Savatthi for alms.  

3. After wandering for alms in Savatthi, he returned from the alms round, went to the Andha Grove, and sat down for the day’s abiding.  

4. Having entered the Andha Grove, he sat at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.  

5. Then, Venerable Sariputta arose from seclusion in the late afternoon and went to Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.  

6. Venerable Ananda saw Venerable Sariputta coming from afar and said to him: "Friend Sariputta, your senses are clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. Under what dwelling did Venerable Sariputta abide today?"  

7. "Friend, here I dwelled having secluded myself from sensual desires, secluded from unwholesome states, entered and abided in the first jhana, accompanied by initial and sustained thought, with joy and pleasure born of seclusion. Friend, at that time, I considered: 'I enter the first jhana; I have entered the first jhana; I do not emerge from the first jhana.'"  

8. Because Venerable Sariputta had long ago fully abandoned the conceit of 'I,' the conceit of 'mine,' and the latent tendencies of pride, he considered: "I enter the first jhana; I have entered the first jhana; I do not emerge from the first jhana."  

2. Without Initial Thought  

1–5. [At that time, Venerable Sariputta] Savatthi... [as above].  

6. Venerable Ananda saw Venerable Sariputta coming from afar and said to him: "Friend Sariputta... Under what dwelling did Venerable Sariputta abide today?"  

7. "Friend, here, with the subsiding of initial and sustained thought, I entered and abided in the second jhana, with inner clarity and one-pointedness of mind, free from initial and sustained thought, accompanied by joy and pleasure born of concentration. Friend... I do not emerge from the second jhana."  

8. Venerable Sariputta, having long abandoned [the conceits]... considered: "I enter the second jhana... I do not emerge from the second jhana."  

3. Joy  

1–6. [Savatthi...]  

Venerable Ananda... said: "Friend Sariputta... Under what dwelling did you abide today?"  

7–8. "Friend, here, with the fading of joy, I dwelled in equanimity, mindful and fully aware, experiencing pleasure through the body, abiding in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare: ‘He dwells pleasantly, mindful, and equanimous’... [as before]."  

4. Equanimity  

1–6. [Savatthi...]  

"Friend... Under what dwelling?"  

7–8. "Friend, here, having abandoned pleasure and pain, and having previously ended joy and sorrow, I entered and abided in the fourth jhana, which is neither painful nor pleasant, purified by equanimity and mindfulness... [as before]."  

5. Space  

1–6. [Savatthi...]  

7–8. "Friend, here, by transcending all perceptions of form, ending perceptions of resistance, and disregarding diverse perceptions, thinking ‘space is infinite,’ I entered and abided in the base of infinite space... [as before]."  

6. Consciousness  

1–6. [Savatthi...]  

7–8. "Friend, by transcending infinite space, thinking ‘consciousness is infinite,’ I entered and abided in the base of infinite consciousness... [as before]."  

7. Nothingness  

1–6. [Savatthi...]  

7–8. "Friend, by transcending infinite consciousness, I entered and abided in the base of nothingness... [as before]."  

8. Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception  

1–6. [Savatthi...]  

7–8. "Friend, by transcending the base of nothingness, I entered and abided in the base of neither perception nor non-perception... [as before]."  

9. Cessation  

1–6. [Savatthi...]  

7. "Friend, by transcending the base of neither perception nor non-perception, I entered and abided in the cessation of perception and feeling. Friend... I do not emerge from it."  

8. Venerable Sariputta... considered: "[I enter] the cessation... I do not emerge..."  

10. Pure Mouth  

1. At that time, Venerable Sariputta was dwelling in Rajagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.  

2. Then, Venerable Sariputta, dressed in the morning... went for alms in Rajagaha. After wandering for alms, he leaned against a wall to eat the offered food.  

3. Then the nun named Sundarī approached Venerable Sariputta and said:  

4. "Ascetic, do you eat with your mouth turned downward?"  

"Sister, I do not eat so."  

5. "Ascetic, then do you eat with your mouth turned upward?"  

"Sister, I do not eat so."  

6. "Do you eat with your mouth turned to the four directions?"  

"No."  

7. "To the four intermediates?"  

"No."  

8. "When asked about mouth turned downward, you deny it... How then do you eat?"  

9. "Sister, ascetics or brahmins who live by wrong livelihood through crafty arts, animal-training, etc., eat with mouths turned downward.  

10. Those who live by astrology, animal-training... eat mouths upward.  

11. Those who act as messengers or envoys... eat mouths turned to the four directions.  

12. Those who live by divination... eat mouths to the four intermediates.  

13. I do not live by such wrong livelihoods. I eat food righteously acquired through the Dharma."  

14. Then Sundarī went to Rajagaha’s streets and proclaimed: "The Sakyan ascetics eat lawfully! Give alms to them blamelessly!"
