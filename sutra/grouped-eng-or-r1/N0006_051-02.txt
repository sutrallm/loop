2. The Chapter on the Shaking of Migāramātā's Mansion  

1. Sāvatthī.  

2. "Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta not yet fully enlightened, this thought arose in me: 'What is the cause, what is the condition, for cultivating the bases of psychic power?'  

3. 'Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis of psychic power accompanied by concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving. He neither overstrains nor slackens regarding desire. He does not inwardly restrain or outwardly scatter. He dwells perceiving before and after: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below. As by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. Thus, with a mind open and unenveloped, he cultivates a luminous mind.  

4. He develops the basis of psychic power accompanied by concentration due to energy and volitional formations of striving...  

5. He develops the basis of psychic power accompanied by concentration due to mind and volitional formations of striving...  

6. He develops the basis of psychic power accompanied by concentration due to investigation and volitional formations of striving. He neither overstrains nor slackens regarding investigation. He does not inwardly restrain or outwardly scatter. He dwells perceiving before and after... Thus, with a mind open and unenveloped, he cultivates a luminous mind.'  

7. Bhikkhus, when these four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated, a bhikkhu wields the various kinds of psychic power: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as through space; he dives into the earth and emerges as if in water; he walks on water without sinking as if on land; he travels cross-legged through the sky like a bird; he touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; he exercises mastery over the body even up to the Brahma world.  

8. When these four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated, a bhikkhu hears with the divine ear, purified and surpassing the human, both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether far or near.  

9. When these four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated, a bhikkhu understands the minds of other beings, encompassing them with his own mind: a mind affected by lust as affected by lust; a mind free from lust as free from lust... a liberated mind as liberated.  

10. When these four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated, a bhikkhu recollects his manifold past lives... He recollects his various past lives with features and details.  

11. When these four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated, a bhikkhu sees beings passing away and being reborn... and understands how beings fare according to their kamma.  

12. When these four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated, a bhikkhu realizes the destruction of the taints, and having realized it for himself with direct knowledge, he here and now enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom."  

3. The Second: Great Fruit  

2. "Bhikkhus, for one who develops and cultivates these four bases of psychic power, great fruit and great benefit accrue.  

3-6. (Repeats development of the four bases as in 2:3-6)  

7-12. (Repeats the attainments as in 2:7-12)"  

4. The Third: Desire  

2. "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu cultivates concentration due to desire accompanied by volitional formations of striving, this is called the basis of psychic power. He arouses desire, strives, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and struggles to prevent unarisen unwholesome states...  

3. When he cultivates concentration due to energy...  

4. When he cultivates concentration due to mind...  

5. When he cultivates concentration due to investigation..."  

5. The Fourth: Moggallāna  

1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Eastern Park.  

2-6. (Account of the Buddha instructing Mahāmoggallāna to shake the mansion to discipline negligent monks, followed by the Buddha's explanation that Moggallāna's powers came from cultivating the four bases of psychic power)  

6. The Fifth: The Brahmin  

1-10. (Dialogue between Ānanda and a brahmin on abandoning desire through the four bases of psychic power)  

7. The Sixth: Ascetics and Brahmins (1)  

2-6. "All past, future, and present ascetics and brahmins possessing great psychic power did so by cultivating these four bases..."  

8. The Seventh: Ascetics and Brahmins (2)  

2-6. (Same framework applied specifically to psychic attainments)  

9. The Eighth: The Monk  

2-3. "A monk cultivating these four bases realizes the destruction of the taints..."  

10. The Ninth: Exposition  

2-6. Defines psychic power (iddhi), bases of power (iddhipāda), their development, and the Noble Eightfold Path as the way.  

11. The Tenth: Analysis  

2-38. Detailed analysis of balanced effort in cultivating each base of power, avoiding extremes of slackness or strain, and maintaining luminous awareness.
