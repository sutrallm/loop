1. [1. The King] 1-2 At Savatthi. 3 "Monks, a wheel-turning monarch who rules over the four continents, upon the breakup of the body after death, is reborn in a good destination, the heavenly world. There among the Tavatimsa devas, surrounded by celestial nymphs in the Garden of Delight, he dwells enjoying the fivefold heavenly sensual pleasures. Yet he cannot escape four things: he cannot escape being reborn in hell, escape being reborn in the animal realm, escape being reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts, or escape bad rebirths, evil destinations, the lower worlds. 4 But a noble disciple who lives on almsfood and wears rough robes, endowed with four factors, escapes hell, escapes the animal realm, escapes the realm of hungry ghosts, escapes bad rebirths, evil destinations, the lower worlds. What four? 5 Here, monks, a noble disciple possesses confirmed faith in the Buddha: 'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' 6 He possesses confirmed faith in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.' 7 He possesses confirmed faith in the Sangha: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way. These four pairs of persons, the eight kinds of individuals, are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation; the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.' 8 And he possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones—unbroken, flawless, unblemished, untainted, liberating, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. 9 These are the four factors. 10 Monks, between gaining mastery over the four continents and gaining these four factors, the latter is better by a sixteenth part."

2. [2. The Stream-Enterer] 3 "Monks, a noble disciple endowed with four factors is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination. What four? 4 Here, monks, a noble disciple possesses confirmed faith in the Buddha... 5-6 ...in the Dhamma... ...in the Sangha... 7 ...and possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones... 8 When a noble disciple is endowed with these four factors, he is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination." 9 Thus spoke the Blessed One. The Teacher then added: "One with faith and virtue, endowed with confidence, contemplating the Dhamma in proper order—they will reach the end of suffering after completing the holy life."

3. [3. Long Life] 1 Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove. 2 At that time, the lay disciple Long Life was afflicted, suffering from a serious illness. 3 Long Life then said to his father, the householder Tuvataka: "Go to the Blessed One, pay homage at his feet, and say: 'Venerable sir, Long Life is gravely ill. He pays homage at your feet.' Then plead: 'May the Blessed One visit Long Life out of compassion.'" 4 "Yes, son," replied Tuvataka. He approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and conveyed the message. The Blessed One consented silently. 5 Arriving at Long Life's house, the Blessed One asked: "Are you enduring, Long Life? Are your pains decreasing?" 6 "Venerable sir, the pains are unbearable, increasing not decreasing." 7 "Then train thus: 'I possess confirmed faith in the Buddha... Dhamma... Sangha... and the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones...'" 8 "But sir, these four factors of stream-entry are already perfected in me!" 8 "Then Long Life, based on these four factors, develop six things leading to enlightenment: contemplate all formations as impermanent, suffering as pain, phenomena as non-self; cultivate dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment." 9 "Sir, these six factors are also perfected in me. But I worry about my father's sorrow after my death." 10 Tuvataka said: "Don't think that, son! Follow the Blessed One's words." 12 After the Blessed One left, Long Life passed away. 12 The monks inquired about his rebirth. 13 "Long Life was wise. Having destroyed the five lower fetters, he was reborn spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and will attain final Nibbana there."

4. [4. Sariputta (1)] 1 At Savatthi, Venerables Sariputta and Ananda. 2 Ananda asked: "What four factors make one a stream-enterer?" 3 Sariputta replied: "Confirmed faith in Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, and virtuous behavior leading to concentration."

5. [5. Sariputta (2)] 2 The Buddha asked Sariputta: "What are the stream-entry factors?" 3 Sariputta: "Associating with the virtuous, hearing the true Dhamma, careful attention, practicing in accordance with Dhamma." 4 The Buddha approved. 4 Asked about 'stream,' Sariputta replied: "The Noble Eightfold Path." 5 Asked about 'stream-enterer,' Sariputta said: "One accomplished in this path."

6. [6. The Artisan] 1 At Savatthi. 2 Monks prepared robes for the Buddha's journey. 3 Artisans Isidatta and Purana heard and sent a lookout. 5-6 Meeting the Buddha, they expressed sorrow when he traveled afar and joy when near. 18 The Buddha taught worldly life as crowded, monastic life as peaceful. 23 Stream-entry factors: faith in Triple Gem and generosity. 26 The Buddha confirmed their generosity surpassed others'.

7. [7. Bhadra] 1 At Bhadra village. 2 The villagers approached the Buddha seeking heavenly rebirth. 5 Teaching self-benefit through ethical conduct: 6-12 Abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter. 13-16 Cultivating faith in Triple Gem and pure virtue. 17 Mastering these seven, one attains stream-entry. 18 The villagers took refuge.

8. [8. The Brick Hall (1)] 2 Ananda asked about deceased monks' destinations. 3-4 The Buddha explained: monks attaining arahantship, nuns non-returning, lay followers once-returning or stream-entry. 5-7 Introduced Dhamma Mirror: four factors of stream-entry.

9. [9. The Brick Hall (2)] 2-7 Similar queries about deceased followers named Asoka. Same teaching on Dhamma Mirror repeated.

10. [10. The Brick Hall (3)] 2-7 Over 500 lay followers' rebirths: many non-returners, once-returners, stream-enterers. Emphasis on Dhamma Mirror teaching.
