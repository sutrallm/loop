4. The Heavenly Host of Satullapa

31. First: Association with the Good

1. Thus have I heard. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi, in the Jeta Grove, Anathapindika's Park.

2. At that time, many Satullapa deities, illuminating the entire Jeta Grove with their surpassing radiance, approached the Blessed One in the early dawn. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.

3. A deity standing to one side spoke this verse before the Blessed One:

Only with the good should one associate;  
Only with the good should one converse.  
By knowing the true Dhamma of the good,  
One becomes better, not worse.

4. Then another deity spoke this verse before the Blessed One:

Only with the good should one associate;  
Only with the good should one converse.  
By knowing the true Dhamma of the good,  
One gains wisdom not otherwise obtained.

5. Then another deity spoke this verse before the Blessed One:

Only with the good should one associate;  
Only with the good should one converse.  
By knowing the true Dhamma of the good,  
In sorrow, sorrow is not found.

6. Then another deity spoke this verse before the Blessed One:

Only with the good should one associate;  
Only with the good should one converse.  
By knowing the true Dhamma of the good,  
One shines forth among one’s kin.

7. Then another deity spoke this verse before the Blessed One:

Only with the good should one associate;  
Only with the good should one converse.  
By knowing the true Dhamma of the good,  
Beings fare on to a good destination.

8. Then another deity spoke this verse before the Blessed One:

Only with the good should one associate;  
Only with the good should one converse.  
By knowing the true Dhamma of the good,  
All beings dwell in happiness.

9. Then the deities asked the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, which verse was well-spoken?" The Blessed One replied: "All your verses were well-spoken in their own way. But listen to mine:

Only with the good should one associate;  
Only with the good should one converse.  
By knowing the true Dhamma of the good,  
One is entirely freed from all suffering."

32. Second: Stinginess

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...

2. Many Satullapa deities... approached the Blessed One in the early dawn...

3. A deity spoke this verse before the Blessed One:

Through stinginess and negligence,  
They do not give.  
But having understood the fruit of giving,  
The wise, desiring merit, should give generously.

4. Another deity spoke:

Stingy, fearing loss, they do not give.  
The terror of stinginess is hunger and thirst.  
Though fools crave in this life and the next,  
They fall prey to these same fears.  
Therefore, abandon stinginess,  
Conquer this defilement.  
Those who practice charity  
Cross to safety in the next world.

5. Another deity spoke:

Tossing gleanings to the needy,  
Sustaining family with meager means—  
Even such poor giving  
Is a thousand-fold meritorious.  
But lavish sacrificial offerings  
Cannot match a sixteenth part  
Of righteous charity.

6. Another deity spoke:

What one gives unwillingly,  
Or with impure intent,  
Though a thousand sacrifices—  
Even a hundred thousand—  
Cannot rival a sixteenth part  
Of properly bestowed alms.

7. The deities asked: "Which verse was well-spoken?" The Blessed One replied: "All spoke well. Hear my verse:

Though gleaning scraps to feed one’s wife,  
A poor man’s proper gift  
Outshines a thousand sacrifices.  
Why? His gift springs from virtue,  
Given with steadfast faith."

8. A deity questioned:

Why do grand sacrifices fail  
To match pure charity?  
What makes these ritual rites  
Not worth a sixteenth part?

9. The Blessed One answered:

Sacrifices tainted by cruelty,  
Where herds are slaughtered in distress,  
Such acts—tear-stained and violent—  
Cannot compare to righteous gifts.  
Thus, a poor man’s proper offering  
Exceeds a thousand blood-stained rites.

33. Third: Well-Spoken

1. [The Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi...]

2. The Satullapa deities... approached...

3. A deity spoke:

Excellent is giving!  
Stinginess and laziness fail;  
The wise, knowing reward,  
Practice charity for merit.

4. Another deity:

Excellent is giving!  
Even the poor who give  
Gain merit a thousand-fold—  
While the rich who hoard  
Accumulate no virtue.

5. Another deity:

Excellent is giving!  
Even poor donors prosper.  
Though few give, the wise surpass the many.  
Faith-based charity brings peace.

6. Another deity:

Excellent is giving!  
The faithful, righteous giver,  
Striving diligently,  
Crosses the Yamunā river,  
Reaching heavenly realms.

7. Another deity:

Excellent is giving!  
Discerning alms exceed mere offerings.  
The Buddhas praise such gifts—  
Like seeds in fertile soil,  
They yield abundant fruit.

8. Another deity:

Excellent is giving!  
Harmlessness toward beings,  
Restraint, and blameless livelihood—  
These virtues, praiseworthy here,  
Lead beyond all suffering.

9. Asked which verse was best, the Blessed One said: "All spoke well. Hear my truth:

Gifts given with faith earn praise;  
But Dhamma practice leads beyond.  
Ancient sages, fully awakened,  
Found peace through such wisdom."

34. Fourth: Not Thus

1. The Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi...

2. Many Satullapa deities... approached...

3. A deity spoke:

People crave sensual pleasures,  
Yet these are impermanent.  
Bound by delight,  
They sink in carelessness,  
Falling under Death’s rule.  
From craving springs sorrow,  
From craving, bondage.  
Tame desire, and sorrow fades.  
Objects aren’t the snare—  
Clinging to them imprisons.  
The wise, unshackled,  
Abandon anger and pride,  
Not grasping name-and-form.  
No pain can touch them:  
Desire uprooted,  
No thirst remains;  
All fetters split,  
They cross beyond.

4. Venerable Moggallāna asked:

If in this world or the next,  
No liberated ones are found—  
Whom should we revere,  
Honoring ultimate good?

5. The Blessed One replied:

Monks who venerate the free,  
Who know Dhamma, doubt-dispelled—  
They too transcend bonds.  
Praise such noble ones.

35. Fifth: The Accusing Deities

1. The Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi...

2. Many accusing deities... confronted the Blessed One...

3. One deity sneered:

Pretending virtues you lack,  
Like a gambler’s deceit—  
Your stolen gains won’t last.  
Though you preach, your acts reveal naught.

4. The Blessed One replied:

Knowledge without practice  
Lacks foundation.  
The wise cultivate truth,  
Breaking Mara’s chains.  
Through insight, they reach peace—  
Not mere words, but freedom.

5. Humbled, the deities begged pardon. But Buddha smiled—they raged.  
Another deity taunted:

Though we confessed, your silence condemns.  
Are the pure not merciful?  
Who lacks fault? All err.  
Only Buddhas stand flawless.  
Your grudges chain you still...

36. Sixth: Faith

1. The Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi...

2. Satullapa deities approached...

3. A deity praised:

Faithful, virtuous ones gain renown,  
Born in heaven after death.  
Abandon pride and hate,  
Sever all bonds.  
Not clinging to name-and-form—  
Such wise ones wander free.  
Guard heedfulness as treasure.  
Avoid laxity and lust—  
Through heedful meditation,  
Supreme joy is attained.

37. Seventh: The Gathering

1. At Kapilavatthu’s Great Wood,  
The Buddha dwelled with 500 monks.  
Devas from ten realms gathered.

2. Four Pure Abode deities resolved to join,  
Appearing instantly.

3. Verses were exchanged:

"A mighty crowd assembles here—  
Gods and humans meet the faultless Sangha.  
We come to witness this Dhamma gathering."

"The monks restrain their senses,  
Like charioteers steering steeds."

"Shattering bonds, uprooting greed,  
The clear-eyed wander undefiled."

"Those who revere the Buddha  
Escape woeful realms.  
Leaving the body, they fill heavens."

38. Eighth: The Stone Splinter

1. At Maddakucchi deer park,  
The Buddha’s foot was injured.  
Bearing sharp pain mindfully,  
He laid down, composed.

2. Satullapa deities praised his fortitude:

"Lion-like, unmoved by agony,  
Taming adversity—  
Such is the Buddha’s might."

"Master of patience, enduring pain  
With unshaken focus—  
None can shake the Tamed One."

"The sage who quenches craving,  
Unattached, serene—  
He crosses Death’s dominion,  
Beyond all ties."

39. Ninth: Red Lotus, Cloud Deity

1. At Vesali’s Great Hall,  
Red Lotus, a cloud deity, approached:

"Homage to the Awakened One!  
Slanderers of this Dharma  
Fall to hell’s torments.  
Devotees of the peaceful path  
Replenish celestial hosts."

40. Tenth: Minor Red Lotus

1. The younger Red Lotus came,  
Echoing similar praise:

"Like lightning’s glow, I hail the Dharma.  
Abstaining from evil in deeds, words, and thoughts—  
Free from craving, mindful always,  
One escapes all suffering."
