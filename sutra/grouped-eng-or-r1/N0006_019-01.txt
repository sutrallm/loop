1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel's Feeding Place.  
2. At that time, the Venerable Lakhana and the Venerable Maha Moggallana were dwelling on Vulture Peak.  
3. Then the Venerable Maha Moggallana, having dressed in the morning and taken his bowl, approached the Venerable Lakhana.  
4. Having approached the Venerable Lakhana, he said: "Friend Lakhana, let us enter Rajagaha for alms." "Very well, friend," replied the Venerable Lakhana to the Venerable Maha Moggallana.  
5. Then the Venerable Maha Moggallana descended from Vulture Peak and smiled at a certain spot.  
6. The Venerable Lakhana then said to the Venerable Maha Moggallana: "Friend Moggallana, for what reason did you smile?" "Friend Lakhana, this question is untimely. Ask me this question in the presence of the Blessed One."  
7. Then the Venerable Lakhana and the Venerable Maha Moggallana, after wandering for alms in Rajagaha and finishing their meal, put away their bowls, approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and sat down to one side.  
8. Sitting to one side, the Venerable Lakhana said to the Venerable Maha Moggallana: "Friend Maha Moggallana, descending from Vulture Peak, you smiled at a certain spot. For what reason did you smile?"  
9. "Friend, as I descended from Vulture Peak, I saw a skeleton moving through the air. Vultures, kites, and hawks followed it, pecking at its ribs and scattering them. I saw it uttering cries of pain.  
10. Friend, I thought: 'It is astonishing, indeed unheard of, that such a being exists, such a spirit exists, that such a form of acquired individuality exists.'"  
11. Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, disciples dwell with the eye of truth. Monks, disciples dwell with true knowledge. Indeed, such disciples know, see, and realize.  
12. Monks, I too have seen that being but did not speak of it. If I had spoken, others might not believe me, leading to lasting harm and suffering for those who disbelieve.  
13. Monks, that being was a cattle-butcher in Rajagaha. Due to the ripening of his karma, for many years, hundreds and thousands of years, he fell into hell. By the residual effect of his karma, he now experiences such a form."  
This is the brief explanation of the sutta.
