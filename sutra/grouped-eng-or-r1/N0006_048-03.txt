3. The Six Roots

21. First: Future Existence  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are five faculties. What are the five faculties? They are: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom.  

3. Bhikkhus, as long as I did not truly understand the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape concerning these five faculties, I was not acknowledged in this world with its devas, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, brahmins, and beings as the one perfected in unsurpassed full awakening.  

4. But when I truly understood the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape concerning these five faculties, I was acknowledged in this world with its devas, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, brahmins, and beings as the one perfected in unsurpassed full awakening. The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My liberation is unshakable. This is my last birth. There is now no renewed existence.’"  

22. Second: Vital Faculty  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are three faculties. What are the three faculties? They are: the female faculty, the male faculty, and the vitality faculty.  

3. Bhikkhus, these are the three faculties."  

23. Third: Knowledge  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are three faculties. What are the three faculties? They are: the faculty of one who will know the unknown, the faculty of final knowledge, and the faculty of one endowed with final knowledge.  

3. Bhikkhus, these are the three faculties."  

24. Fourth: One-Seeder  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are five faculties. What are the five faculties? They are: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom.  

3. Bhikkhus, one who fulfills and perfects these five faculties is an arahant. If they are weaker than that, one is an intermediate attainert. If still weaker, one is a non-returner who passes away and attains Nibbāna without returning. If weaker, one is a non-returner who attains Nibbāna without effort. If weaker, one is a non-returner who attains Nibbāna with effort. If weaker, one is ascending to the realm of the highest gods. If weaker, one is a once-returner. If weaker, one is a one-seeder. If weaker, one passes from family to family. If weaker, one attains Nibbāna within seven lifetimes. If weaker, one is a Dhamma-follower. If weaker, one is a faith-follower."  

25. Fifth: Purification  

1. "Bhikkhus, there are six faculties. What are the six faculties? They are: the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty, and the mind faculty. Bhikkhus, these are the six faculties."  

26. Sixth: Stream-Enterer  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are six faculties. What are the six faculties? They are: the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty, and the mind faculty.  

3. Bhikkhus, when a noble disciple understands as it truly is the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape concerning these six faculties, they are called a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the lower realms, fixed in destiny, with awakening as their destination."  

27. Seventh: Arahant (1)  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are six faculties. What are the six faculties? They are: the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty, and the mind faculty.  

3. Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu understands as it truly is the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape concerning these six faculties and is liberated through non-clinging, they are called an arahant—one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained their own goal, utterly destroyed the fetter of existence, and is liberated by final knowledge."  

28. Eighth: Arahant (2)  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are six faculties. What are the six faculties? They are: the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty, and the mind faculty.  

3. Bhikkhus, as long as I did not truly understand the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape concerning these six faculties, I was not acknowledged as the one perfected in unsurpassed full awakening in this world with its devas, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, brahmins, and beings.  

4. But when I truly understood the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape concerning these six faculties, I was acknowledged as the one perfected in unsurpassed full awakening in this world with its devas, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, brahmins, and beings. The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My liberation is unshakable. This is my last birth. There is now no renewed existence.’"  

29. Ninth: Ascetics and Brahmins (1)  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are six faculties. What are the six faculties? They are: the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty, and the mind faculty.  

3. Bhikkhus, I do not recognize those ascetics or brahmins who do not truly understand the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape concerning these six faculties as true ascetics or brahmins. They do not realize the goal of asceticism or brahminhood in this very life.  

4. But I acknowledge those ascetics or brahmins who truly understand the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape concerning these six faculties as true ascetics or brahmins. They realize the goal of asceticism or brahminhood in this very life."  

30. Tenth: Ascetics and Brahmins (2)  

3. "Bhikkhus, I do not recognize those ascetics or brahmins who do not know the eye faculty, its origin, cessation, or the path leading to its cessation; who do not know the ear faculty... nose faculty... tongue faculty... body faculty... mind faculty, its origin, cessation, or the path leading to its cessation, as true ascetics or brahmins. They do not realize the goal of asceticism or brahminhood in this very life.  

4. But I acknowledge those ascetics or brahmins who know the eye faculty, its origin, cessation, and the path leading to its cessation; who know the ear faculty... nose faculty... tongue faculty... body faculty... mind faculty, its origin, cessation, and the path leading to its cessation, as true ascetics or brahmins. They realize the goal of asceticism or brahminhood in this very life."
