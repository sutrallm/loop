4. The Sinsapa Grove Chapter  

31. First – Sinsapa  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Kosambi, in the Sinsapa Grove.  

2. Then the Blessed One took a few Sinsapa leaves in his hand and addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, what do you think? Which is more: the few Sinsapa leaves I hold in my hand or those in the Sinsapa Grove above?”  
“Venerable sir, the few Sinsapa leaves the Blessed One holds are few, while those in the Sinsapa Grove above are many.”  

3. “Similarly, bhikkhus, what I have directly known but not taught to you is far more. What I have taught to you is little.  

4. Why have I not taught it? Because it is unbeneficial, unrelated to the fundamentals of the holy life, and does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, or Nibbāna. Therefore, I have not taught it.  

5. What have I taught? I have taught: ‘This is suffering’; ‘This is the origin of suffering’; ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.’  

6. Why have I taught this? Because this is beneficial, related to the fundamentals of the holy life, and leads to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and Nibbāna. Therefore, I have taught it.  

7. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”  

32. Second – Khatira  

2. “Bhikkhus, if someone were to say: ‘Without directly realizing the Noble Truth of Suffering, without directly realizing the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, without directly realizing the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, without directly realizing the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, I will make an end of suffering’—that is impossible.  

3. Just as it is impossible to carry water with a vessel made of Khatira leaves, Bola leaves, or Amala leaves, so too it is impossible to make an end of suffering without directly realizing the Four Noble Truths.  

4. But if someone were to say: ‘Having directly realized the Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, I will make an end of suffering’—that is possible.  

5. Just as it is possible to carry water with a vessel made of lotus leaves, Bola leaves, or Mallika leaves, so too it is possible to make an end of suffering by directly realizing the Four Noble Truths.”  

33. Third – The Stick  

2. “Bhikkhus, suppose a stick is tossed into the air. Sometimes it falls on its end, sometimes on its middle, sometimes on its base. Similarly, beings with ignorance and craving, wandering through samsara, pass from this world to another and back. Why? Because they have not seen the Four Noble Truths.  

3. What are the Four? The Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

4. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”  

34. Fourth – Cloth  

2. “Bhikkhus, if one’s cloth or head were on fire, what should be done?”  
“Venerable sir, one should arouse supreme desire, effort, zeal, persistence, mindfulness, and clear knowledge to extinguish it.”  

3. “Bhikkhus, set aside burning cloth or head. To realize the Four Noble Truths as they are, arouse supreme desire, effort, zeal, persistence, mindfulness, and clear knowledge.  

4. What are the Four? The Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

5. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”  

35. Fifth – A Hundred Spears  

2. “Bhikkhus, suppose a man with a lifespan of a hundred years were stabbed with a hundred spears every morning, noon, and evening. After a hundred years, he would realize the Four Noble Truths he had not realized. Bhikkhus, a wise man would accept this. Why?  

3. Because samsara is endless, with beings pierced by spears, swords, and axes since time immemorial. Yet, bhikkhus, I do not teach the realization of the Four Noble Truths as painful. I teach it as joyful.  

4. What are the Four? The Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

5. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”  

36. Sixth – Beings  

2. “Bhikkhus, suppose a man gathered all the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in Jambudīpa, bound them into bundles, and strung up large, medium, and small sea creatures. Yet countless small creatures would remain unstrung. Why?  

3. Because their bodies are minute. Similarly, beings in the lower realms are countless. One freed from such realms has right view, knowing: ‘This is suffering, this its origin, this its cessation, this the path leading to cessation.’  

4. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”  

37. Seventh – The Sun (1)  

2. “Bhikkhus, dawn is the forerunner of sunrise. Similarly, right view is the forerunner of realizing the Four Noble Truths.  

3. For one with right view, it can be expected that he will know: ‘This is suffering, this its origin, this its cessation, this the path leading to cessation.’  

4. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”  

38. Eighth – The Sun (2)  

2. “Bhikkhus, before sun and moon arise, darkness reigns: no distinction of day and night, months, fortnights, seasons, or years.  

3. But when sun and moon arise, light appears, dispelling darkness, distinguishing day and night, months, fortnights, seasons, and years.  

4. Similarly, before a Tathāgata arises, darkness reigns: no teaching of the Four Noble Truths.  

5. When a Tathāgata arises, light appears, the Four Noble Truths are taught: suffering, its origin, its cessation, the path.  

6. What are the Four? The Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

7. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”  

39. Ninth – Indra’s Pillar  

2. “Bhikkhus, ascetics or brahmins who do not know the Four Noble Truths glance at others’ faces, thinking: ‘Does this one know?’  

3. Like cotton fluff tossed by winds, such people are swayed by others’ words.  

4. But those who know the Four Noble Truths are unshaken like Indra’s pillar, firmly rooted.  

8. What are the Four? The Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

9. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”  

40. Tenth – Debater  

2. “Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who knows the Four Noble Truths remains unmoved even if debaters from all directions challenge him.  

3. Like a stone pillar sixteen cubits high—stable against storms from any direction—so is one grounded in the Four Noble Truths.  

8. What are the Four? The Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

9. Therefore, bhikkhus: ‘This is suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the origin of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made! ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’—effort should be made!”
