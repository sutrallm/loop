3. The Iron Ball Chapter  

21. The First: The Path  

1. Savatthi.  
2. "Monks, before my enlightenment, while still an unenlightened bodhisatta, I thought:  
   ‘What path, what practice cultivates the bases of spiritual power?’  
   Monks, then I considered:  
3. ‘Here, a monk develops the basis of spiritual power endowed with concentration formed by desire and volitional striving. Thus, I do not overly withdraw from desire nor overexert... up to... cultivating a radiant mind.  
4-5. (Similarly for energy concentration... mind concentration...)  
6. A monk develops the basis of spiritual power endowed with concentration formed by investigation and volitional striving. Thus, I neither overly withdraw from investigation nor overexert, neither restrain inwardly nor scatter outwardly. Dwelling with the perception of before and after—later as before, before as later, below as above, above as below, night as day, day as night—cultivates a radiant mind with clarity unconfined.’  
7. Monks, when a monk cultivates and frequently practices these four bases of spiritual power thus, he attains manifold powers: becoming one he becomes many... up to... wielding bodily mastery as far as the Brahma world.  
8. Monks, when a monk cultivates and frequently practices these four bases of spiritual power thus, through the destruction of defilements, he dwells in the liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom, realized for himself here and now.  
9. The six supernormal knowledges may also be expounded.  

22. The Second: The Iron Ball  

1. Savatthi.  
2. Then Ven. Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage, sat to one side, and said:  
3. "Venerable sir, does the Blessed One teach that one can reach the Brahma world via a mind-made body through spiritual power?"  
   "Ānanda, I teach that one can reach the Brahma world via a mind-made body through spiritual power."  
4. "Venerable sir, does the Blessed One teach that one can reach the Brahma world via this physical body composed of the four elements through spiritual power?"  
   "Ānanda, I teach that one can reach the Brahma world via this physical body through spiritual power."  
5. "It is astounding, venerable sir, how the Blessed One accomplishes the unprecedented."  
   "Ānanda, the Tathāgatas are endowed with such rare and unprecedented qualities.  
6. Ānanda, the Tathāgata at times compresses the body into the mind and the mind into the body, abiding with ease and lightness in the body. Then the Tathāgata’s body becomes light, pliant, and radiant.  
7. Just as an iron ball heated all day becomes light, pliant, and radiant, so the Tathāgata’s body... becomes light, pliant, and radiant.  
8. Then, without effort, the Tathāgata’s body rises into the air, manifesting various powers: becoming one he becomes many... up to... wielding bodily mastery as far as the Brahma world.  
9. Just as a tuft of cotton floats effortlessly on the wind, so the Tathāgata’s body rises... manifesting manifold powers."  

23. The Third: The Monk  

2. "Monks, there are four bases of spiritual power. What four?  
   A monk cultivates the basis of spiritual power through desire... energy... mind... investigation.  
   These are the four.  
3. When cultivated thus, through the destruction of defilements, he dwells in liberation here and now."  

24. The Fourth: Purity  

2. "Monks, there are four bases of spiritual power: desire... investigation. These are the four."  

25. The Fifth: Fruit (1)  

2. "Monks, there are four bases of spiritual power.  
3. When cultivated, one of two fruits follows: enlightenment in this life or non-return."  

26. The Sixth: Fruit (2)  

2. "Monks, there are four bases of spiritual power.  
3. When cultivated, seven fruits arise: enlightenment in this life... up to... rebirth in the highest heaven.  
4. If not enlightened herein, then... as an intermediate... or proceeding to the Akaniṭṭha realm.  
5. These seven fruits arise from cultivating the four bases."  

27. The Seventh: Ānanda (1)  

1. Savatthi.  
2. Ven. Ānanda asked: "What is spiritual power, its basis, cultivation, and path?"  
3. "Power is manifesting manifold transformations.  
4. Its basis is the path to attain such power.  
5. Cultivation means developing desire... investigation.  
6. The path is the Noble Eightfold Path."

9-11. Thus, the Tathāgata attained unsurpassed liberation."
