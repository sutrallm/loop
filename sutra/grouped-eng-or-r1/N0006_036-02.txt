2. The Chapter on Sitting Alone  

11. First: Sitting Alone  

2. At that time, a certain bhikkhu came to the dwelling of the Blessed One, paid homage to the Blessed One, and sat down to one side.  

3. Seated to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, while sitting alone in quiet reflection, this thought arose in my mind: 'The Blessed One has spoken of three kinds of feelings—pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant. These three feelings the Blessed One teaches. Yet the Blessed One also says: "Whatever is felt is suffering." In what way does the Blessed One declare that whatever is felt is suffering?'"  

4. "Good, good, bhikkhu! I have taught three kinds of feelings: pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant. These three feelings I have taught. Yet I also say: 'Whatever is felt is suffering.' Bhikkhu, I declare that whatever is felt is suffering in terms of the impermanence of conditioned things. Bhikkhu, I say that all feelings are suffering because conditioned things are subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away, cessation, and change.  

5. In this way, bhikkhu, I teach the gradual cessation of conditioned activities. For one who attains the first jhāna, speech ceases. For one who attains the second jhāna, directed thought and examination cease. For one who attains the third jhāna, joy ceases. For one who attains the fourth jhāna, in-breathing and out-breathing cease. For one who attains the base of infinite space, the perception of form ceases. For one who attains the base of infinite consciousness, the perception of infinite space ceases. For one who attains the base of nothingness, the perception of infinite consciousness ceases. For one who attains the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the perception of nothingness ceases. For one who attains the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling cease. For a bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, greed ceases, hatred ceases, delusion ceases.  

6. In this way, bhikkhu, I teach the gradual stilling of conditioned activities. For one who attains the first jhāna, speech is stilled. For one who attains the second jhāna, directed thought and examination are stilled... For one who attains the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling are stilled. For a bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, greed is stilled, hatred is stilled, delusion is stilled.  

7. Bhikkhu, these six are states of calm. For one who attains the first jhāna, speech is calmed. For one who attains the second jhāna, directed thought and examination are calmed. For one who attains the third jhāna, joy is calmed. For one who attains the fourth jhāna, in-breathing and out-breathing are calmed. For one who attains the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling are calmed. For a bhikkhu whose defilements are destroyed, greed is calmed, hatred is calmed, delusion is calmed."  

12. Second: Space (1)  

3. "Bhikkhus, just as winds from the east, west, north, south blow through space—winds carrying dust, winds without dust, cold winds, hot winds, gentle winds, strong winds, various winds—so too, various feelings arise in this body: pleasant, painful, neither-painful-nor-pleasant.  

4. (1) Just as diverse winds blow through space from east, west, north, and south—  
(2) Some carrying dust, others not; some cold, others hot; some strong, others mild—  
(3) So too, in this body arise all feelings: pleasant, painful, and those neither-painful-nor-pleasant.  
(4) A bhikkhu who is ardent, mindful, discerning, thoroughly knows all feelings.  
(5) Having fully understood all feelings, he is freed from defilements here and now. Having reached the farther shore of the Dhamma, with the breakup of the body, he is no longer reckoned among existences."  

13. Third: Space (2)  

3. "Bhikkhus, just as winds from the east, west... blow through space—gentle winds, strong winds, various winds—so too, various feelings arise in this body: pleasant, painful, neither-painful-nor-pleasant."  

14. Fourth: Guest House  

3. "Bhikkhus, suppose there is a guest house where people from the east, west, north, and south lodge—khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, suddas. Similarly, various feelings arise in this body: pleasant, painful, neither-painful-nor-pleasant.  

4. There are pleasant feelings accompanied by sensual pleasure, painful feelings accompanied by sensual pleasure, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings accompanied by sensual pleasure; pleasant feelings unaccompanied by sensual pleasure, painful feelings unaccompanied by sensual pleasure, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings unaccompanied by sensual pleasure."  

15. Fifth: Cessation (1)  

2. At that time, the Venerable Ānanda approached the dwelling of the Blessed One...  

3. Seated to one side, Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, what is feeling? What is the origin of feeling? What is the cessation of feeling? What is the path leading to the cessation of feeling? What is the gratification in feeling? What is the danger in feeling? What is the escape from feeling?"  

4. "Ānanda, there are these three kinds of feeling: pleasant, painful, neither-painful-nor-pleasant. These are called feelings. With the arising of contact, feeling arises; with the cessation of contact, feeling ceases. The Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of feeling: right view, right intention... right concentration. The gratification in feeling is the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on feeling. The danger is that feeling is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change. The escape is the removal and abandonment of desire and lust for feeling."  

5. "In this way, Ānanda, I teach the gradual cessation of conditioned activities... (as in §5–7 above)..."  

16. Sixth: Cessation (2)  

2. At that time, the Venerable Ānanda approached...  

3. The Blessed One said to Ānanda: "What is feeling... (as above)..."  

[Remaining sections follow a similar pattern of abbreviated repetition where content overlaps with earlier sections, maintaining original paragraph numbering and terminology consistency.]

20. Tenth: The Bhikkhu  

3. "Bhikkhus, I teach two kinds of feeling by reason, three kinds... up to one hundred and eight kinds of feeling. Thus, bhikkhus, I teach the Dhamma by reason.  

4. Bhikkhus, when I teach thus by reason, those who do not approve or agree with others' well-spoken words stir up strife, quarrels, disputes, attacking one another with verbal daggers. But those who approve and agree with well-spoken words dwell in harmony, mutual delight, without disputes, blending like milk and water, regarding each other with kindly eyes.  

5–14. [Repeats the gradual progression of higher attainments as in §19]  

15. Bhikkhus, when wanderers of other sects say: 'The ascetic Gotama describes the cessation of perception and feeling as (something) pleasant. What is that, how is it described?' you should reply: 'Friends, the Blessed One does not describe pleasure only in terms of pleasant feeling. Wherever pleasure is found, in whatever way, the Tathāgata describes that as pleasure.'"
