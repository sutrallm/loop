8. The Ganges Expanded Discourse (Abiding in Detachment)  

[71] 1. Detachment  

2. "Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges River flows toward the east, slopes toward the east, and merges into the east, so too a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the five faculties flows toward Nirvana, slopes toward Nirvana, and merges into Nirvana.  

Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the five faculties flow toward Nirvana, slope toward Nirvana, and merge into Nirvana?  

3. Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith, which leads to relinquishment, based on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation. He develops the faculty of energy... the faculty of mindfulness... the faculty of concentration... the faculty of wisdom.  

4. Bhikkhus, in this way, a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the five faculties flows toward Nirvana, slopes toward Nirvana, and merges into Nirvana."  

[72–82] 2–12  

Just as with the faculties, so too with the path.  

The summary verse states:  

Six flow eastward,  
Six flow toward the ocean.  
Thus, these twelve  
Are collectively called the Ganges Chapter.  

The expanded teaching on the Ganges should be elaborated in accordance with the faculties.
