2. The Section on Worldly Desires.  

[114] 1. The First Māra’s Snare (1)  
※2–7  
"Bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, charming, connected with sensual desire, and enticing—if a bhikkhu delights in them, welcomes them, and remains clinging to them, then, bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is called one who has entered Māra’s lair, fallen under Māra’s control. Māra’s snare is fastened around his neck, and he is bound by Māra’s bonds, conforming to the will of the Evil One... Bhikkhus, mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, charming, connected with sensual desire, and enticing—if a bhikkhu delights in them, welcomes them, and remains clinging to them, then, bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is called one who has entered Māra’s lair, fallen under Māra’s control. Māra’s snare is fastened around his neck, and he is bound by Māra’s bonds, conforming to the will of the Evil One.  

8–13  
Bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, charming, connected with sensual desire, and enticing—if a bhikkhu does not delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain clinging to them, then, bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is called one who has not entered Māra’s lair, who has not fallen under Māra’s control. He is freed from Māra’s snare, released from Māra’s bonds, and does not conform to the will of the Evil One... Mental phenomena cognizable by the mind... If a bhikkhu does not delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain clinging to them, then, bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is called one who has not entered Māra’s lair, who has not fallen under Māra’s control. He is freed from Māra’s snare, released from Māra’s bonds, and does not conform to the will of the Evil One."  

[115] 2. The Second Māra’s Snare (2)  
※2–7  
"Bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, charming, connected with sensual desire, and enticing—if a bhikkhu delights in them, welcomes them, and remains clinging to them, then, bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is bound by forms cognizable by the eye. He is called one who has entered Māra’s lair, fallen under Māra’s control, conforming to the will of the Evil One... Mental phenomena cognizable by the mind... If a bhikkhu delights in them, welcomes them, and remains clinging to them, then, bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is bound by mental phenomena cognizable by the mind. He is called one who has entered Māra’s lair, fallen under Māra’s control, conforming to the will of the Evil One.  

8–13  
Bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye... If a bhikkhu does not delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain clinging to them, then, bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is freed from forms cognizable by the eye. He is called one who has not entered Māra’s lair, who has not fallen under Māra’s control, and does not conform to the will of the Evil One... Sounds cognizable by the ear... Smells cognizable by the nose... Tastes cognizable by the tongue... Tactile objects cognizable by the body... Mental phenomena cognizable by the mind... If a bhikkhu does not delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain clinging to them, then, bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is freed from mental phenomena cognizable by the mind. He is called one who has not entered Māra’s lair, who has not fallen under Māra’s control, and does not conform to the will of the Evil One."  

[116] 3. Worldly Desires (1)  
※2  
"Bhikkhus, I do not say that the end of the world can be known, seen, or reached by traveling. Yet, bhikkhus, I also do not say that without reaching the end of the world, there is an end of suffering." Having said this, the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.  

3  
Soon after the Blessed One had left, those bhikkhus considered: "Friends, the Blessed One briefly taught this: ‘Bhikkhus, I do not say that the end of the world can be known, seen, or reached by traveling...’ Without explaining the meaning in detail, he rose and entered his dwelling. Who can explain the detailed meaning of this?"  

4  
They thought: "Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Teacher and respected by wise companions. Let us approach him."  

5  
They went to Venerable Ānanda, exchanged greetings, and said: "Friend, the Blessed One said... Can you explain the meaning?"  

6  
Ānanda replied: "Friends, it is as if a man seeking heartwood passes over the roots and trunk, thinking heartwood exists in branches and leaves. Similarly, you bypass the Blessed One and ask me. But since you ask, I will explain."  

7–13  
(Explanation parallels prior text, omitted for brevity. Key point: The "world" in Noble terms is the six sense bases. To end suffering, one must cease clinging to them.)  

[117] 4. Worldly Desires (2)  
※2–5  
The Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, I realized: ‘Past sensual desires that have ceased are like extinguished fire. If my mind inclines to present or future desires, I must guard myself diligently.’ You too should guard against past, present, and future desires. The ending of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind is the territory to be known."  

6–17  
(Same discourse structure as [116], with bhikkhus seeking Ānanda’s explanation. Key point: The six sense bases' cessation is liberation. The Buddha confirms Ānanda’s correct interpretation.)  

[118] 5. Sakka  
1  
The lord of the devas, Sakka, asked the Buddha: "Why do some beings not attain Nibbāna in this life?"  

4–17  
"The eye’s forms... If a bhikkhu delights in them, his consciousness clings and he is not liberated. If he does not delight, his consciousness is freed, and he attains Nibbāna."  

[119] 6. Pañcālacaṇḍa  
(A short account of the gandhabba Pañcālacaṇḍa visiting the Buddha, structurally similar to prior suttas.)  

[120] 7. Sāriputta  
1  
Venerable Sāriputta taught a bhikkhu: "A monk who neglects sense restraint, overeats, and lacks wakefulness cannot sustain the holy life. Guard the senses, moderate eating, and practice wakefulness."  

[121] 8. Rāhula  
1  
The Buddha taught Rāhula: "The eye, forms... mind, mental phenomena are impermanent. Seeing this, the wise become disenchanted, liberated, and know: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life fulfilled.’"  

[122] 9. Bonds  
"Bhikkhus, I will teach things prone to bondage and the bond. The six sense objects are prone to bondage; desire is the bond."  

[123] 10. Grasping  
"Bhikkhus, I will teach things prone to grasping and the grasping. The six sense objects are prone to grasping; desire is the grasping."
