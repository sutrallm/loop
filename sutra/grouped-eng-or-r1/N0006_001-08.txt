8. The Chapter on Cutting Off 71. First – Killing 1. A deity standing to one side addressed the Blessed One in verse: "Killing what brings sleep with ease? Killing what causes no grief? What single thing do you praise, O Gotama, that should be destroyed?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Killing anger brings sleep with ease. Killing anger causes no grief. The nectar-like poison of anger is praised by the noble ones when destroyed. Slaying this, one grieves not." 72. Second – Chariot 1. [Deity:] "What's the mark of a chariot? What marks fire? What's a kingdom's sign? What denotes a woman?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Banners mark chariots. Smoke marks fire. A king marks a kingdom. A husband marks a woman." 73. Third – Wealth 1. [Deity:] "What's supreme wealth here? What brings happiness when cultivated? What fruit tastes sweetest? What life is best lived?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Faith is supreme wealth. Dhamma practice brings joy. Truth's fruit tastes sweetest. Life led with wisdom reigns supreme." 74. Fourth – Rain 1. [Deity:] "What grows best? What falls best? What walks best? What speaks best?" 2. [Other deity:] "Seeds grow best. Rain falls best. Cows walk best. Sons speak best." 3. [Blessed One:] "Wisdom grows best. Ignorance falls worst. Sangha walks best. Buddha speaks best." 75. Fifth – Fear 1. [Deity:] "Many fear this world of varied paths. Tell me, wise one: How does one stand fearless?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Right speech, pure mind, harmless deeds. Dwelling in faith and gentleness with wealth shared kindly – these four make safe footing." 76. Sixth – Aging 1. [Deity:] "What ages? What stays young? What's wrong path? What blocks truth? What wastes days? What stains purity? How many chasms trap mind? We ask: how to know?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Body ages. Name stays. Lust wrong path. Greed blocks truth. Youth wastes days. Women stain purity. Six senses trap minds. Forsake sloth and indulgence. Avoid laziness, wakefulness lost." 77. Seventh – Lord 1. [Deity:] "Who rules the world? Best vessel? Sword's rust? What makes hell? What drives thieves? What’s best left? What's welcomed return?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Power rules earth. Women best vessels. Anger rusts swords. Thieves make hells. Reject thieves. Monks leave best. Monks' return brings joy." 78. Eighth – Desire 1. [Deity:] "What's hoarded unshared? What ungiven? What good to release? What evil to keep?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Hoarded wealth unshared. Wealth ungiven. Release kind words. Keep foul speech bound." 79. Ninth – Sustenance 1. [Deity:] "What wraps food? What makes home rich? What pains man? What's hardest to drop? Bird's tether – what binds men?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Faith wraps food. Virtues enrich homes. Craving brings pain. Desire's hardest to loose. Men bound like birds by craving." 80. Tenth – Radiance 1. [Deity:] "What lights the world? What stays awake? Common friend? Where's proper path? Like mother feeds child – what feeds lazy? What nurtures effort? What makes earth thrive?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Wisdom lights world. Mindfulness stays awake. Ox friend. Furrows mark path. Rain feeds both lazy and diligent. Rain nourishes earth's creatures." 81. Eleventh – Quarrelless 1. [Deity:] "Who has no conflict? Life undying? Knows all desires? Free being? Though born low, worshipped by nobles – who?" 2. [Blessed One:] "Monk quarrels not. Monk dies not. Monk knows desires. Monk ever free. Though born low, monks gain noble's respect."
