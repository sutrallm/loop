2. The Garden of Joy  

1.1 The Garden of Joy  

1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.  

2. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!” — “Venerable Sir!” replied those bhikkhus to the Blessed One. The Blessed One then said: “Bhikkhus, once there was a deva of the Thirty-Three Gods, surrounded by a retinue of celestial maidens in the Garden of Joy, indulging in the five strands of sensuality. At that time, he recited this verse:  

Enjoying the renowned Triple Thirty, the dwelling of the devas—  
Who has not seen this garden knows not such bliss.  

3. Bhikkhus, when this was said, another deva replied to that deva in verse:  

You are a fool, not knowing the Tathāgata’s words:  
All conditioned things are impermanent,  
Subject to arising and passing away.  
Having arisen, they cease;  
Their stilling is true bliss.  

1.2 Delight  

1. A deity standing to one side uttered this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:  

Having children, one delights in children;  
Having cattle, the cattle owner delights.  
Humans’ delights come from dependencies;  
Without dependency, there is no delight.  

2. [The Blessed One:] Having children, one grieves for children;  
Having cattle, the cattle owner grieves.  
Humans’ grief comes from dependencies;  
Without dependency, there is no grief.  

1.3 None Like a Son  

1. A deity standing to one side uttered this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:  

Nothing is as dear as a son;  
No wealth surpasses cattle.  
No light matches the sun;  
The ocean is the supreme lake.  

2. [The Blessed One:] Nothing is as dear as oneself;  
No wealth surpasses grain.  
No light matches wisdom;  
Rain is the supreme lake.  

1.4 The Kshatriya  

1. [Deity:] The kshatriya is chief among two-legged beings;  
The ox is supreme among four-legged beasts.  
Among wives, the noble-born is best;  
Among sons, the eldest is supreme.  

2. [The Blessed One:] The enlightened one is chief among two-legged beings;  
A steed is supreme among four-legged beasts.  
Among wives, the obedient is best;  
Among sons, the filial is supreme.  

1.5 The Great Wood’s Song  

1. [Deity:] When the bright sun blazes,  
Birds halt, their wings stilled.  
The great wood’s song fills me with terror!  

2. [The Blessed One:] When the bright sun blazes,  
Birds halt, their wings stilled.  
The great wood’s song brings joy to me!  

1.6 Sleep and Sloth  

1. [Deity:] Slumbering, yawning, slothful,  
Faces bloated from overeating—  
Such people cannot awaken  
To the Noble Path’s radiance.  

2. [The Blessed One:] Sleep, sloth, and yawning,  
Glutted, breath stifled—  
By rousing effort, these are cleansed;  
The Noble Path becomes clear.  

1.7 The Turtle  

1. [Deity:] The ascetic path is harsh for fools,  
Hard to endure, fraught with pitfalls.  
Many fail, lacking self-restraint.  
How many days can one maintain it?  
Each thought a snare; each step a trap.  

2. [The Blessed One:] Like a turtle drawing in its limbs,  
A bhikkhu restrains his mind.  
Unattached, harming none,  
Free from defilements,  
He cannot be blamed.  

1.8 Shame  

1. [Deity:] Who in this world checks evil through shame,  
Like a swift horse avoids the whip’s shadow—  
Such a person swiftly escapes suffering.  

2. [The Blessed One:] Restraining evil through shame,  
Ever mindful, practicing little,  
Reaching suffering’s end,  
He levels the uneven by stillness.  

1.9 The Hut  

1. [Deity:] Do you have a hut? Do you have a nest?  
Do you have ties? Are you free from bonds?  

2. [The Blessed One:] I have no hut, no nest.  
I have no ties; I am free from bonds.  

3. [Deity:] What is your hut? What is your nest?  
What are your ties? What binds you?  

4. [The Blessed One:] Mother is the hut; wife, the nest.  
Sons are the ties; craving, the bond.  

5. [Deity:] Excellent! No hut, no nest.  
No ties, no bonds—excellent!  

2.0 Sāmidhi  

1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Tapoda Monastery.  

2. Then, the Venerable Sāmidhi rose at dawn to bathe. After bathing in the hot springs and drying himself with a single robe, he stood there.  

3. A deity, illuminating the entire Tapoda Grove with radiant light, approached Sāmidhi, hovered in the air, and said:  

[Deity:] Ascetic, you shun pleasure,  
Striving for alms.  
Indulge instead! Do not reject present joys.  
Do not waste your youth!  

[Sāmidhi:] Time is uncertain, visible or hidden.  
Thus I shun indulgence,  
Fearing the waste of time.  

4. The deity descended and said:  

“Young ascetic, fair and youthful—  
Why abandon the prime of life’s pleasures?  
Enjoy human delights! Forsake not the present!”  

5. “Friend, I reject fleeting joys. The Blessed One teaches:  
‘Sensual pleasures are perilous, bitter,  
Filled with suffering. The Dhamma is present,  
Timeless, inviting inspection,  
Leading onward—to be realized by the wise.’”  

6. “How does the Blessed One say this?”  

7. “New to ascetic life, I cannot elaborate.  
Ask the Blessed One himself.”  

8. “The Blessed One is revered by gods.  
Our paths seldom cross. Ask him, that we may hear.”  

9. Sāmidhi agreed. He approached the Blessed One,  
Related the encounter, and requested clarification.  

10-16. [Recounting the dialogue with the deity.]  

17. The deity appeared, urging: “Ask, ascetic! I am here.”  

18. [The Blessed One:] “Those who cling to names  
Are bound by Death.  
Knowing the truth beyond names,  
They blame none.”  

19-20. [Deity requests elaboration. The Blessed One:]  
“Disputes arise from ‘superior,’ ‘equal,’ ‘inferior.’  
The steadfast, free from these,  
Cannot be ranked.”  

21-22. [Deity again requests. The Blessed One:]  
“Abandon conceit, sever craving,  
Be free from bonds.  
The desireless one leaves no trace  
In heaven or earth.”  

23. [Deity:] Now I grasp your meaning:  
“Avoid evil in body, speech, and mind.  
Unattached, mindful—thus one suffers not.”
