1. Chapter 1: The Javana Chapter. 1. This Shore. 2. "Bhikkhus, for one who cultivates and frequently practices the four bases of spiritual power, this serves to cross from this shore to the far shore. What are the four bases of spiritual power? 3. Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu cultivates the basis of spiritual power consisting of desire accompanied by concentration and volitional formations; he cultivates the basis of spiritual power consisting of energy... mind... investigation accompanied by concentration and volitional formations. Bhikkhus, for one who cultivates and frequently practices these four bases of spiritual power, this serves to cross from this shore to the far shore."  

2. 2. Loss. 2. "Bhikkhus, if one loses the four bases of spiritual power, one loses the noble path leading to the destruction of suffering. If one gains the four bases of spiritual power, one gains the noble path leading to the destruction of suffering. What are the four? 3. Here, a bhikkhu cultivates the basis of spiritual power consisting of desire... energy... mind... investigation accompanied by concentration and volitional formations. 4. Bhikkhus, losing these four, one loses the path... gaining these four, one gains the path."  

3. 3. Noble. 2. "Bhikkhus, cultivating and frequently practicing the four bases of spiritual power leads to the noble release. Practicing them leads straight to the destruction of suffering. What are the four? 3. Here, a bhikkhu cultivates desire... energy... mind... investigation. 4. Cultivating these four leads to the noble release and the destruction of suffering."  

4. 4. Disenchantment. 2. "Bhikkhus, cultivating the four bases leads to complete disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and nibbāna. What are the four? 3. Here, a bhikkhu cultivates desire... energy... mind... investigation. 4. These four lead to disenchantment... nibbāna."  

5. 5. Partial. 2. "Bhikkhus, past, future, and present ascetics and brahmins who achieved partial spiritual power cultivated these four bases. What are they? 3. Here, a bhikkhu cultivates desire... energy... mind... investigation. 4. Past... future... present ascetics and brahmins achieved partial power through these four."  

6. 6. Full. 2. "Bhikkhus, past, future, and present ascetics and brahmins who achieved full spiritual power cultivated these four bases. What are they? 3. Here, a bhikkhu cultivates desire... energy... mind... investigation. 4. Past... future... present ascetics achieved full power through these four."

Here, a bhikkhu cultivates desire... energy... mind... investigation. 4. Past... future... present bhikkhus achieved liberation through these four."  

8. 8. Buddha. 2. "Bhikkhus, there are four bases of spiritual power. What are they? 3. Here, a bhikkhu cultivates desire... energy... mind... investigation. Bhikkhus, these four are called the bases. 3. Cultivating these four, the Tathāgata is called the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."  

9. 9. Knowledge. 4. "Bhikkhus, 'This is the basis of desire...'—knowledge, vision, wisdom, illumination, and light arose in me regarding truths unheard before. 'This basis should be cultivated...'—knowledge arose. 5. Similarly for energy... 6. mind... 7. investigation. Cultivating them, knowledge arose."  

10. 10. The Stupa. 1. Thus I heard. Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the Great Wood, the Hall with the Peaked Roof. 2. In the morning, the Blessed One entered Vesālī for alms. After returning, he said to Venerable Ānanda: "Bring a sitting cloth. Let us go to the Cāpāla Stupa for the day." 3. Ānanda agreed and followed. 4. At the stupa, the Blessed One sat and said: "Ānanda, Vesālī is delightful. For one who cultivates the four bases, it is possible to remain for a lifespan or longer. The Tathāgata has cultivated these four and could remain thus." 5. Though the Blessed One hinted broadly, Ānanda—mind obscured by Māra—did not urge him to stay. 6–8. The Buddha repeated his statement thrice, but Ānanda failed to respond. 9–10. The Buddha dismissed Ānanda. 11. Māra approached and urged the Buddha to attain final nibbāna, claiming his disciples were now fully trained. 12–14. Māra listed the readiness of bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, laymen, laywomen, and the dispensation's flourishing. 15. The Buddha replied: "Do not worry, Māra. In three months, the Tathāgata will attain final nibbāna." 16. He relinquished his life-formation. The earth quaked, drums sounded. 17. The Blessed One uttered this verse: "The sage has relinquished the formation toward existence. Rejoicing inwardly, having shattered self like a shell."
