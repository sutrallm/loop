3. Kosala Chapter  

21. The Person  

1. ... At Savatthi.  

2. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One... and sat to one side. The Blessed One said to him: "Great king, there are four kinds of persons found in the world."  

3. "What are the four?" "Those seen as: from darkness to darkness, from darkness to light, from light to darkness, and from light to light."  

4. "What is one from darkness to darkness? Here, someone is born in a low family—among outcasts, hunters, bamboo workers, cartwrights, or scavengers—poor, with little food and drink, living in hardship, obtaining food and clothes with difficulty. Moreover, they are ugly, deformed, sickly: blind, crippled, lame, or paralyzed. They do not gain food, drink, clothes, vehicles, garlands, scents, perfumes, beds, dwellings, or light. They engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. After death, they reappear in a plane of misery, a bad destination, a lower realm, even in hell. Just as someone goes from darkness to darkness, from gloom to gloom; so too, such a person is said to be from darkness to darkness.  

5. What is one from darkness to light? Here, someone is born into a low family... but they engage in good conduct by body, speech, and mind. After death, they reappear in a good destination, a heavenly realm. Just as someone ascends from the ground to a carriage, from a carriage to horseback, from horseback to an elephant, and from an elephant to a palace; so too, such a person is said to be from darkness to light.  

6. What is one from light to darkness? Here, someone is born into a high family... rich, prosperous, and wealthy. They are handsome, attractive, with lotus-like complexions. They gain food, drink, clothes... yet engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. After death, they reappear in a plane of misery... Just as someone descends from a palace to an elephant, from an elephant to horseback, from horseback to a carriage, from a carriage to the ground, and from the ground into darkness; so too, such a person is said to be from light to darkness.  

7. What is one from light to light? Here, someone is born into a high family... and engages in good conduct by body, speech, and mind. After death, they reappear in a good destination... Just as someone moves from carriage to horseback, horseback to elephant, elephant to palace; so too, such a person is said to be from light to light.  

8. These are the four kinds of persons found in the world."  

9. ... The Blessed One explained further:  

"One poor, faithless, mean-minded, slanderous, with evil thoughts, wrong view, no reverence, abuses ascetics and brahmins, obstructs alms: such a one, after death, falls into dark hell—from darkness to darkness.  

One poor but faithful, generous, with lofty thoughts, calm mind, honors ascetics and brahmins, gives freely: such a one, after death, ascends to heaven—from darkness to light.  

One rich but faithless, mean-minded... obstructs alms: such a one falls into hell—from light to darkness.  

One rich, faithful, generous, calm-minded... gives freely: such a one ascends to heaven—from light to light."  

22. The Grandmother  

1. ... At Savatthi.  

2. The Blessed One asked King Pasenadi: "From where do you come, great king?"  

3. "Venerable sir, my grandmother has died at 120 years.  

4. She was dear to me. If by sacrificing elephants I could prevent her death, I would. If by horses, villages, or land... but nothing could avert it."  

5. "Great king, all beings are subject to death. None escape death."  

6. "It is astonishing! Truly, all beings die. None escape."  

7. "Just as all clay pots, baked or unbaked, eventually break—so too, all beings die. None escape."  

8. ... The Blessed One spoke further:  

"All beings die. Life ends in death. By their deeds, some go to hell, others to heaven. Let one act rightly, accumulating merit for the next life. Merit is the refuge for beings hereafter."  

23. The World  

1. ... At Savatthi.  

2. King Pasenadi asked: "Venerable sir, how many things arise in the world, leading to harm, suffering, and distress?"  

3. "Three things, great king: greed, hatred, and delusion. These arise and bring harm."  

4-5. ... The Blessed One explained:  

"Greed, hatred, and delusion—these vile states arising in the mind—harm a person, just as reeds cut their own roots."  

24. Archery  

1. ... At Savatthi.  

2. King Pasenadi asked: "Where should gifts be given?"  

3. "Give where your heart feels trust."  

4. "Where do gifts bear great fruit?"  

5. "Gifts to the virtuous yield great fruit—not to the unvirtuous. Suppose a battle arises... Would you reward a cowardly, fleeing warrior?"  

6-12. "No. Only skilled, courageous warriors deserve reward."  

13-16. "Similarly, give to those free of five hindrances (sensual desire, ill will, sloth, restlessness, doubt) and endowed with five virtues (morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, knowledge of liberation).  

17. ... The Blessed One declared:  

"Just as rain soothes the earth, a wise person’s gifts bring vast merit. Support the steadfast, patient, compassionate, and learned cherishers of truth. Such giving shines like lightning, raining blessings as the sky pours rain."  

25. Mountain Simile  

1. ... At Savatthi.  

2. The Blessed One asked: "From where do you come?"  

3. "Busy with royal duties, indulging in power and pleasures."  

4. "Suppose messengers report a crushing mountain approaching from all directions. What would you do?"  

6. "Faced with such doom, only righteous deeds matter."  

7-8. "So too, death approaches. What can you do?"  

"Only cherishing Dhamma’s path, good deeds, and merits can aid one against death."  

9-14. ... The king acknowledged that no army, wealth, or ritual can thwart death.  

15. ... The Blessed One concluded:  

"Like a mountain smashing all, death crushes everyone—kings, brahmins, lowborn alike. No army, wealth, or spell halts it. Thus, the wise practice virtue, walk rightly in body, speech, and mind. Honor the Dhamma and Sangha, act justly. Praised here, reborn in heaven."
