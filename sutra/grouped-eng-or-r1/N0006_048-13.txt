[129] 1.  

2. “Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges River...  

3. Bhikkhus, here a bhikkhu cultivates the faculty of faith to completely subdue greed, completely subdue hatred, and completely subdue delusion... cultivates the faculty of energy... the faculty of mindfulness... the faculty of concentration... the faculty of wisdom... tilts toward Nirvana, leans toward Nirvana.”

Verses Summarized:  

The six flowing east,  
The six flowing to the ocean,  
Thus twelve in total,  
Constitute the Ganges chapter.  

Through subduing desire,  
The faculties are extensively explained.
