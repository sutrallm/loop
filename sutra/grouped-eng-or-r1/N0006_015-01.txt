1. Chapter 1: Firewood and Grass  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!” Those monks replied to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir!”  

3. The Blessed One said: “Monks, samsāra is without beginning. Beings roam and wander, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, unable to discern the origin of this wandering and roaming.  

4. Monks, suppose a person were to gather all the grass, firewood, twigs, and branches in this Jambudīpa into one place. Piling them into a square measuring four finger-widths, he might say: ‘This is my mother, this is my mother’s mother.’ He would count and arrange them. Monks! Even if that person could not exhaust the counting of his mother’s mother, the grass, firewood, twigs, and branches of Jambudīpa would be entirely consumed.  

5. Why is this? Monks, samsāra is without beginning. Beings roam and wander, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, unable to discern the origin of this wandering and roaming.  

6. Monks, they have thus endured suffering, anguish, and loss over the long night, swelling the graveyard.  

7. Monks, therefore, one should become disenchanted with all formations, dispassionate toward them, and liberated from them.”  

2. Second: The Earth  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, samsāra is without beginning. Beings roam and wander, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, unable to discern the origin of this wandering and roaming.  

3. Monks, suppose a person were to form the entire earth into clay pellets the size of jujube seeds, numbering them as he places them: ‘This is my father, this is my father’s father.’ Monks! Even if that person could not exhaust the counting of his father’s father, the earth would be entirely consumed.  

4. Why is this? Monks, samsāra is without beginning. Beings roam and wander, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, unable to discern the origin of this wandering and roaming.  

5. Monks, they have thus endured suffering, anguish, and loss over the long night, swelling the graveyard.  

6. Monks, therefore, one should become disenchanted with all formations, dispassionate toward them, and liberated from them.”  

3. Third: Tears  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, samsāra is without beginning. Beings roam and wander, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, unable to discern the origin of this wandering and roaming.  

3. Monks, what do you think? Which is greater: the water in the four great oceans or the tears you have shed while weeping due to meeting what is hateful and parting from what is beloved during your long wandering in samsāra?”  

4. “Venerable sir, as we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, the tears we have shed due to meeting what is hateful and parting from what is beloved during our long wandering in samsāra are far greater than the waters of the four great oceans.”  

5. “Good, good, monks! It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in this way.  

6. Monks, the tears you have shed while weeping due to meeting what is hateful and parting from what is beloved during your long wandering in samsāra are indeed far greater than the waters of the four great oceans.  

7. Monks, for a long time you have experienced the death of a mother.  

8. ...The death of a son.  

9. ...The death of a daughter.  

10. ...The loss of relatives.  

11. ...The loss of wealth.  

12. Monks, for a long time you have experienced the suffering of illness. As you have encountered these losses of illness, met what is hateful, and parted from what is beloved, the tears you shed while weeping are far greater than the waters of the great ocean.  

13. Why is this? Monks, samsāra is without beginning...  

14. Monks, therefore, one should become disenchanted with all formations, dispassionate toward them, and liberated from them.”  

4. Fourth: Milk  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, samsāra is without beginning. Beings roam and wander, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, unable to discern the origin of this wandering and roaming.”  

3. “Monks, what do you think? Which is greater: the milk you have suckled while roaming and wandering through samsāra for a long time, or the waters of the four great oceans?”  

4. “Venerable sir, as we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, the milk we have suckled during our long wandering in samsāra is far greater than the waters of the four great oceans.”  

5. “Good, good, monks! Good, monks! It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in this way.  

6. Monks, the milk you have suckled during your long wandering in samsāra is indeed far greater than the waters of the great ocean.  

7. Why is this? Monks, samsāra is without beginning... one is liberated.”  

5. Fifth: The Mountain  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  

2. Then a monk approached the Blessed One...  

3. Sitting to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how long is an eon?”  

4. “Monk, an eon is long. It is reckoned as many years, so many hundreds of years, so many thousands of years, so many hundreds of thousands of years—beyond calculation.  

5. “Venerable sir, is it possible to give a simile?”  

6. The Blessed One said: “It is possible, monk. Suppose there were a great mountain of solid rock, one league long, one league wide, and one league high, without cracks or crevices. If a person were to stroke it once every hundred years with a Kāsi cloth, monk, that great mountain would eventually be worn away by this method—and still the eon would not have ended.  

7. Monk, so long is an eon. Monk, over such long eons, beings have wandered through many eons, more than hundreds of eons, more than thousands of eons, more than hundreds of thousands of eons.  

8. Why is this? Monks, samsāra is without beginning... one is liberated.”  

6. Sixth: Mustard Seed  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. Then a monk approached the Blessed One...  

3. Sitting to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how long is an eon?”  

4. “Monk, an eon is long... beyond calculation.”  

5. “Venerable sir, is it possible to give a simile?”  

6. “It is possible, monk. Suppose there were an iron city one league long, one league wide, and one league high, filled to the brim with mustard seeds. Then a person, taking one seed every hundred years, would eventually empty that city of all its mustard seeds—and still the eon would not have ended.  

7. Monk, so long is an eon. Monk, over such long eons, beings have wandered through many eons, more than hundreds of eons, more than thousands of eons, more than hundreds of thousands of eons.  

8. Why is this? Monk, samsāra is without beginning... one is liberated.”  

7. Seventh: Disciples  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. Then several monks approached the Blessed One...  

3. Sitting to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how many eons have passed?”  

4. “Monks, countless eons have passed: so many hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of eons—beyond calculation.”  

5. “Venerable sir, is it possible to give a simile?”  

6. “It is possible, monks. Suppose there were four disciples, each with a lifespan of a hundred years, who each day recalled a hundred thousand eons. Monks, even over a century, the eons recalled by them would not be exhausted. After a hundred years, those four disciples would pass away.  

7. Monks, so many eons have passed—hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of eons—beyond calculation.  

8. Why is this? Monks, samsāra is without beginning... one is liberated.”  

8. Eighth: The Ganges  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove...  

2. Then a brahmin approached the Blessed One...  

3. Sitting to one side, the brahmin said to the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, how many eons have passed?”  

4. “Brahmin, countless eons have passed: so many hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of eons—beyond calculation.”  

5. “Master Gotama, is it possible to give a simile?”  

6. “It is possible, brahmin. The sand in the Ganges River, where its waters flow into the ocean, is beyond calculation: so many hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of grains.  

7. Brahmin, even more numerous are the eons that have passed: so many hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of eons—beyond calculation.  

8. Why is this? Brahmin, samsāra is without beginning. Beings roam and wander, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, unable to discern the origin of this wandering and roaming.  

9. Brahmin, they have thus endured suffering, anguish, and loss over the long night, swelling the graveyard. Brahmin, therefore, one should become disenchanted with all formations, dispassionate toward them, and liberated from them.”  

10. Having heard this, the brahmin said: “Excellent, Master Gotama!... From today, let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”  

9. Ninth: The Stick  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, samsāra is without beginning. Beings roam and wander, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, unable to discern the origin of this wandering and roaming...  

3. Monks, just as a stick tossed into the air sometimes falls on its base, sometimes on its middle, and sometimes on its tip, so too do beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving wander through samsāra, migrating from this world to another and from that world to this.  

4. Why is this? Monks, samsāra is without beginning... one is liberated.”  

10. Tenth: The Person  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain.  

2. The Blessed One said:  

3. “Monks, samsāra is without beginning...  

4. Monks, if the bones of a single person wandering through samsāra for one eon were collected, preserved without decay, they would form a pile as massive as Mount Vepulla.  

5. Why is this? Monks, samsāra is without beginning... one is liberated.”  

6. The Blessed One spoke thus. The Well-Gone One then added:  

(1) The bones of a single person over one eon, the Great Sage declares, would form a heap as high as a mountain.  

(2) Such as Mount Vepulla, north of Rājagaha in Magadha—this is the mountain taught by the Great Sage.  

(3) Through correct wisdom, seeing the origin and cessation of suffering, one crosses beyond misery by following the Noble Eightfold Path.  

(4) When one sees the Noble Truths, moving toward suffering’s end, within seven lives at most, all fetters are abandoned: thus comes the end of suffering.
