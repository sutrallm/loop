71. The Meaning of Shramanas and Brahmins  

1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi, at Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.  

2. Then the Blessed One said:  

3. "Monks, whatever shramanas or brahmins do not understand aging-and-death, do not understand the origin of aging-and-death, do not understand the cessation of aging-and-death, and do not understand the path leading to the cessation of aging-and-death—monks, those shramanas and brahmins are not acknowledged as true shramanas or brahmins. Moreover, those venerable ones do not realize for themselves, in this very life, the meaning of being a shramana or the meaning of being a brahmin, nor do they dwell having attained it through direct knowledge.  

4. Monks, whatever shramanas or brahmins understand aging-and-death, understand the origin of aging-and-death, understand the cessation of aging-and-death, and understand the path leading to the cessation of aging-and-death—monks, those shramanas and brahmins are acknowledged as true shramanas and brahmins. Moreover, those venerable ones realize for themselves, in this very life, the meaning of being a shramana and the meaning of being a brahmin, and dwell having attained it through direct knowledge."
