Chapter 2. The Abiding Chapter  

1-11. First. Abiding (1)  

1.  
This was heard by me. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...  

2.  
"Monks, I wish to enter seclusion for half a month. Let no one come to my presence except the one who brings alms."  
"Very well, Venerable Sir!"  
The monks assented to the Blessed One, and except for the one who brought alms, no one approached the Blessed One's dwelling.  

3.  
Then, after half a month, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed the monks:  
"Monks, when I first attained supreme enlightenment, I abided by abiding in dwelling.  

4.  
At that time, I understood: feelings arise dependent on wrong view; feelings arise dependent on right view. [Feelings arise dependent on wrong intention... right intention; wrong speech... right speech; wrong action... right action; wrong livelihood... right livelihood; wrong effort... right effort; wrong mindfulness... right mindfulness;] feelings arise dependent on wrong concentration; feelings arise dependent on right concentration; feelings arise dependent on thoughts; feelings arise dependent on perceptions.  

5.  
If desire is not stilled, thoughts are not stilled, perceptions are not stilled—feelings arise dependent on that. If desire is stilled, but thoughts and perceptions are not stilled—feelings arise dependent on that. If desire and thoughts are stilled but perceptions are not stilled—feelings arise dependent on that. If desire, thoughts, and perceptions are all stilled—feelings arise dependent on that.  

6.  
For what is not yet attained, there is striving. When the attainment is reached, feelings arise dependent on that."  

1-12. Second. Abiding (2)  

1.  
This was heard by me. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...  

2.  
"Monks, I wish to enter seclusion for three months. Let no one come to my presence except the one who brings alms."  
"Very well, Venerable Sir!"  
The monks assented to the Blessed One, and except for the one who brought alms, no one approached the Blessed One's dwelling.  

3.  
Then, after three months, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed the monks:  
"Monks, when I first attained supreme enlightenment, I abided by abiding in dwelling.  

4.  
At that time, I understood: feelings arise dependent on wrong view; feelings arise dependent on the stilling of wrong view; feelings arise dependent on right view; feelings arise dependent on the stilling of right view. [Feelings arise dependent on wrong intention... stilling of wrong intention; right intention... stilling of right intention; wrong speech... stilling of wrong speech; right speech... stilling of right speech; wrong action... stilling of wrong action; right action... stilling of right action; wrong livelihood... stilling of wrong livelihood; right livelihood... stilling of right livelihood; wrong effort... stilling of wrong effort; right effort... stilling of right effort; wrong mindfulness... stilling of wrong mindfulness; right mindfulness... stilling of right mindfulness;] feelings arise dependent on wrong concentration; feelings arise dependent on the stilling of wrong concentration; feelings arise dependent on right concentration; feelings arise dependent on the stilling of right concentration; feelings arise dependent on desire; feelings arise dependent on the stilling of desire; feelings arise dependent on thoughts; feelings arise dependent on the stilling of thoughts; feelings arise dependent on perceptions; feelings arise dependent on the stilling of perceptions.  

5.  
If desire is not stilled, thoughts are not stilled, perceptions are not stilled—feelings arise dependent on that. If desire is stilled, but thoughts and perceptions are not stilled—feelings arise dependent on that. If desire and thoughts are stilled but perceptions are not stilled—feelings arise dependent on that. If desire, thoughts, and perceptions are all stilled—feelings arise dependent on that.  

6.  
For what is not yet attained, there is striving. When the attainment is reached, feelings arise dependent on that."  

1-13. Third. The Learner  

1.  
This was heard by me. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...  

2.  
Then a monk approached the Blessed One... [Having approached, he paid homage and sat to one side.]  

3.  
Seated to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One:  
"Venerable Sir, when one speaks of 'a learner,' what is a learner?"  

4.  
"Monk, here one possesses the learner's right view, [learner's right intention, learner's right speech, learner's right action, learner's right livelihood, learner's right effort, learner's right mindfulness,] learner's right concentration. Monk, one who is thus endowed is called a learner."  

1-14. Fourth. Arising (1)  

1.  
This was heard by me. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...  

2.  
"Monks, if one cultivates and develops these eight things, what is unarisen will arise—except for the non-appearance of a Tathagata, a Worthy One, a Perfectly Enlightened One.  

3.  
What eight? Right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. Monks, if one cultivates these eight, what is unarisen will arise—except for the non-appearance of a Tathagata."  

1-15. Fifth. Arising (2)  

1.  
This was heard by me. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...

3.  
What eight? Right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. Monks, if one cultivates these eight, what is unarisen will arise—except for the untamed state of a Well-Gone One."  

1-16. Sixth. Purification (1)  

1-2.  
This was heard by me. At one time...  

3.  
"Monks, if one purifies these eight things, making them bright, spotless, and free from defilements, what is unarisen will arise—except for the non-appearance of a Tathagata.  

4.  
What eight? Right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. If one purifies these eight, what is unarisen will arise—except for the non-appearance of a Tathagata."

1-2.  
This was heard by me. At one time...  

3.

4.  
What eight? Right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. Monks, purifying these eight, what is unarisen will arise—except for the untamed state of a Well-Gone One."  

1-18. Eighth. The Kukkuṭa Grove (1)  

1.  
This was heard by me. At one time, the Venerable Ānanda and the Venerable Bhadda were dwelling at Pāṭaliputta in the Kukkuṭa Grove.  

2.  
In the evening, the Venerable Bhadda emerged from seclusion and went to the Venerable Ānanda. After greeting him and exchanging courteous words, he sat to one side.  

3.  
Seated to one side, the Venerable Bhadda said to the Venerable Ānanda:  
"Friend Ānanda, when one speaks of 'non-holy life,' what is the non-holy life?"  

4.  
"Excellent, friend Bhadda! Your question is well-framed. You ask: 'What is the non-holy life?'  

5.  
"Friend, the eightfold wrong path is the non-holy life: wrong view, [wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness,] wrong concentration."  

1-19. Ninth. The Kukkuṭa Grove (2)  

1-2.  
This was heard by me. At Pāṭaliputta...  

3.  
"Friend Ānanda, when one speaks of 'holy life,' what is the holy life? What is its culmination?"  

4.  
"Excellent, friend Bhadda! You ask: 'What is the holy life? What is its culmination?'  

5.  
"Friend, the eightfold noble path is the holy life: right view, [right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,] right concentration. The destruction of greed, hatred, and delusion is its culmination."  

1-20. Tenth. The Kukkuṭa Grove (3)  

1-2.  
This was heard by me. At Pāṭaliputta...  

3.  
"Friend Ānanda, when one speaks of 'holy life,' what is the holy life? Who is a holy practitioner? What is its culmination?"  

4.  
"Excellent, friend Bhadda! You ask: 'What is the holy life? Who practices it? What is its culmination?'  

5.  
"Friend, the eightfold noble path is the holy life. One who practices this path is a holy practitioner. The destruction of greed, hatred, and delusion is its culmination."  

These three sutras share the same origin.
