Chapter Three: The Mara Chapter  

[21] First. The Majority  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Silāvatī.  
2. At that time, many bhikkhus were staying not far from the Blessed One—diligent, ardent, and resolute.  
3. Then Māra the Evil One, taking the form of an old Brahmin with matted hair, dressed in an antelope hide, his back bent like a roof beam, his throat wheezing, holding a staff of udumbara wood, approached those bhikkhus and said: "Venerable ones, you are in the prime of youth, with black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the first stage of life. You have not indulged in sensual pleasures. Venerable ones, enjoy human sensual pleasures first! Do not abandon what is visible here and now to pursue what is remote in time."  
4. "Brahmin, we do not abandon what is visible here and now to pursue what is remote. Brahmin, we abandon what is remote and pursue what is visible here and now. For sensual pleasures are remote, full of suffering, full of despair, and greater in danger. This Dhamma is visible here and now, not remote. The Blessed One has declared that it is to be seen by the wise for themselves, leading to Nibbāna, which one who strives can know directly."  
5. When this was said, Māra the Evil One, downcast and disheartened, his forehead furrowed into three lines, left leaning on his staff.  
6. Then those bhikkhus went to the Blessed One. Having paid homage, they sat to one side and reported what had happened.  
7. "Lord, while we were dwelling not far from the Blessed One—diligent, ardent, and resolute—an old Brahmin with matted hair... approached us and said... 'Do not abandon what is visible here and now...'"  
8. "Bhikkhus, that was not a Brahmin. That was Māra the Evil One, who came to confuse you."  
9. Then the Blessed One, understanding the meaning, recited this verse:  
"If one sees suffering’s cause, how could they incline to sensual pleasures? Knowing the world’s bondage, one should train to abandon it."  

[22] Second. Samiddhi  
1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Silāvatī.  
2. Then the Venerable Samiddhi was staying not far from the Blessed One—diligent, ardent, and resolute.  
3. While alone in seclusion, he reflected: "Truly, I have gained great benefit! My Teacher is the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. I have gone forth in the well-expressed Dhamma and Discipline. My companions in the holy life are virtuous and of good character."  
4. Māra, knowing Samiddhi’s thoughts, approached him and made a terrifying noise, as though the earth were splitting.  
5. Samiddhi went to the Blessed One and reported this.  
6. "Samiddhi, that was not the earth splitting. It was Māra trying to disturb you. Remain diligent!"  
7. "Yes, Lord," Samiddhi replied.  
8–10. Again, while reflecting similarly, Māra caused the noise. Samiddhi, recognizing him, spoke a verse:  
"Through faith, I left the home life. My mind is clear, my wakefulness unshaken. Whatever forms Māra takes, I will not tremble."  
11. Māra, realizing failure, vanished.  

[23] Third. Godhika  
1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove.  
2. The Venerable Godhika was staying at Isigili’s Black Rock.  
3–8. Though attaining temporary liberation six times, he repeatedly fell away. Resolving to end his life, he took a knife.  
9–14. Māra, seeking his consciousness, appeared as smoke. The Blessed One declared: "Godhika’s consciousness, having eradicated craving, attains final Nibbāna."  
15–22. Māra searched in vain. The Blessed One recited verses affirming Godhika’s liberation.  

[24] Fourth. Seven Years  
1. The Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvelā by the Nerañjarā River.  
2–3. Māra, failing to find a weakness over seven years, accused him of dwelling in sorrow. The Blessed One replied:  
"Having uprooted sorrow’s root, I meditate free from taint. Why mingle with householders?"  
4–11. Exchanging verses, Māra conceded defeat and left dejected.  

[25] Fifth. Māra’
