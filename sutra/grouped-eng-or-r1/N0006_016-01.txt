5. Kasyapa Samyukta  
1. Santosa  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Monks, this Kasyapa is satisfied with any robe he obtains. He praises satisfaction with any robe obtained. He does not fall into impropriety or wrong conduct because of robes. If he does not obtain a robe, his mind remains unshaken. If he obtains a robe, he does not cling to it. Free from greed, unentangled, seeing danger, he enjoys the wisdom of renunciation.  
3. Monks, this Kasyapa is satisfied with any almsfood he obtains. He praises satisfaction with any almsfood obtained. He does not fall into impropriety or wrong conduct because of almsfood. If he does not obtain almsfood, his mind remains unshaken. If he obtains almsfood, he does not cling to it. Free from greed, unentangled, seeing danger, he enjoys the wisdom of renunciation.  
4. Monks, this Kasyapa is satisfied with any lodging he obtains. He praises satisfaction with any lodging obtained. He does not fall into impropriety or wrong conduct because of lodging. If he does not obtain lodging, his mind remains unshaken. If he obtains lodging, he does not cling to it. Free from greed, unentangled, seeing danger, he enjoys the wisdom of renunciation.  
5. Monks, this Kasyapa is satisfied with any medicinal necessities for illness he obtains. He praises satisfaction with any medicinal necessities obtained. He does not fall into impropriety or wrong conduct because of medicinal necessities. If he does not obtain them, his mind remains unshaken. If he obtains them, he does not cling to them. Free from greed, unentangled, seeing danger, he enjoys the wisdom of renunciation.  
6. Monks, you should train thus: 'We will be satisfied with any robe we obtain... any almsfood... any lodging... any medicinal necessities. If not obtained, our minds will remain unshaken. If obtained, we will not cling. Free from greed, unentangled, seeing danger, we will enjoy the wisdom of renunciation.' You must train in this way. Monks, I admonish you through Kasyapa or those like him. Following this teaching, you will attain accordingly."  

2. Ahirika  
1. Thus have I heard. Once, the Venerable Mahakasyapa and the Venerable Sariputta were dwelling at the Deer Park in Isipatana near Varanasi.  
2. Then, in the evening, the Venerable Sariputta rose from meditation and approached Mahakasyapa... paid respects and sat to one side.  
3. Sitting thus, Sariputta asked Mahakasyapa:  
4. "Friend Kasyapa, without zeal and shame, one does not attain enlightenment, nirvana, or supreme peace. But with zeal and shame, one attains enlightenment, nirvana, and supreme peace."  
5. "Friend, how does one without zeal and shame not attain? How does one with zeal and shame attain?"  
1.  
6. "Friend, a monk who does not arouse zeal against unarisen unwholesome states, does not abandon arisen unwholesome states, does not arouse unarisen wholesome states, and does not maintain arisen wholesome states—this is lack of zeal.  
2.  
7. What is shamelessness? A monk does not feel shame for unarisen unwholesome states, does not abandon arisen ones, does not arouse unarisen wholesome states, and allows arisen wholesome states to decline—this is shamelessness.  
8. Thus, lacking zeal and shame, one does not attain enlightenment, nirvana, or supreme peace.  
3.  
9. What is zeal? A monk arouses zeal against unarisen unwholesome states, abandons arisen ones, arouses unarisen wholesome states, and maintains arisen ones—this is zeal.  
4.  
10. What is shame? A monk feels shame for unarisen unwholesome states, abandons arisen ones, arouses unarisen wholesome states, and maintains arisen ones—this is shame.  
11. Thus, with zeal and shame, one attains enlightenment, nirvana, and supreme peace."  

3. Candupama  
1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. The Blessed One said: "Monks, when entering a householder's home, be like the moon—composed in body and mind, humble as a new monk.  
3. Just as one cautiously approaches a well, cliff, or deep river, monks should approach households with composure and humility. Kasyapa enters households like the moon, humble and composed.  
4. How should a monk conduct himself in a household?"  
5. The monks replied: "The Blessed One is our guide. Please explain."  
6. The Blessed One waved his hand in the air: "Just as this hand does not cling, grasp, or bind to the air, so should a monk's mind in a household—unattached, ungrasping, unbound. Rejoice in what is received, and rejoice in others' gains.  
7. Such a monk is fit to enter households. Kasyapa’s mind remains unattached.  
9. A monk should thus enter households.  
10. What is impure and pure teaching?"  
13. "Impure teaching is given to gain admiration. Pure teaching is given out of compassion, to show the Dhamma leading to nirvana. Kasyapa teaches purely, motivated by compassion.  
16. Monks, follow Kasyapa’s example."  

4. Agarasannivasa  
1. [The Blessed One said:] "How should a monk properly enter a household?"  
4. "A monk should not think: 'Let them give me much, not little; superior, not inferior; quickly, not slowly; respectfully, not disrespectfully.'  
5. If such a monk is not given thus, he resents and suffers. Such a monk is unfit.  
6. A proper monk approaches without such thoughts.  
7. Whether given or not, he remains unshaken. Kasyapa enters thus.  
10. Follow Kasyapa’s example."  

5. Vuddha  
1. Once, the Blessed One was at Rajagaha’s Bamboo Grove.  
2. The Venerable Mahakasyapa approached the Blessed One...  
3. The Blessed One said: "Kasyapa, you are old. Discard your rough rag-robes. Accept householder’s robes and stay near me."  
4. "Lord, I long dwelled in the forest, praised solitude, almsfood, rag-robes, three robes; praised fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, and exertion."  
5. "Why do you praise these?"  
6. "For my present happiness and to inspire later generations. May they practice rightly for welfare and happiness."  
9. "Good, Kasyapa. Act for many’s welfare."  
10. "Then, Kasyapa, keep your rough robes and dwell in the forest."  

6. Ovada (1)  
1. At Rajagaha’s Bamboo Grove...  
3. The Blessed One said: "Kasyapa, admonish the monks. You or I should teach them."  
4. "Lord, it is difficult now. Monks like Bhanda and Abhinjika compete in speaking."  
5. The Blessed One summoned them.  
8. "Did I teach you to compete in verbosity?"  
12. The monks confessed.  
13. "Confessing faults rightly leads to restraint in the Noble Discipline."  

7. Ovada (2)  
1. The Blessed One said: "Kasyapa, teach the monks."  
4. "Those without faith, shame, effort, or wisdom decline like the waning moon.  
8. Those with faith, shame, effort, and wisdom grow like the waxing moon.  
16. Follow their example."  

8. Ovada (3)  
1. At Rajagaha’s Squirrel Sanctuary...  
5. "Formerly, elder monks praised forest dwelling, almsfood, rag-robes, and fewness of wishes. Now monks seek fame and gains. This harms the Sangha."  

9. Samapatti  
1. The Blessed One described attaining the four jhanas, four formless states, cessation, and psychic powers.  
16. "Kasyapa has attained all these and is an arahant."  

10. Vihara  
1. Once, the Venerable Ananda invited Kasyapa to a nun’s dwelling.  
7. Nuns gathered, and Kasyapa taught them.  
10. A nun, Thullatissa, criticized Kasyapa for teaching in Ananda’s presence.  
12. Kasyapa questioned Ananda and demonstrated his attainments.  
33. Thullatissa fell from the holy life.  

11. Civara  
1. At Rajagaha’s Squirrel Sanctuary...  
7. Kasyapa rebuked Ananda for wandering with undisciplined monks.  
13. "I went forth after seeing householder life’s dust. I met the Blessed One and exchanged robes.  
29. I wear his rag-robes as his true heir."  
49. Thullananda fell from the holy life.  

12. Paran  
1. Sariputta asked Kasyapa about the Tathagata’s existence after death.  
8. "The Buddha did not declare this, as it is unrelated to the path. He taught suffering, its origin, cessation, and the path."  

13. Saddhammapativirala  
1. Kasyapa asked why few monks now attain wisdom.  
4. "When beings decline, the true Dhamma fades. Counterfeit Dhamma arises.  
6. Like counterfeit gold replacing true gold.  
13. Five factors cause decline: disrespect towards the Teacher, Dhamma, Sangha, training, and concentration.  
17. Five factors sustain the Dhamma: respect and compliance."
