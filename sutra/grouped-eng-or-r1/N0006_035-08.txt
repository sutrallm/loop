3. The Sickness Chapter  

[74] 1. Sickness (1)  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Buddha's dwelling...  

3. Seated to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Buddha: "Venerable Sir, in this monastery there is a newly ordained bhikkhu, little known, who is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. Venerable Sir, may the Blessed One out of compassion go to that bhikkhu's dwelling."  

4. Then the Buddha, hearing the words "newly ordained" and "afflicted," understood that the bhikkhu was "little known," and went to his dwelling.  

5. That bhikkhu saw the Buddha coming from afar and tried to rise from his bed.  

6. The Buddha said to him: "Enough, bhikkhu! Do not rise from your bed. There is a seat prepared here; I will sit there." The Buddha sat down on the prepared seat.  

7. Seated, the Buddha said to the bhikkhu: "Bhikkhu, are you tolerating your sickness? Are your supports adequate? Is your pain decreasing, not increasing—do you see its decrease, not its increase?"  
"Venerable Sir, I am not tolerating my sickness. My supports are inadequate. My painful feelings are increasing, not decreasing. I see their increase, not their decrease."  

8. "Bhikkhu, do you have any remorse? Do you have any regret?"  
"Venerable Sir, indeed I have much remorse and regret."  

9. "But are you troubled by your virtue?"  
"Venerable Sir, no."  

10. "If you are not troubled by your virtue, then for what do you have remorse? What is your regret?"  
"Venerable Sir, I do not yet understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One for the purification of virtue."  

11. "Bhikkhu, if you do not yet understand the Dhamma I teach for the purification of virtue, then what do you understand me to teach?"  
"Venerable Sir, I understand the Blessed One to teach the abandoning of lust."  

12. "Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand me to teach the abandoning of lust. Bhikkhu, I do teach this Dhamma for the abandoning of lust.  

13. Bhikkhu, what do you think? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?"  
"Venerable Sir, impermanent."  
"Are the ear... nose... tongue... body... mind permanent or impermanent?"  
"Venerable Sir, impermanent."  
"What is impermanent, is that suffering or happiness?"  
"Venerable Sir, suffering."  
"What is impermanent, suffering, and of a nature to change—would one rightly regard it as 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?"  
"Venerable Sir, no."  

14. "Bhikkhu, seeing thus, a learned noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, the ear... nose... tongue... body... becomes disenchanted with the mind. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there is the knowledge: 'Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'"  

15. When this was said, that bhikkhu rejoiced in the Blessed One's words. While this discourse was being spoken, the bhikkhu's mind was freed from the taints without clinging.  

[75] 2. Sickness (2)  

1–10. [Same as above.]  

11. "Bhikkhu, if you do not yet understand the Dhamma I teach for the purification of virtue, then what do you understand me to teach?"  
"Venerable Sir, I understand the Blessed One to teach the extinction of clinging, Nibbāna without grasping."  

12. "Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand me to teach the extinction of clinging, Nibbāna without grasping. Bhikkhu, I do teach this Dhamma for the extinction of clinging, Nibbāna without grasping."  

13–14. [Same as above.]  

15. When this was said, that bhikkhu rejoiced in the Blessed One's words. While this discourse was being spoken, his mind was freed from the taints without clinging.  

[76] 3. Rādha (1)  

2. Then the Venerable Rādha...  

3. Seated to one side, Rādha said to the Buddha: "Venerable Sir, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Having heard it, I will dwell alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute."  

4. "Rādha, you should abandon desire for whatever is impermanent.  

5–9. What is impermanent? Rādha, the eye is impermanent; abandon desire for it. Forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—pleasant, painful, or neutral—that too is impermanent; abandon desire for it. The ear... sounds... nose... odors... tongue... tastes... body... touches...  

10. The mind is impermanent; abandon desire for it. Mental phenomena... mind-consciousness... mind-contact... whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—pleasant, painful, or neutral—that too is impermanent; abandon desire for it.  

11. Rādha, you should abandon desire for whatever is impermanent."  

[77] 4. Rādha (2)  

4. "Rādha, you should abandon desire for whatever is suffering.  

5–10. What is suffering? Rādha, the eye is suffering; abandon desire for it. Forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—pleasant, painful, or neutral—that too is suffering; abandon desire for it. The ear... sounds... nose... odors... tongue... tastes... body... touches... The mind... mental phenomena... mind-consciousness... mind-contact... whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—pleasant, painful, or neutral—that too is suffering; abandon desire for it.  

11. Rādha, you should abandon desire for whatever is suffering."  

[78] 5. Rādha (3)  

4. "Rādha, you should abandon desire for whatever is non-self.  

5–9. What is non-self? Rādha, the eye is non-self; abandon desire for it. Forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—pleasant, painful, or neutral—that too is non-self; abandon desire for it. The ear... sounds... nose... odors... tongue... tastes... body... touches...  

10. The mind is non-self; abandon desire for it. Mental phenomena... mind-consciousness... mind-contact... whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—pleasant, painful, or neutral—that too is non-self; abandon desire for it.  

11. Rādha, you should abandon desire for whatever is non-self."  

[79] 6. Ignorance (1)  

2. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Buddha...  

3. Seated to one side, he said: "Venerable Sir, is there one thing which, when abandoned, causes a bhikkhu's ignorance to vanish and true knowledge to arise?"  

4. "Bhikkhu, there is one thing: ignorance. Abandoning this one thing, a bhikkhu's ignorance vanishes and true knowledge arises."  

5. "But Venerable Sir, how does a bhikkhu know and see so that ignorance vanishes and true knowledge arises?"  

6. "Bhikkhu, when a bhikkhu knows and sees the eye as impermanent, ignorance vanishes and true knowledge arises. Forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... feelings born of eye-contact... as impermanent.  

7–11. The ear... sounds... nose... odors... tongue... tastes... body... touches... mind... mental phenomena...  

12. Bhikkhu, knowing and seeing thus, ignorance vanishes and true knowledge arises."  

[80] 7. Ignorance (2)  

1–5. [Same as above.]  

6. "Bhikkhu, here a bhikkhu has heard: 'Nothing is worth clinging to.' Having heard this, he directly knows all things. Having fully known all things, he fully understands all things. Fully understanding all things, he sees all signs as other. He sees the eye as other... forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... feelings born of eye-contact... Similarly with ear... mind...  

7. Bhikkhu, knowing and seeing thus, ignorance vanishes and true knowledge arises."  

[81] 8. The Bhikkhu  

2. Then several bhikkhus approached the Buddha...  

3. Seated to one side, they said: "Venerable Sir, when ascetics of other sects ask us: 'Friends, what is the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?'—how should we answer?"  

4. "Bhikkhus, when asked thus, you should answer: 'Friends, it is for the full understanding of suffering that we lead the spiritual life under the Buddha.'  

5. If they ask: 'What is that suffering?'—reply:  

6–11. 'The eye is suffering; for its full understanding we lead the spiritual life. Forms... eye-contact... feelings... Similarly with ear... mind...  

12. This is the suffering we seek to fully understand. Thus, bhikkhus, you should reply."  

[82] 9. The World  

2. Then a bhikkhu approached the Buddha...  

3. Seated to one side, he asked: "Venerable Sir, in what sense is 'the world' called 'the world'?"  

4–9. "Bhikkhu, it is disintegrating (lujjati), thus it is called 'the world.' What disintegrates? The eye disintegrates. Forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... feelings born of eye-contact... Similarly with ear... mind...  

10. Bhikkhu, it disintegrates; thus it is called 'the world.'"  

[83] 10. Puṇṇiya  

2. Then the Venerable Puṇṇiya...  

3. Seated to one side, he asked:  

4–8. "Venerable Sir, is there an eye through which the past Buddhas awakened to full enlightenment, cut off craving's fetter, destroyed craving's path, ended cyclic existence, and transcended suffering? Similarly for ear... nose... tongue... body...  

9. Venerable Sir, is there a mind through which they did so?"  

10–14. "Puṇṇiya, there is no eye... ear... nose... tongue... body...  

15. Puṇṇiya, there is no mind through which the past Buddhas awakened to full enlightenment. Rather, having understood the Dhamma, they cut off craving's fetter, ended cyclic existence, and transcended suffering."
