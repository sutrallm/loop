1. Division of Elements  
[1] 1. The Eye  
1. Thus have I heard: At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  
2. Then, the Venerable Rāhula approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat aside.  
3. Sitting aside, Rāhula said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, may the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Having heard it, I will dwell alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute."  
4. "Rāhula, what do you think: Is the eye permanent or impermanent?" — "Impermanent, Venerable Sir." — "Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?" — "Suffering, Venerable Sir." — "Is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as 'this is mine,' 'this is I,' 'this is my self'?" — "No, Venerable Sir."  
This should be briefly understood as follows:  
5. "Is the ear permanent or impermanent?" — "Impermanent, Venerable Sir."  
6. "Is the nose permanent or impermanent?" — "Impermanent, Venerable Sir."  
7. "Is the tongue permanent or impermanent?" — "Impermanent, Venerable Sir."  
8. "Is the body permanent or impermanent?" — "Impermanent, Venerable Sir."  
9. "Is the mind permanent or impermanent?" — "Impermanent, Venerable Sir." — "Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?" — "Suffering, Venerable Sir." — "Is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as 'this is mine,' 'this is I,' 'this is my self'?" — "No, Venerable Sir."  
10. "Rāhula, when a noble disciple sees thus, they become disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with the ear, disenchanted with the nose, disenchanted with the tongue, disenchanted with the body, disenchanted with the mind.  
11. Being disgusted, they become dispassionate. Through dispassion, they are liberated. In liberation, the knowledge arises: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of existence.'”  
12. Through this explanation, the Ten Discourses should be understood.
