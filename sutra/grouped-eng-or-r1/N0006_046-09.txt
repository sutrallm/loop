9. The Great Discourse on the Ganges (Departing)  

〔77〕1.  

2. "Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges river flows towards the east, slopes towards the east, and inclines towards the east, so too a bhikkhu who cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment and frequently develops them flows towards Nibbāna, slopes towards Nibbāna, and inclines towards Nibbāna.  

Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment and frequently develop them so as to flow towards Nibbāna, slope towards Nibbāna, and incline towards Nibbāna?  

3.  

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the mindfulness enlightenment factor through dispassion, through fading away, through cessation, and matures in relinquishment... [He develops the discrimination-of-states enlightenment factor... the energy enlightenment factor... the rapture enlightenment factor... the tranquility enlightenment factor... the concentration enlightenment factor]... he develops the equanimity enlightenment factor.  

Bhikkhus, it is in this way that a bhikkhu [cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment and frequently develops them so as to flow towards Nibbāna, slope towards Nibbāna, and incline towards Nibbāna]."  

〔78–88〕2–12.  

Up to the Search Chapter should be expounded in full.  

Verses of Consolidation:  

Six concerning flowing east,  
Six concerning reaching the sea,  
Two sets of six make twelve—  
Thus this chapter is taught.
