2. The Section on Elements and Aggregates  

2.1 First: The Eye  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. Then Venerable Rāhula approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One said to him as he sat there:  

3. "Rāhula, what do you think? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?" "Venerable Sir, it is impermanent."  

4. "Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?" "Venerable Sir, it is suffering."  

5. "Is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as: ‘This is mine. This I am. This is my self’?" "Venerable Sir, it is not."  

6–17. "The ear... nose... tongue... body...  

18. Is the mind permanent or impermanent?" "Venerable Sir, it is impermanent."  

19. "Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?" "Venerable Sir, it is suffering."  

20. "Is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change as: ‘This is mine. This I am. This is my self’?" "Venerable Sir, it is not."  

21. "Rāhula, when a noble disciple sees thus, he becomes disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with the ear, nose, tongue, and body...  

22. Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there arises the knowledge: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no further coming to any state of being.’"  

Through such exposition, the ten discourses should be understood.

21–22. "Rāhula, when one sees thus... one understands: ‘...There is no further coming to any state of being.’"  

2.11 Eleventh: Influxes  

1. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. Then Venerable Rāhula approached the Blessed One... and said:  

3. "Venerable Sir, how does one know and see so that regarding this conscious body and all external signs, the notions ‘I’ and ‘mine’ and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer arise?"  

4. "Any form—past, present, or future; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near—all form is seen with right wisdom as: ‘This is not mine. This I am not. This is not my self.’ Any feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

Any consciousness—past, present, or future; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near—all consciousness is seen with right wisdom as: ‘This is not mine. This I am not. This is not my self.’  

5. Rāhula, knowing and seeing thus, the notions ‘I’ and ‘mine’ and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer arise regarding this conscious body and all external signs."  

2.12 Twelfth: Detachment  

1. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. Then Venerable Rāhula approached... and said:  

3. "Venerable Sir, how does one know and see so that regarding this conscious body and all external signs, the mind is liberated from the ‘I’ and ‘mine’ conceit, surpassing it and attaining peaceful release?"  

4. "Any form—past, present, or future; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near—all form is seen with right wisdom as: ‘This is not mine. This I am not. This is not my self.’ Thus seeing, one is liberated through non-clinging.  

The same applies to the five aggregates.  

5–8. Any feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

Any consciousness—past, present, or future; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near—all consciousness is seen with right wisdom as: "This is not mine. This I am not. This is not my self."  

9. Rāhula, knowing and seeing thus, the mind is detached from the ‘I’ and ‘mine’ conceit regarding this conscious body and all external signs, surpassing it and attaining peaceful release."  

The verses state:  
The eye and forms and consciousness up to contact and feeling,  
Perception, volition, cravings, elements, aggregates—ten in total.
