5. The Chapter on Verses About Meritorious Deeds  

41. First on Moistening (1)  

2. "Monks, there are four kinds of moistening by merit, moistening by goodness, and food of bliss. What are these four?  

3. Monks, here a noble disciple possesses confirmed faith in the Buddha, thus: 'That Blessed One is an arhat, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, a sublime one, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.' This is the first moistening by merit, moistening by goodness, and food of bliss.  

Monks, further, a noble disciple possesses confirmed faith in the Dhamma... in the Sangha... and possesses the virtue dear to the noble ones, unbroken, unblemished, unspotted, untarnished, liberative, praised by the wise, uncorrupted, and conducive to concentration. This is the fourth moistening by merit, moistening by goodness, and food of bliss. Monks, these are the four kinds of moistening by merit, moistening by goodness, and food of bliss.  

4. Monks, the merit of a noble disciple endowed with these four kinds of moistening by merit and goodness is not easy to measure. It is reckoned as an incalculable, immense mass of merit.  

5. Monks, suppose one were to measure the water in the great ocean by pots—hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of pots. Such measurement would not be easy. It would be reckoned as an incalculable, immense mass of water. Similarly, monks, the merit of a noble disciple endowed with these four kinds of moistening by merit and goodness... is reckoned as an incalculable, immense mass of merit."  

6. The Blessed One spoke thus. Having said this, the Well-Gone One, the Teacher, further said:  

The great ocean, immeasurable,  
Treasure-store, source of awe—  
All rivers flow into it,  
Yet it never overflows.  
Thus gifts given to the wise—Food, drink, clothes, beds, seats—  
Flow into the stream of merit,  
Like rivers merging into the sea.

This is the fourth moistening by merit, moistening by goodness, and food of bliss. Monks, these are the four kinds...  

4. Monks, the merit of a noble disciple endowed with these four... is not easy to measure... reckoned as an incalculable, immense mass of merit.

5. The Blessed One spoke thus...:

When the King of Death comes, one does not tremble.
