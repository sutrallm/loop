[118–127] 1–9  

[128] 10. Upper Fetters  
2.  
"Bhikkhus, there are five higher fetters. What are the five? Desire for form, desire for the formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. These are the five higher fetters.  
Bhikkhus, to fully understand... thoroughly comprehend... completely eradicate and abandon these five higher fetters, one should cultivate the five faculties. What are the five?  

3.  
Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith that leads to relinquishment through detachment, dispassion, and cessation. He develops the faculty of energy... faculty of mindfulness... faculty of concentration... faculty of wisdom.  
Bhikkhus, to fully understand... thoroughly comprehend... completely eradicate and abandon these five higher fetters, one should cultivate these five faculties."  

The summary verses state:  
Floods, yokes, grasping, bonds, latent tendencies, sensual pleasures up to hindrances, aggregates, and lower/upper fetters.  

The chapter on floods with reliance on detachment is well expounded in connection with the faculties.
