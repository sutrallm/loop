2. The Arhat Chapter  

63. First: Grasping  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was staying in Savatthi...  

2. Then a monk approached the Blessed One’s dwelling. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat to one side.  

3. Sitting to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One:  
"Venerable Sir, may the Blessed One briefly teach me the Dhamma. Having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I will dwell alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute."  

4. "Monk, when one grasps, one is bound by Mara; when one does not grasp, one is liberated from Mara."  
"Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Fortunate One!"  

5. "Monk, how do you understand in detail the brief meaning I have stated?"  

6. "Venerable Sir, when one grasps form, one is bound by Mara; when one does not grasp form, one is liberated from Mara. When one grasps feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness, one is bound by Mara; when one does not grasp consciousness, one is liberated from Mara. Venerable Sir, this is how I understand in detail the brief meaning spoken by the Blessed One."  

7. "Good, good, monk! You have correctly understood in detail the brief meaning I stated. When one grasps form... feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness, one is bound by Mara; when one does not grasp, one is liberated from Mara. Monk, you should regard the brief meaning I stated in this way."  

8. Then that monk, rejoicing in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, paid homage, circumambulated the Blessed One, and departed.  

9. Then, dwelling alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute, that monk soon realized the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth into homelessness. He directly knew: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done has been done; there is nothing further beyond this."  

10. That monk became an Arhat.  

64. Second: Thought  

1–2. [At that time, the Blessed One] was staying in Savatthi...  

3. Sitting to one side, that monk said to the Blessed One:  
"Venerable Sir, may the Blessed One briefly teach me the Dhamma... resolute."  

4. "Monk, when one thinks, one is bound by Mara; when one does not think, one is liberated from Mara."  
"Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Fortunate One!"  

5. "Monk, how do you understand in detail the brief meaning I have stated?"  

6. "Venerable Sir, when one thinks of form, one is bound by Mara; when one does not think of form, one is liberated from Mara. When one thinks of feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness, one is bound by Mara; when one does not think of consciousness, one is liberated from Mara. Venerable Sir, this is how I understand in detail the brief meaning spoken by the Blessed One."

8–10. ...That monk became an Arhat.  

65. Third: Delight  

1–3. [At that time, the Blessed One] was staying in Savatthi...

4–8. "Radha, whatever form—past, future, present, internal, external, gross, subtle, inferior, superior, far, near—one sees with right wisdom as it truly is: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’...  

9. Radha, knowing and seeing thus, one eliminates the conceit ‘I am,’ the tendency to ‘mine,’ and the latent conceit regarding this conscious body and all external phenomena."
