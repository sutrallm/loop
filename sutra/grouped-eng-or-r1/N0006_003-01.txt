1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Bhagavā was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  
2. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Bhagavā. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Bhagavā and sat down to one side.  
3. Sitting to one side, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Bhagavā: “Venerable Gotama, have you declared the realization of the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment?”  
4. “Great king, those who rightfully speak of realizing the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, it is I who have realized it. Great king, I am one who has realized the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.”  
5. “But Gotama, there are ascetics and brahmins—leaders of orders, well-known teachers, esteemed as saints by many—such as Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Kakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala. When asked if they have declared the realization of the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, they do not claim it. How then could the Venerable Gotama, so young in years and newly gone forth, make such a declaration?”  
6. “Great king, there are four things that should not be despised because they are young. What are the four? A young khattiya should not be despised. A young snake should not be despised. A small fire should not be despised. A young bhikkhu should not be despised. These four, though young, should not be despised.”  
7. The Bhagavā then uttered these verses:  
“A khattiya of noble birth, though young, should not be scorned. Do not look down upon him or treat him with contempt. For he may gain sovereignty, the wrath of a king brings punishment. Guard your own life to avoid such harm. A snake encountered in village or forest, though small, should not be scorned. Its flickering flames can strike the foolish, bringing suffering in their wake. A fire, though tiny with blackened crest, should not be scorned. Fed with fuel, it blazes fiercely, consuming the unwise. A bhikkhu who burns with virtue’s fire should be revered. If they scorch like a forest flame, leaving no heirs or wealth, their sprouts of existence severed like a palmyra stump—thus the wise, seeing their own good, heed the snake, fire, noble, and monk.”  
8. When this was spoken, King Pasenadi of Kosala said: “Excellent, Bhagavā! Just as one might set upright what was overturned, reveal the hidden, point the way to the lost, or hold a lamp in the dark, so the Bhagavā has made the Dhamma clear. I go for refuge to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. May the Bhagavā accept me as a lay follower from this day forth.”  

[2] 2. Person  
1. ...At Sāvatthī.  
2. King Pasenadi approached the Bhagavā, paid respects, and sat aside.  
3. He asked: “Bhagavā, how many qualities arise in a person that lead to harm, suffering, and unrest?”  
4. “Three qualities: greed, hatred, delusion. These bring harm, suffering, and unrest.”  
5. ...The Bhagavā then said:  
“Greed, hate, and delusion—springing from within—harm the fool like a bamboo’s self-destruction.”  

[3] 3. The King  
1. ...At Sāvatthī.  
2. The king asked: “Is there anyone exempt from aging and death?”  
3. “No, great king. All beings age and die.  
4. Even the wealthy, with abundant gold and grain, cannot escape.  
5. Even brahmins of great wealth meet the same fate.  
6. Even the arahant’s body, though freed from defilements, is subject to decay.”  
7. The Bhagavā then said:  
“Royal chariots age, bodies decay. The Dhamma of the good does not age—thus the wise proclaim.”  

[4] 4. Self-Love  
1. ...At Sāvatthī.  
2. The king reflected: “Who loves themselves? Who does not?”  
3. “Those acting unskillfully through body, speech, or mind do not love themselves, even if they claim to. Those acting skillfully do love themselves, even if they deny it.”  
5. The Bhagavā affirmed this.  
6. He then said:  
“Knowing oneself dear, avoid evil. No happiness comes to wrongdoers. At death, what remains but one’s deeds? Like a shadow, they follow. So do good—it is your refuge hereafter.”  

[5] 5. Self-Protection  
1. ...The king questioned self-protection.  
2. “One who acts unskillfully is unprotected, even with armies. One who acts skillfully is self-protected, needing no armies.”  
5. The Bhagavā agreed.  
6. He said:  
“Well restrained in body, speech, and mind—the guarded, shame-aware one is truly protected.”  

[6] 6. The Few  
1. ...At Sāvatthī.  
2. The king noted: “Few, wealthy yet heedful; many, wealthy and heedless.”  
3. The Bhagavā confirmed this.  
4. He said:  
“Blinded by wealth and lust, they stray like snared deer. Bitter their fate—such is evil’s fruit.”  

[7] 7. Judgment  
1. ...The king observed rich men lying for pleasure.  
2. The Bhagavā said: “Such deceit brings lasting harm.”  
4. He added:  
“Greedy, trapped in delusion, they sink like netted fish. Bitter their fate—such is evil’s fruit.”  

[8] 8. Mallikā  
1. ...The king and Queen Mallikā conversed on a terrace.  
2. Each claimed none dearer than themselves.  
3. The Bhagavā said:  
“Though one searches all directions, none is dearer than oneself. Thus, harm not others for self-love’s sake.”  

[9] 9. Sacrifice  
1. ...The king prepared a great sacrifice: 500 bulls, goats, etc.  
4. The bhikkhus reported the weeping servants.  
6. The Bhagavā said:  
“Horse, human, or club sacrifices yield scant fruit. Sages harm none. Right sacrifice—harmless, virtuous—brings heaven’s praise.”  

[10] 10. Bonds  
1. ...The king bound prisoners with ropes, nets, chains.  
4. The Bhagavā said:  
“Iron, wood, or hemp bonds are not the strongest. Obsession with jewels, sons, wives—these bind the mind. Cut them, renounce, and be free.”
