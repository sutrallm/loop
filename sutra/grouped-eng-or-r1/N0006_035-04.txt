The ear is... sounds are... the nose is... odors are... the tongue is... flavors are... the body is... tactile objects are...  

8. The mind is produced by birth; mental phenomena are produced by birth; mind-consciousness is produced by birth; mind-contact is produced by birth; whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is produced by birth.
