1. The First on Solitude (1) 1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. 2. Then the Venerable Anuruddha, secluded in a solitary place, thought: "One who neglects the four establishments of mindfulness neglects the noble path leading to the complete destruction of suffering. One who undertakes the four establishments of mindfulness undertakes the noble path leading to the complete destruction of suffering." 3. Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, knowing the Venerable Anuruddha’s thought through his own mind, as swiftly as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, appeared before the Venerable Anuruddha. 4. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to the Venerable Anuruddha: "Friend Anuruddha, how does a bhikkhu become accomplished in the four establishments of mindfulness?" 5. "Friend, here a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in the internal body, the vanishing phenomena in the internal body, and both the arising and vanishing phenomena in the internal body—ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having subdued worldly covetousness and distress. 6. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in the external body... 7. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in both the internal and external body... 8. If he wishes: 'May I dwell perceiving the unrepulsive as repulsive,' he dwells perceiving it as repulsive. If he wishes: 'May I dwell perceiving the repulsive as unrepulsive,' he dwells perceiving it as unrepulsive. If he wishes: 'May I dwell perceiving both the unrepulsive and repulsive as repulsive,' he dwells perceiving them as repulsive. If he wishes: 'May I dwell perceiving both the repulsive and unrepulsive as unrepulsive,' he dwells perceiving them as unrepulsive. If, abandoning both the unrepulsive and repulsive, he wishes to dwell equanimous, mindful, and fully aware, he dwells equanimous, mindful, and fully aware. 9. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in internal feelings... 10. ...external feelings... 11. ...both internal and external feelings... 12. ...and so on... 13. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in the internal mind... 14. ...external mind... 15. ...both internal and external mind... 16. ...and so on... 17. He dwells contemplating the arising phenomena in internal phenomena... 18. ...external phenomena... 19. ...both internal and external phenomena... 20. If he wishes... until... he dwells equanimous, mindful, and fully aware. 21. Friend, it is in this way that a bhikkhu becomes accomplished in the four establishments of mindfulness." 2. The Second on Solitude (2) 1. At Sāvatthī. 2. Then the Venerable Anuruddha, secluded in a solitary place, thought: "One who neglects the four establishments of mindfulness neglects the path leading to the complete destruction of suffering. One who undertakes the four establishments of mindfulness undertakes the path leading to the complete destruction of suffering." 3. Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna... appeared before the Venerable Anuruddha. 4. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said: "Friend Anuruddha, how does a bhikkhu become accomplished in the four establishments of mindfulness?" 5. "Friend, here a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body—ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having subdued worldly covetousness and distress. He dwells contemplating the body externally... both internally and externally... 6. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings... 7. ...the mind in the mind... 8. ...phenomena in phenomena... 9. Friend, it is in this way that a bhikkhu becomes accomplished in the four establishments of mindfulness." 3. The Third at the Hand-Washing Pond 1. Once the Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling at Sāvatthī by the Hand-Washing Pond. 2. Many bhikkhus approached him and exchanged greetings. 3. They asked: "Venerable, through developing and cultivating what have you attained great direct knowledge?" 4. "Friends, it is through developing and cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness. I dwell contemplating the body in the body... feelings... mind... phenomena in phenomena—ardent, fully aware, mindful, having subdued worldly covetousness and distress. 5. Friends, through this, I understand inferior things as inferior, middling as middling, and superior as superior." 4. The Fourth at Kaṇṭakī (1) 1. Once the Venerable Anuruddha dwelled at Sāketa in the Kaṇṭakī Grove with Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. 2. In the evening, Sāriputta approached Anuruddha and asked: "What should a trainee bhikkhu develop?" 3. "A trainee should develop the four establishments of mindfulness: contemplating the body... feelings... mind... phenomena—ardent, fully aware, mindful..." 5. The Fifth at Kaṇṭakī (2) 1-2. Similarly... Sāriputta asked: "What should a perfected one develop?" 3. "A perfected one should likewise develop the four establishments." 6. The Sixth at Kaṇṭakī (3) 1-2. ...Sāriputta asked: "Through what have you attained great direct knowledge?" 3. "Through developing the four establishments... 5. ...I understand a thousandfold world." 7. The Seventh on the Destruction of Craving 1. At Sāvatthī. 2. Anuruddha addressed the bhikkhus: "Developing the four establishments of mindfulness leads to the destruction of craving. Contemplate the body... feelings... mind... phenomena..." 8. The Eighth at the Pine Forest 1. Once Anuruddha dwelled at Sāvatthī in the Pine Forest. 2. He said: "Just as the Ganges flows eastward, so a bhikkhu developing the four establishments cannot revert to lay life. His mind inclines to seclusion." 9. The Ninth on All 1. At Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Grove. 2. Sāriputta asked Anuruddha: "How do you dwell?" 3. "I dwell with mind well-established in the four establishments. Contemplating body... feelings... mind... phenomena... 5. Even an arahant dwells thus." 10. The Tenth on Severe Illness 1. At Sāvatthī in the Dark Forest. 2. Bhikkhus asked: "How do you endure bodily pain?" 3. "By establishing the four establishments... contemplating body... feelings... mind... phenomena..." The First Chapter on Solitude. The summary verses: Two on solitude, the Hand-Washing Pond, three at Kaṇṭakī, craving’s end, Pine Forest, all, and severe illness.
