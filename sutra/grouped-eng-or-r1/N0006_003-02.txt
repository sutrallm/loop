2. Kosala Chapter  

11. First: The Matted-Hair Ascetic  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi, in the Eastern Park, in the palace of Migara's mother.  

2. Then, in the late afternoon, the Blessed One rose from his solitary meditation and sat down on a seat prepared at the entrance of his dwelling. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.  

3. At that time, seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Niganthas, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers with long underarm and body hair, long nails, and carrying travel provisions passed by not far from the Blessed One.  

4. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, joined his palms toward those seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Niganthas, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers, and proclaimed his name three times: "Venerable ones, I am King Pasenadi of Kosala! Venerable ones, I am King Pasenadi of Kosala!"  

5. Then, after those seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Niganthas, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers had left, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.  

6. Sitting there, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, are those among the world's arahants or those who have entered the path to arahantship?"  

7. "Great king, whether those are arahants or ones on the path to arahantship is not easy for a householder like you—enjoying sensual pleasures, living crowded with children, using sandalwood from Kasi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics, and hoarding gold and silver—to know.  

8. Great king, one's virtue is to be known through living together, not through a short time; by one who is attentive, not by a heedless person; by one who is wise, not by an unwise person.  

9. Great king, one's integrity is to be known through discussion, not through a short time; by one who is attentive, not by a heedless person; by one who is wise, not by an unwise person.  

10. Great king, one's fortitude is to be known through adversity, not through a short time; by one who is attentive, not by a heedless person; by one who is wise, not by an unwise person.  

11. Great king, one's wisdom is to be known through consultation, not through a short time; by one who is attentive, not by a heedless person; by one who is wise, not by an unwise person."  

12. "It is amazing, venerable sir! It is astonishing, venerable sir! How well this has been stated by the Blessed One: 'Great king, whether those are arahants or ones on the path to arahantship is not easy for a householder like you—enjoying sensual pleasures... to know.'  

13. These men, venerable sir, are my spies and scouts, returning after spying around the country. First they investigate, and then I will question them.  

14. But now, after they have bathed and anointed themselves, shaved off their hair and beards, dressed in white clothes, they will indulge in the five strands of sensual pleasure."  

15. Then the Blessed One, understanding the meaning of this, uttered this verse:  

A person's outward appearance cannot be easily known,  
Do not hastily trust a fleeting glance.  
For well-restrained ones who move through the world  
Like counterfeit earrings made of clay,  
Or a copper half-coin coated in gold:  
Impure within, they parade in beauty.  

12. Second: The Five Kings  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi...]  

2. Then, King Pasenadi of Kosala, as one of five kings, surrounded by the five strands of sensual pleasure, was fully enjoying himself. On that occasion, this topic arose among them: "What is the foremost object of sensual desire?"  

3. Then some said: "Forms are the foremost object of sensual desire." Others said: "Sounds are the foremost." Some said: "Smells are the foremost." Others said: "Tastes are the foremost." Some said: "Tactile sensations are the foremost." None of the kings could convince each other.  

4. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed the other kings: "Come, friends! Let us go to the Blessed One and ask him about this matter. Whatever the Blessed One says, we should accept."  

5. The five kings agreed: "So be it, friend."  

6. Then those five kings, led by Pasenadi, approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and sat down to one side.  

7. Sitting there, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, we five kings, surrounded by the five strands of sensual pleasure, were fully enjoying ourselves. Among us, this topic arose: 'What is the foremost object of sensual desire?' Some said forms, others sounds, smells, tastes, or tactile sensations. Venerable sir, what is the foremost object of sensual desire?"  

8. "Great king, I say that the foremost object of sensual desire is whatever a person's mind delights in most. Great king! Some forms are delightful to the mind, others are not. One who is attached to forms and finds satisfaction in them desires no higher or subtler forms. For him, that form is supreme.  

9. Great king! Similarly, some sounds... smells... tastes... tactile sensations are delightful to the mind, others are not. One who is attached to tactile sensations and finds satisfaction in them desires no higher or subtler tactile sensations. For him, that tactile sensation is supreme."  

10. At that time, the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was sitting in that assembly. He rose from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, joined his palms toward the Blessed One, and said: "Venerable sir, inspiration strikes me! Blessed One, inspiration strikes me!"  

11. The Blessed One said: "Candanaṅgalika, express it."  

12. Then Candanaṅgalika, in the Blessed One's presence, recited a suitable verse:  

Like the fragrant red lotus blooming at dawn,  
Whose scent does not fade,  
See the dazzling rays of the sun,  
Illuminating the sky like a radiant orb.  

13. Then the five kings each offered Candanaṅgalika five sets of robes.  

14. Candanaṅgalika, in turn, offered those five sets of robes to the Blessed One.  

13. Third: The Great Meal  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi...] At that time, King Pasenadi of Kosala would eat a whole Dona measure of rice.  

2. After eating, King Pasenadi, breathing heavily, approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and sat down to one side.  

3. Knowing that King Pasenadi had eaten excessively, the Blessed One then uttered this verse:  

A man who eats mindfully, in moderation,  
Will have little pain, age slowly, and live long.  

4. At that time, the youth Sudassana was standing behind King Pasenadi.  

5. King Pasenadi said to Sudassana: "Sudassana, memorize this verse and recite it to me when I eat. I will grant you a hundred coins daily."  

6. Sudassana replied: "Yes, Your Majesty," and memorized the verse. When the king ate, he recited:  

A man who eats mindfully, in moderation,  
Will have little pain, age slowly, and live long.  

7. Gradually, King Pasenadi reduced his intake to a single Dona measure of rice.  

8. As his health improved, King Pasenadi patted his body and joyfully declared: "Truly, the Blessed One has shown me compassion in both this life and the next!"  

14. Fourth: Two Verses on War (First)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi...] Then Ajatasattu Vedehiputta, King of Magadha, mobilized his fourfold army to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala in Kasi.  

2. Hearing this, King Pasenadi mobilized his own fourfold army and confronted Ajatasattu in Kasi.  

3. In the ensuing battle, Ajatasattu defeated Pasenadi, who retreated to Savatthi.  

4. Many monks, after their alms rounds, reported this to the Blessed One.  

5. The Blessed One said: "Monks, Ajatasattu has bad friends, companions, and associates. Pasenadi has good ones. Yet Pasenadi, being defeated, will sleep poorly tonight."  

6. Then the Blessed One uttered this verse:  

Victory breeds enmity,  
The defeated lie in pain.  
The peaceful sleep at ease,  
Having abandoned victory and defeat.  

15. Fifth: Two Verses on War (Second)  

9. Again, Ajatasattu attacked Kasi.  

10. Pasenadi, hearing this, mobilized his forces and defeated Ajatasattu, capturing him.  

11. Pasenadi, considering Ajatasattu his nephew, confiscated his army and released him.  

12. When monks reported this, the Blessed One uttered:  

One who seeks gain by oppressing others,  
Will in turn be oppressed.  
A fool, mistaking evil for good,  
Suffers when wickedness ripens.  
Killing begets killers,  
Conquering begets conquerors,  
Insulting brings insults,  
Harassing invites harassment.  
Thus, by the cycle of action,  
The plunderer is plundered.  

16. Sixth: The Princess  

1. At Savatthi...  

2. King Pasenadi approached the Blessed One and sat down.  

3. A messenger whispered: "Queen Mallika has borne a daughter."  

4. The king was displeased.  

5. The Blessed One, perceiving this, recited:  

A wise and virtuous woman,  
Respected by her husband and kin,  
Gives birth to a heroic son,  
A ruler of the land.  
Such a noble wife  
Is worthy of a kingdom.  

17. Seventh: Diligence (First)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi...]  

2. King Pasenadi asked: "Is there a single quality that secures both present and future welfare?"  

3. The Blessed One replied: "Diligence. Just as an elephant's footprint encompasses all others, diligence encompasses both present and future welfare."  

4. Then the Blessed One uttered:  

Life, health, beauty, heaven, high birth—  
The wise praise diligence in meritorious deeds.  
The diligent attain both present and future good;  
By achieving this, the wise are called heroes.  

18. Eighth: Diligence (Second)  

1. King Pasenadi reflected: "The Blessed One's teaching emphasizes good friendship."  

2. The Blessed One confirmed: "Good friends lead to the Noble Eightfold Path. By cultivating right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, one attains liberation."  

3. He urged the king to cultivate diligence and good friendship, concluding:  

Persevering in their aims,  
Desiring treasures,  
The wise praise diligence in merit.  
The diligent gain twofold welfare—  
Present and future.  
Achieving this, the wise are heroes.  

19. Ninth: The Heirless (First)  

1. King Pasenadi reported the death of a wealthy miser.  

2. The Blessed One likened misused wealth to a desert pool—unused and wasted.  

3. He contrasted it with virtuous wealth use, benefiting oneself and others, leading to heaven.  

4. The verse concluded:  

Like a desert pond unused,  
A miser's wealth brings no joy.  
But the wise use wealth well,  
Nurturing kin and ascending to heaven.  

20. Tenth: The Heirless (Second)  

1. The same miser's fate was explained: past merits brought temporary wealth, but miserliness and murder led to hell.  

2. The Blessed One concluded:  

Wealth, grain, gold, or slaves—  
None follow one at death.  
Only deeds, like shadows, pursue.  
Thus, perform good deeds—  
Merit is the raft to future bliss.
