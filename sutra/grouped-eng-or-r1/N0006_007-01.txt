1. The Arhat Chapter  
[1] 1. Dharani Ja Ren  

1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary in Rajagaha.  

2. At that time, the wife of a Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan, named Dharani Ja Ren, had faith in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.  

3. Then, Dharani Ja Ren, while bringing food to the Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan, uttered words of rejoicing three times: “Homage to the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One... Homage to the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One.”  

4. Having spoken thus, the Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan said to Dharani Ja Ren: “This slave girl constantly praises the virtues of that bald-headed ascetic. Slave girl! Now I shall refute your teacher.”  

5. “No, Brahmin! In the world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, among the multitude of ascetics, Brahmins, humans, and devas, none can refute the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Therefore, Brahmin, go! Go and find out for yourself.”  

6. Then, the Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan, angry and displeased, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and sat to one side.  

7. Sitting to one side, the Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan addressed the Blessed One in verse:  
“What should one kill to sleep blissfully?  
What should one kill to grieve no more?  
What single thing does Gautama praise  
As fitting to be slain?”  

8. [The Blessed One:] “Kill anger, and sleep blissfully.  
Kill anger, and grieve no more.  
Brahmin, the killing of anger—  
That poisonous root, sweet as honey—  
Is praised by the noble ones.  
Slaying it, one does not grieve.”  

9. Having spoken thus, the Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan said to the Blessed One: “Gautama, excellent! Gautama, supreme! Just as one raises the fallen, reveals the hidden, shows the path to the lost, or holds a lamp in darkness, so the Gautama has expounded the Dharma in various ways. I take refuge in the Blessed One Gautama, the Dharma, and the Sangha. May I receive the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One Gautama!”  

10. The Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan received the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One.  

11. Not long after his full ordination, the Venerable Bharadvaja dwelled alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute. Being a son of good family who had gone forth from home into homelessness for the sake of the supreme holy life, he realized for himself: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence.”  

12. Thus, the Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the Arhats.  

[2] 2. Slander  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary in Savatthi.  

2. The slandering Brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan heard that the Brahmin Bharadvaja had gone forth from home into homelessness under the ascetic Gautama.  

3. Angry and displeased, he approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he harshly reviled and insulted the Blessed One with abusive words.  

4. When he finished speaking, the Blessed One said to the slandering Brahmin Bharadvaja: “Brahmin, what do you think? Do friends, relatives, guests, or kinsmen visit you?”  

5. “Yes, Gautama. Sometimes friends, relatives, guests, or kinsmen visit me.”  

6. “Brahmin, what do you think? Do you offer them hard food, soft food, or delicacies?”  

7. “Yes, Gautama. I sometimes offer them hard food, soft food, or delicacies.”  

8. “Brahmin, if they do not accept them, to whom do the offerings belong?”  

9. “Gautama, if they do not accept them, the offerings remain mine.”  

10. “Brahmin, just so, I do not accept your slander, abuse, or insult. These belong to you alone. Slander returns to the slanderer, abuse to the abuser, insult to the insulter. Brahmin, this is shared between host and guest. I do not partake in this. Brahmin, this is yours. Brahmin, this is yours.”  

11. “The king and his ministers know the Venerable Gautama thus: ‘The ascetic Gautama is an Arhat, yet he still gets angry!’”  

12. [The Blessed One:] “One free from anger, self-controlled, living righteously—  
A sage, tamed, enlightened—  
For such a one, where can anger arise?  
Returning anger with anger makes matters worse.  
Not returning anger, one wins a double victory.  
Knowing the other’s anger, calm and mindful,  
One benefits both oneself and others.  
Healing both sides, such a one—  
A physician for self and others—  
Is called wise.  
Those ignorant of Dharma deem this folly.”  

13. Having spoken thus, the slandering Brahmin Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One: “Supreme is the Blessed One... I now go for refuge to the Blessed One Gautama, the Dharma, and the Sangha. May I receive the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One Gautama!”  

14. The slandering Brahmin Bharadvaja received the going forth and full ordination under the Blessed One.  

15. Not long after his full ordination, the Venerable Slandering Bharadvaja dwelled alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute. Being a son of good family who had gone forth from home into homelessness for the sake of the supreme holy life, he realized for himself: “Birth is destroyed... no more coming to any state of existence.”  

16. Thus, the Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the Arhats.
