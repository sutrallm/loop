2. Food  
[11] 1. Food  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of nutriment for the sustenance of beings already born and for the assistance of beings seeking birth. What are the four? They are: physical food, whether coarse or fine; contact as the second; mental volition as the third; and consciousness as the fourth. These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of nutriment for the sustenance of beings already born and for the assistance of beings seeking birth."  

3. "Bhikkhus, what is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for these four kinds of nutriment? They are craving. Craving is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for these four kinds of nutriment."  

4. "Bhikkhus, what is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for craving? It is feeling. Feeling is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for craving."  

5. "Bhikkhus, what is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for feeling? It is contact. Contact is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for feeling."  

6. "Bhikkhus, what is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for contact? It is the six sense bases. The six sense bases are the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for contact."  

7. "Bhikkhus, what is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for the six sense bases? It is name-and-form. Name-and-form is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for the six sense bases."  

8. "Bhikkhus, what is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for name-and-form? It is consciousness. Consciousness is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for name-and-form."  

9. "Bhikkhus, what is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for consciousness? It is volitional formations. Volitional formations are the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for consciousness."  

10. "Bhikkhus, what is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for volitional formations? It is ignorance. Ignorance is the cause, the origin, the source, the condition for volitional formations."  

11. "Bhikkhus, thus with ignorance as condition, volitional formations arise; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness arises; ... Thus is the origination of this whole mass of suffering."  

12. "With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness; ... Thus is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."  

[12] 2. Poṭṭhapāda  
1. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī. [The Blessed One said:]  
2. "Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of nutriment for the sustenance of beings already born and for the assistance of beings seeking birth. What are the four? They are: physical food, whether coarse or fine; contact as the second; mental volition as the third; and consciousness as the fourth. These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of nutriment..."  

3. When this was said, the Venerable Poṭṭhapāda addressed the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, who consumes the consciousness nutriment?" The Blessed One said: "The question is not rightly framed. I have not said, 'One consumes.' If I had said, 'One consumes,' then the question 'Who consumes?' would be appropriate. But since I did not speak thus, the proper question should be: 'What is the condition for consciousness nutriment?' To this the correct answer is: 'Consciousness nutriment is the condition for future renewed existence. With consciousness as condition, there is the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact.'"  

4. "Venerable sir, who experiences contact?" The Blessed One said: "The question is not rightly framed. I have not said, 'One experiences contact.' If I had said, 'One experiences contact,' then the question 'Who experiences contact?' would be appropriate. But since I did not speak thus, the proper question should be: 'What is the condition for contact?' The correct answer is: 'With the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling.'"  

5. "Venerable sir, who feels?" The Blessed One said: "The question is not rightly framed... The correct answer is: 'With contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving.'"  

6. "Venerable sir, who craves?" The Blessed One said: "The question is not rightly framed... The correct answer is: 'With feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging.'"  

7. "Venerable sir, who clings?" The Blessed One said: "The question is not rightly framed... The correct answer is: 'With craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; ... Thus is the origination of this whole mass of suffering.  

8. "Poṭṭhapāda, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six sense bases comes cessation of contact; with cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease. Thus is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."  

[13] 3. Ascetics and Brahmins (1)  
1. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī.  
2. The Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins who do not understand aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; who do not understand birth... existence... clinging... craving... feeling... contact... the six sense bases... name-and-form... consciousness... volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation—these ascetics and brahmins I do not consider to be true ascetics or brahmins. They do not, in this very life, realize for themselves with direct knowledge the goal of asceticism or brahminhood and dwell in its fulfillment.  

3. "But bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins who understand aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; who understand birth... existence... clinging... craving... feeling... contact... the six sense bases... name-and-form... consciousness... volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation—these ascetics and brahmins I consider to be true ascetics or brahmins. They, in this very life, realize for themselves with direct knowledge the goal of asceticism or brahminhood and dwell in its fulfillment."  

[14] 4. Ascetics and Brahmins (2)  
1. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī.  
2. The Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand these things, their origin, their cessation, and the path leading to their cessation...  
3. "What things? Aging-and-death, birth, existence, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, volitional formations, ignorance...  
4. "Such ascetics and brahmins do not understand these things...  
5. "These ascetics and brahmins I do not consider to be true ascetics or brahmins...  

6. "But those ascetics or brahmins who understand these things, their origin, their cessation, and the path leading to their cessation...  
7. "What things? Aging-and-death... volitional formations...  
8. "These ascetics and brahmins understand these things...  
9. "Such ascetics and brahmins I consider to be true ascetics or brahmins..."  

[15] 5. Kaccāyana  
1. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī.  
2. Then the Venerable Kaccāyana approached the Blessed One...  
3. Seated to one side, he said: "Venerable sir, what is right view?"  
4. The Blessed One said: "Kaccāyana, this world mostly relies on the duality of existence and non-existence.  
5. But one who sees with right wisdom the arising of the world as it is does not hold to non-existence. One who sees with right wisdom the cessation of the world as it is does not hold to existence.  
6. The world is for the most part shackled by clinging, resolves, and tendencies. If one does not cling, resolve, or tend towards 'I am,' then such a disciple, unperplexed, free from doubt, understanding not by others’ help, here and now realizes: 'Suffering arises with conditions; suffering ceases with conditions.'  
7. Kaccāyana, 'All exists'—this is one extreme. 'All does not exist'—this is the second extreme. The Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: 'With ignorance as condition, volitional formations arise... Such is the origination of this whole mass of suffering.  
8. With the cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations... Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."  

[16] 6. The Dhamma Speaker  
1. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī.  
2. A bhikkhu approached the Blessed One...  
3. He asked: "Venerable sir, what is a speaker of Dhamma?"  
4. The Blessed One said: "If a bhikkhu teaches for the sake of disenchantment with aging-and-death, for its fading away and cessation, he is a speaker of Dhamma.  
5. If he practices in accordance with the Dhamma for the cessation of aging-and-death, he practices the Dhamma rightly.  
6. If, through disenchantment with aging-and-death, through fading away and cessation, he is liberated without clinging, he attains Nibbāna in this very life.  
7. Similarly regarding birth, existence, clinging, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense bases, name-and-form, consciousness, volitional formations, ignorance... Such a bhikkhu is a speaker of Dhamma..."  

[17] 7. Acela  
1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.  
2. One morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl, and entered Rājagaha for alms.  
3. The naked ascetic Kassapa saw the Blessed One and addressed him. After exchanges, he stood to one side and asked:  
4. "Is suffering self-made?" The Blessed One: "Not so, Kassapa."  
5. "Is suffering other-made?"  
6. "Not so, Kassapa."  
7. "Is suffering both self-made and other-made?"  
8. "Not so, Kassapa."  
9. "Is suffering neither self-made nor other-made, a chance product?"  
10. "Not so, Kassapa."  
11. "Then is there no suffering?"  
12. "Kassapa, suffering exists. I do not deny suffering. I know and see suffering."  
13. Kassapa requested the Buddha to explain.  
14. The Buddha said: "If one asserts suffering as self-made, that is eternalism. If other-made, that is annihilationism. The Tathāgata teaches the middle way: 'With ignorance as condition, volitional formations arise... Such is the origination of suffering. With cessation of ignorance... cessation of suffering.'"  
15. Hearing this, Kassapa took refuge and became a monk. Later, he attained arahantship.  

[18] 8. Diṭṭhamangalika  
1. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī.  
2. The wanderer Diṭṭhamangalika approached...  
3. He asked: "Is pleasure and pain self-made?" ...  
4. The Blessed One refuted all extremes and taught dependent origination. Diṭṭhamangalika took refuge as a lay follower.  

[19] 9. The Fool and the Wise  
1. At Sāvatthī. The Blessed One taught:  
2. "Fools, enveloped in ignorance and bound by craving, assume a body. Through contact, they experience pleasure and pain.  
3. The wise too experience pleasure and pain.  
4. But the fool, not dispelling ignorance or craving, is reborn and remains bound to suffering.  
5. The wise, dispelling ignorance and craving through the holy life, are liberated from rebirth and suffering."  

[20] 10. Conditionality  
1. At Sāvatthī. The Blessed One taught:  
2. "I will teach dependent origination and dependently arisen phenomena.  
3. Aging-and-death is conditioned by birth; birth by existence; existence by clinging; clinging by craving; craving by feeling; feeling by contact; contact by six sense bases; six sense bases by name-and-form; name-and-form by consciousness; consciousness by volitions; volitions by ignorance. Whether Tathāgatas arise or not, this law remains.  
4. All these are impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to cessation, fading away, and cessation.  
5. A noble disciple, seeing this with wisdom, does not speculate about past, future, or present existence. He understands reality and is liberated."
