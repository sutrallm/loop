"Bhikkhus, through what cause, by clinging to what, through craving for what does such a view arise: 'The wind does not blow, rivers do not flow, a pregnant woman does not give birth, the sun and moon do not rise or set, standing firm like a pillar'?"

"Venerable sir, the Blessed One is the root of our teachings..."

"Bhikkhus, because there is form, by clinging to form, through craving for form, such a view arises: 'The wind does not blow... like a pillar standing firm.'  

6-9  

Because there is feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness, by clinging to consciousness, through craving for consciousness, such a view arises: 'The wind does not blow... like a pillar standing firm.'  

10-15  

"What do you think, bhikkhus? Is form permanent or impermanent?"  

"Venerable sir, it is impermanent..."  

"By not clinging to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could such a view arise: 'The wind does not blow... like a pillar standing firm'?"  

"Venerable sir, no..."  

16  

"Bhikkhus, thus because there is suffering, by clinging to suffering, through craving for suffering, such a view arises: 'The wind does not blow... like a pillar standing firm.'"
