3. The Tenth Power  

21. First: The Ten Powers (1)  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi.  

2. The Blessed One declared: "Monks, the Tathagata is endowed with the Ten Powers, the four fearlessnesses, proclaims the bull-leader's matters, utters the lion's roar in assemblies, turns the supreme wheel, and liberates beings.  

[He teaches thus]: Form is such and such; the origin of form is such and such; the cessation of form is such and such. Feeling is such and such; the origin of feeling is such and such; the cessation of feeling is such and such. Perception is such and such; the origin of perception is such and such; the cessation of perception is such and such. Volitional formations are such and such; the origin of volitional formations is such and such; the cessation of volitional formations is such and such. Consciousness is such and such; the origin of consciousness is such and such; the cessation of consciousness is such and such.  

When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.  

3. With ignorance as condition, volitional formations arise; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness arises... Thus is the origin of this entire mass of suffering.  

4. Through the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; through cessation of volitional formations comes cessation of consciousness... Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering."  

22. Second: The Ten Powers (2)  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi.  

2-4. [The Blessed One declared:] "Monks, the Tathagata is endowed with the Ten Powers... Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.  

5. Monks, just as my well-proclaimed Dhamma was made manifest to remove bondage,  

6. so should a virtuous person of good family, having gone forth out of faith, train diligently such that even if his body’s skin, tendons, and bones waste away and his flesh and blood dries up, he will not relax his effort until he attains what is unattained through human vigor, energy, and exertion.  

7. For monks, the indolent dwell in suffering, covered by unwholesome states, diminishing great benefits. The diligent dwell in bliss, abandoning unwholesome states, fulfilling great benefits.  

8. The lowest cannot reach the supreme, but by the supreme one attains the supreme. This holy life is present as the supreme. Therefore, train to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and realize the unrealized.  

9. Thus our going forth is not empty but fruitful and beneficial. Through this, we use robes, food, lodging, and medicines, though humble, yielding great fruit and benefit.  

10. Monks, train thus: heedful regarding self-welfare; heedful regarding others' welfare; heedful regarding both."  

23. Third: Causation  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] "Monks, I declare the cessation of taints through knowing and seeing, not without knowing and seeing.  

3. Knowing and seeing what leads to cessation? Knowing form as such, its origin, cessation; feeling... perception... volitions... consciousness as such, their origin, cessation. Thus knowing and seeing, taints cease.  

4. At cessation, knowledge of cessation has a condition, not none.  

5-19. The condition for cessation-knowledge is liberation; for liberation, dispassion; for dispassion, revulsion; for revulsion, true knowledge; for true knowledge, concentration; for concentration, joy; for joy, tranquility; for tranquility, happiness; for happiness, faith; for faith, suffering; for suffering, birth; for birth, existence; for existence, clinging; for clinging, craving; for craving, feeling; for feeling, contact; for contact, six sense bases; for six sense bases, name-and-form; for name-and-form, consciousness; for consciousness, volitional formations;  

20-25. For volitional formations, ignorance. Thus with ignorance as condition, formations arise... Such is the origin of suffering.  

26. Just as rain pours on mountain peaks, flowing downwards to fill rivers and finally the ocean,  

27. so too, dependent on ignorance arise formations... Such is the arising of suffering.  

28. With cessation of ignorance, formations cease... Such is the cessation of suffering."  

24. Fourth: Wanderers  

1. [Once] the Blessed One dwelled at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove.  

2. Venerable Sariputta entered Rajagaha for alms.  

3-4. Approaching wanderers, they asked Sariputta: "Some teach suffering as self-made, other-made, both, or causeless. How does the Ascetic Gotama explain this?"  

5-9. Sariputta replied: "The Blessed One teaches suffering as dependently originated through contact. Whether others claim self-made suffering or other positions, all presuppose contact. Those who assert self-made suffering without contact are ignorant."  

10-25. Venerable Ananda reported this dialogue. The Blessed One affirmed Sariputta’s correctness, recounting a past discussion where he similarly taught dependent origination via contact.  

26-31. When asked about causes of aging-and-death, existence, etc., the correct answer lies in conditionality. Through ending ignorance, the entire mass of suffering ceases.  

25. Fifth: Punnamantani  

1. The Blessed One dwelled in Savatthi.  

2-7. Venerable Punna asked about teachers who attribute pleasure and pain to self, others, both, or neither. The Buddha affirmed: "Pleasure and pain arise dependently through contact. Any theory ignoring contact is ignorant."  

8-19. Sensual, verbal, and mental intentions rooted in ignorance cause pleasure and pain. When ignorance ceases, intentions cease, leaving no ground for pleasure or pain.  

26. Sixth: Upanisa  

1-7. When asked about suffering's cause, the Buddha taught dependent arising through contact, refuting theories of self-made, other-made, or causeless suffering without contact’s role.  

27. Seventh: Causation  

1-13. The Buddha detailed the twelve links of dependent origination, emphasizing understanding each factor’s cessation through the Noble Eightfold Path.  

28. Eighth: The Monk  

1-37. A monk who fully understands dependent origination—its arising, cessation, and path—is deemed a true seer, liberated through right knowledge.  

29-30. Ninth-Tenth: Ascetics and Brahmins  

1-25. Those ignorant of dependent origination are false ascetics. Those comprehending it are genuine, having realized the goal.  

Thus concludes the section on the Ten Powers, causation, and refutations of wrong views.
