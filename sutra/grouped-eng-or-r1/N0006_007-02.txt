2. The Lay Follower Chapter  

[11] First: Plowing  

1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Magadha, in the southern hills of the brahmin village called Ekasiṅga.  

2. At that time, the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja was preparing for sowing, with five hundred plows fitted.  

3. Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning and taken his bowl, went to the workplace of the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja.  

4. At that time, the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja was distributing food to the workers.  

5. The Blessed One approached the place where food was being distributed and stood to one side.  

6. The brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One standing for alms and said: "Ascetic, I plow and sow, then eat. You too should plow and sow, then eat."  

7. "Brahmin, I too plow and sow, then eat."  

8. "But we do not see Gotama’s yoke, plow, share, goad, or oxen. Yet you say you plow and sow."  

9. Then the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja addressed the Blessed One in verse:  
"You claim to be a farmer,  
But your plowing I do not see.  
Tell me, farmer,  
How is your plowing done?"  

10. [The Blessed One:] "Faith is the seed,  
Austerity the rain,  
Wisdom my yoke and plow,  
Modesty the pole,  
Mindfulness the plowshare and goad.  
Guarded in body and speech,  
Moderate in food,  
Truthfulness my weeding tool,  
Delight in release my unyoking,  
Effort my beast of burden,  
Carrying me safely onward.  
It goes without turning back,  
To where, gone, one grieves no more.  
Such is my plowing,  
Yielding the deathless fruit.  
Having plowed thus,  
One is freed from all suffering."  

11. "Let the Venerable Gotama eat! The Venerable Gotama is indeed a farmer. Gotama’s plowing bears the fruit of deathlessness."  

12. [The Blessed One:] "Food over which verses are recited  
Is not to be eaten by me.  
This, brahmin, is the rule  
Of those who see.  
The Enlightened Ones reject such fare  
When verse is used as payment.  
Brahmin, dwell in the Dhamma  
As the holy ones live.  
With taints destroyed,  
Cooled and fulfilled,  
Serve food for the sake of merit,  
A field for those seeking merit."  

13. Then the brahmin Kasi Bhāradvāja said: "Excellent, Venerable Gotama!... From this day forth, let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower."  

[12] Second: Udāyin  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and went to the house of the brahmin Udāyin.  

3. There, the brahmin Udāyin filled the Blessed One’s bowl with rice.  

4. A second time the Blessed One went to Udāyin’s house...  

5. A third time the brahmin Udāyin filled the bowl and said: "This pesky ascetic Gotama comes again and again!"  

6. [The Blessed One:] "Repeatedly they sow the seed,  
Repeatedly the sky rains.  
Repeatedly farmers plow the fields,  
Repeatedly crops are grown.  
Repeatedly beggars seek alms,  
Repeatedly donors give.  
Repeatedly donors give,  
Repeatedly heavenward they go.  
Repeatedly milk is drawn,  
Repeatedly calves seek dams.  
Repeatedly toil and weariness come,  
Repeatedly fools enter the womb.  
Repeatedly they are born and die,  
Repeatedly carried to the grave."  

7. Then the brahmin Udāyin said: "Excellent, Venerable Gotama!... From this day forth, accept me as a lay follower."  

[13] Third: Devala the Dark  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. The Blessed One had a cold. Venerable Upavāna was his attendant.  

3. The Blessed One said: "Upavāna, fetch me warm water."  

4. "Yes, Lord," replied Upavāna. Taking his bowl, he went to the house of Devala the Dark and stood silently.  

5. Devala addressed him in verse:  
"Silently stands the shaven-head,  
Clad in a robe. What do you seek?  
What need brings you here to beg?"  

6. [Upavāna:] "The Worthy One, the Enlightened Sage,  
Is afflicted by a cold.  
If warm water can be given,  
Bestow it on the Holy One,  
Who is worthy of offerings."  

7. Devala gave him warm water and molasses.  

8. Venerable Upavāna returned and gave the water to the Blessed One. Mixing molasses in it, he presented it.  

9. The Blessed One recovered.  

10. Devala visited the Blessed One. After exchanging greetings, he asked in verse:  

11. "To whom should gifts be given?  
Where does offering bear great fruit?  
In what sphere does sacrifice  
Grow most abundant?"  

12. [The Blessed One:] "One who knows past lives,  
Sees heaven and hell,  
Has reached the end of rebirth,  
A sage perfected in insight—  
Give to such ones:  
This gift bears great fruit.  
Sacrifice in such a sphere  
Grows most abundant."  

13. Then Devala said: "Excellent, Venerable Gotama!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[14] Fourth: The Wealthy One  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. A wealthy brahmin, pretending poverty, approached the Blessed One.  

3. The Blessed One asked: "Why do you feign poverty?"  

4. "My four sons, influenced by wives, expelled me."  

5. "Memorize this verse and recite it when they gather:  
‘I longed for their birth, their growth;  
With wives they drove me out like dogs.  
They call me ‘father’ without love—  
Cruel sons! Worse than a staff  
That wards off dogs, steadies steps,  
Raises the fallen. So I beg.  
Better this staff than thankless sons.’"  

6. The brahmin did so. His sons restored him.  

7. Grateful, he offered a garment to the Blessed One, who accepted out of compassion.  

8. The brahmin said: "Excellent, Venerable Gotama!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[15] Fifth: Arrogance  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. A brahmin named Arrogant disrespected parents, teachers, and elders.  

3. The Blessed One was teaching.  

4. Arrogant thought: "If he speaks to me, I’ll reply; else, not."  

5. He stood silently.  

6. The Blessed One remained silent.  

7. As Arrogant turned to leave,  

8. The Blessed One read his mind and said in verse:  
"Brahmin, abandon pride.  
Having come for merit,  
Engage rightly, Brahmin."  

9. Arrogant prostrated and declared his name.  

10. The crowd marveled at this transformation.  

11. The Blessed One said: "Sit, your faith pleases me."  

12. Arrogant asked in verse:  
"To whom should one defer?  
Whom honor above all?"  

13. [The Blessed One:] "Honor mother, father,  
Elders, teachers.  
The pure, taintless ones—  
Arahants worthy of offerings.  
Discard pride and arrogance."  

14. Then he said: "Excellent, Venerable Gotama!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[16] Sixth: Contrarian  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. A brahmin named Contrarian resolved to oppose the Blessed One.  

3. He found the Blessed One pacing outdoors.  

4. Joining him, he said: "Ascetic, teach!"  

5. [The Blessed One:] "An angry, quarrelsome mind,  
Stained, stubborn, hostile,  
Cannot grasp the well-taught Dhamma.  
Only by removing envy’s veil  
Does one understand."  

6. Contrarian said: "Excellent, Venerable Gotama!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[17] Seventh: The Carpenter  

1. While dwelling in Kosala’s forest,  

2. A carpenter brahmin entered on business.  

3. He saw the Blessed One meditating under a sal tree.  

4. "Why does this ascetic find joy here?"  

5. Approaching, he asked in verse:  
"Alone in the deep forest,  
Monk, what joy do you find?"  

6. [The Blessed One:] "Done is what should be done.  
No bonds here, no thorns.  
Free from discontent,  
I dwell unshaken."  

7. The carpenter said: "Excellent!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[18] Eighth: Firewood Gatherers  

1. In Kosala’s forest,  

2. Brahmin students collecting firewood saw the Blessed One meditating.  

3. They reported this to their teacher, who visited and asked in verse:  
"Alone in perilous woods,  
Calm and unshaken—why?"  

4. [The Blessed One:] "Cravings and attachments severed,  
Free from desire, pure in sight,  
I meditate safely,  
Attained the Deathless."  

5. The brahmin said: "Excellent!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[19] Ninth: Filial  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. A filial brahmin asked: "I support my parents lawfully. Is this right?"  

3. [The Blessed One:] "Yes. Great merit comes from this.  
Such a one is praised here,  
Reborn in heaven after death."  

4. The brahmin said: "Excellent!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[20] Tenth: The Beggar  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. A begging brahmin said: "We both beg. Is there any difference?"  

3. [The Blessed One:] "One who begs is not a monk.  
A true monk, by wisdom pure,  
Abandons evil, lives the holy life."  

4. The brahmin said: "Excellent!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[21] Eleventh: Sangārava  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. Sangārava, a water-purifying brahmin, bathed ritually.  

3. Venerable Ānanda reported this to the Blessed One.  

4. Visiting, the Blessed One asked: "Why bathe so?"  

5. "To wash away daily sins."  

6. [The Blessed One:] "Virtue is the cleansing pool.  
Bathe there to cross the flood."  

7. Sangārava said: "Excellent!... Accept me as a lay follower."  

[22] Twelfth: Khomadussa  

1. At Khomadussa.  

2. The Blessed One approached a hall where brahmins mocked him.  

3. He spoke in verse:  
"Where no wise gather,  
No true assembly lies.  
Those rejecting greed, hate, delusion,  
Who speak truth, are truly wise."  

4. The brahmins said: "Excellent!... Accept us as lay followers."  

Summary:  
Plowing, Udāyin, Devala, Wealthy, Arrogance, Contrarian, Carpenter, Firewood, Filial, Beggar, Sangārava, Khomadussa—twelve in total.
