1. First Chapter: Mountain Section  

1.1. First: Snow Mountain  

1-2  
At Savatthi... the Blessed One said:  

3  
"Monks, just as an elephant relies on the snow mountain to increase its body and gain strength—having increased its body and gained strength there, it enters a small pond, then a large pond, then a small river, then a large river, and finally the great ocean, where its body becomes vast—  

4  
so too, monks, a monk who relies on virtue, established in virtue, cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment. By cultivating them frequently, they attain vastness in all wholesome qualities.  

5  
How does a monk, relying on virtue and established in virtue, cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment, thereby attaining vastness in all wholesome qualities?  

6  
Here, monks, a monk cultivates the mindfulness enlightenment factor by relying on seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment. Similarly, he cultivates the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor, the energy enlightenment factor, the joy enlightenment factor, the tranquility enlightenment factor, the concentration enlightenment factor, and the equanimity enlightenment factor.  

Thus, monks, a monk relying on virtue, established in virtue, cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment. By frequent cultivation, they attain vastness in all wholesome qualities."  

1.2. Second: The Body  

1-2  
At Savatthi...  

3  
"Monks, just as this body depends on food to exist, relying on food, and cannot exist without it, so too do the five hindrances depend on food to arise, persist, and grow.  

4  
What, monks, is the food that causes unarisen sensual desire to arise and arisen sensual desire to increase? It is the feature of attractiveness. Improper attention to this feeds unarisen sensual desire and increases arisen sensual desire.  

5  
What feeds the arising of unarisen ill will and increases arisen ill will? The feature of irritation. Improper attention to this feeds unarisen ill will and increases arisen ill will.  

6  
What feeds the arising of unarisen sloth-and-torpor and increases arisen sloth-and-torpor? Boredom, lethargy, dullness, overeating, and mental sluggishness. Improper attention to these feeds unarisen sloth-and-torpor and increases arisen sloth-and-torpor.  

7  
What feeds the arising of unarisen restlessness-and-worry and increases arisen restlessness-and-worry? Mental unrest. Improper attention to this feeds unarisen restlessness-and-worry and increases arisen restlessness-and-worry.  

8  
What feeds the arising of unarisen doubt and increases arisen doubt? Things that are doubtful. Improper attention to these feeds unarisen doubt and increases arisen doubt.  

9  
Just as this body relies on food, so too do these five hindrances rely on food."  

10  
"Monks, just as this body relies on food, so too do the seven factors of enlightenment rely on food.  

11  
What food causes the unarisen mindfulness enlightenment factor to arise and the arisen one to be fully developed? The qualities associated with mindfulness. Proper attention to this feeds the arising of unarisen mindfulness and the development of the arisen mindfulness enlightenment factor.  

12  
What feeds the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor? Distinguishing wholesome and unwholesome qualities, blameworthy and blameless states, inferior and superior, dark and bright. Proper attention to these develops the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor.  

13  
What feeds the energy enlightenment factor? The element of exertion, persistence, and striving. Proper attention to these develops the energy enlightenment factor.  

14  
What feeds the joy enlightenment factor? The qualities associated with joy. Proper attention to these develops the joy enlightenment factor.  

15  
What feeds the tranquility enlightenment factor? Physical and mental tranquility. Proper attention to these develops the tranquility enlightenment factor.  

16  
What feeds the concentration enlightenment factor? The sign of serenity and undistractedness. Proper attention to these develops the concentration enlightenment factor.  

17  
What feeds the equanimity enlightenment factor? The qualities associated with equanimity. Proper attention to these develops the equanimity enlightenment factor.  

18  
Just as this body relies on food, so too do these seven factors of enlightenment rely on food."  

1.3. Third: Virtue  

2  
"Monks, if a monk is endowed with virtue, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the knowledge of liberation, he is called one whose vision is highly effective.  

3  
So too, his listening, approach, service, recollection, and going forth are highly effective.  

4  
Why? Because such a monk, having heard the Dhamma, dwells in seclusion both physically and mentally. Thus secluded, he recollects and examines the Dhamma.  

5  
Developing the mindfulness enlightenment factor, he perfects it. Established in mindfulness, he discriminates and investigates the Dhamma with wisdom.  

6  
This gives rise to the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor. Developing it, he perfects discrimination.  

7  
With wisdom, he exerts unwavering energy, giving rise to the energy enlightenment factor. Perfecting it, he gains joy divorced from sensuality.  

8  
This joy leads to physical and mental tranquility, giving rise to the tranquility enlightenment factor.  

9  
Tranquil, he experiences pleasure, leading to concentration—the concentration enlightenment factor.  

10  
Concentrated, he observes the mind, giving rise to equanimity—the equanimity enlightenment factor.  

11-12  
By cultivating these seven factors, one can expect seven fruits and benefits:  

13  
(1) Liberation in this life. (2) If not in this life, then at death.  

14  
(3) If not then, becoming a once-returner. (4) If not, becoming a non-returner.  

15  
(5) If not, attaining arahantship without effort. (6) If not, with effort.  

17  
(7) If none of these, reborn in the pure abodes and reaching the summit of existence.  

19  
Thus, cultivating the seven factors leads to these seven fruits."  

1.4. Fourth: Mastery  

1  
Once, Venerable Sariputta was staying at Savatthi, Jeta's Grove.  

2  
He addressed the monks: "Friends, there are seven enlightenment factors: mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity.  

3  
I dwell in whichever factor I wish—morning, noon, or evening.  

4  
If mindfulness arises, I know it arises, persists, and ceases. The same applies to all seven factors.  

12  
Just as a king’s minister wears robes of any color he wishes at any time, so too I dwell in any enlightenment factor as needed."  

1.5. Fifth: The Monk  

2  
A monk asked the Buddha: "Venerable Sir, why are they called enlightenment factors?"  

3  
"Because they lead to enlightenment. A monk cultivating these seven factors becomes liberated from the taints, knowing birth is destroyed, the holy life fulfilled, the task done, no rebirth."  

1.6. Sixth: Kundaliya  

2  
The wanderer Kundaliya asked the Buddha: "What qualities do you dwell in?"  

3  
"The Tathagata dwells in the fruit of true knowledge and liberation."  

4-17  
Through questions, the Buddha explains the path from sense restraint to threefold good conduct, four establishments of mindfulness, seven enlightenment factors, culminating in liberation.  

18  
Kundaliya, inspired, takes refuge.  

1.7. Seventh: The Roof  

3  
"Just as all rafters of a peaked roof lead to the roof’s summit, so too do the seven factors lead to Nibbana."  

1.8. Eighth: Upali  

2  
Venerable Sariputta asked Upali: "How does a monk know the seven factors lead to blissful living?"  

3  
By knowing each factor’s arising and perfecting mental freedom, diligence, and effort.  

1.9. Ninth: Arising (1)  

3  
Cultivating the seven factors leads to their arising, except when a Tathagata does not appear.  

1.10. Tenth: Arising (2)  

3  
Similarly, these factors arise unless the Tathagata is absent.
