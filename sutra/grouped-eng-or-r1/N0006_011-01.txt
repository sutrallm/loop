1. Chapter 1: Sakka  

1.1 1. Subrahma  

1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.  

2. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!” Those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir!”  

3. The Blessed One said this:  

4. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, the Asuras attacked the devas. Bhikkhus! Then Sakka, lord of the devas, addressed the young deva Subrahma: ‘Dear son Subrahma! Now these Asuras are attacking the devas. Dear son Subrahma! Go forth and confront the Asuras.’ Bhikkhus! The young deva Subrahma replied to Sakka: ‘Yes, venerable sir,’ yet he indulged in heedlessness.  

5. Bhikkhus! ... Again ...  

6. Bhikkhus! A third time, Sakka addressed the young deva Subrahma: ‘Dear son Subrahma! These Asuras are now attacking the devas. Dear son Subrahma! Go forth and confront the Asuras.’ Bhikkhus! The young deva Subrahma replied to Sakka: ‘Yes, venerable sir,’ yet he indulged in heedlessness.  

7. Bhikkhus! Then Sakka spoke this verse to the young deva Subrahma:  
‘Without effort or striving,  
One who reaches the place of happiness—  
Subrahma, go there,  
And I too will go to that place.’  

8. [Subrahma:] ‘Lazy, without effort,  
Not doing what should be done,  
While enjoying all sensual pleasures,  
Show me the highest state.’  

9. [Sakka:] ‘Lazy, without striving,  
One who gains unlimited joy—  
Subrahma, go there,  
And I too will go to that place.’  

10. [Subrahma:] ‘O Sakka, lord of devas,  
What use is action for one in despair?  
For one who finds the path to happiness,  
Reveal the supreme path.’  

11. [Sakka:] ‘If nothing whatsoever is done,  
No aging would occur.  
This is indeed the path to Nibbāna—  
Subrahma, go there,  
And I too will go to that place.’  

12. Bhikkhus! Indeed, Sakka, through his own merit and wholesome deeds, rules over the Tāvatiṃsa devas. He should be praised as diligent and energetic. Bhikkhus! You have gone forth in this well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline. Strive earnestly, exert yourselves, and apply energy so that the unattained may be attained, the unreached may be reached, the unaccomplished may be accomplished. Thus you will illuminate this teaching.”  

1.2 2. Susīma  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.  

2. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!” Those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir!”  

3. The Blessed One said this:  

4. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, the Asuras attacked the devas. Bhikkhus! Then Sakka, lord of the devas, addressed the young deva Susīma: ‘Dear son Susīma! These Asuras are now attacking the devas. Dear son Susīma! Go forth and confront the Asuras.’ The young deva Susīma replied to Sakka: ‘Yes, venerable sir,’ yet he indulged in heedlessness.  

5. Bhikkhus! ... Again ...  

6. Bhikkhus! A third time, Sakka addressed the young deva Susīma: ‘Dear son Susīma! These Asuras are now attacking the devas. Dear son Susīma! Go forth and confront the Asuras.’ Bhikkhus! The young deva Susīma replied to Sakka: ‘Yes, venerable sir,’ yet he indulged in heedlessness.  

7. Bhikkhus! Then Sakka spoke this verse to the young deva Susīma:  
‘Without effort or striving,  
One who reaches the place of happiness—  
Susīma, go there,  
And I too will go to that place.’  

8. [Susīma:] ‘Lazy, without striving,  
Not doing what should be done,  
While enjoying all sensual pleasures,  
Show me the highest state.’  

9. [Sakka:] ‘Lazy, without striving,  
One who gains unlimited joy—  
Susīma, go there,  
And I too will go to that place.’  

10. [Susīma:] ‘O Sakka, lord of devas,  
What use is action for one in despair?  
For one who finds the path to happiness,  
Reveal the supreme path.’  

11. [Sakka:] ‘If nothing whatsoever is done,  
No aging would occur.  
This is indeed the path to Nibbāna—  
Susīma, go there,  
And I too will go to that place.’  

12. Bhikkhus! Indeed, Sakka, through his own merit and wholesome deeds, rules over the Tāvatiṃsa devas. He should be praised as diligent and energetic. Bhikkhus! You have gone forth in this well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline. Strive earnestly, exert yourselves, and apply energy so that the unattained may be attained, the unreached may be reached, the unaccomplished may be accomplished. Thus you will illuminate this teaching.”  

1.3 3. The Banner Crest  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.  

2. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!” The bhikkhus replied: “Venerable sir!”  

3. The Blessed One said this:  

4. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, the devas and Asuras waged war.  

5. Bhikkhus! Then Sakka addressed the Tāvatiṃsa devas: ‘Friends! Should fear, terror, or hair-raising horror arise when approaching the devas’ battlefront, look up at the crest of my banner. If you look at the crest of my banner, your fear, terror, or hair-raising horror will disappear.  

6. If you do not look at my banner’s crest, then look at the crest of Pajāpati’s banner. If you look at his banner’s crest, your fear, terror, or hair-raising horror will disappear.  

7. If you do not look at Pajāpati’s banner’s crest, look at Varuṇa’s banner’s crest...  

8. If you do not look at Varuṇa’s banner’s crest, look at Īsāna’s banner’s crest. If you look at his banner’s crest, your fear, terror, or hair-raising horror will disappear.’  

9. Bhikkhus! If one looked at Sakka’s, Pajāpati’s, Varuṇa’s, or Īsāna’s banner’s crest, it might eliminate fear. But for some, it might not.  

10. Why? Because Sakka was not free from lust, hatred, or delusion. He was cowardly, terrified, fearful, and prone to fleeing.  

11. Bhikkhus! But I say this: ‘If, while dwelling in the forest, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty hut, fear, terror, or hair-raising horror arises, then recollect me: “The Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.”’  

12. Bhikkhus! If you recollect me, that fear, terror, or hair-raising horror will vanish.  

13. If you do not recollect me, then recollect the Dhamma: ‘The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting investigation, applicable, to be personally realized by the wise.’  

14. Bhikkhus! If you recollect the Dhamma, that fear will vanish.  

15. If you do not recollect the Dhamma, then recollect the Sangha: ‘The Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practicing the good way, the straight way, the true way, the proper way. These are the four pairs, the eight individuals. This Sangha is worthy of gifts, hospitality, offerings, and respect—the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’  

16. Bhikkhus! If you recollect the Sangha, that fear will vanish.  

17. Why? Because the Tathāgata is free from lust, hatred, and delusion. He is fearless, dauntless, unafraid, and beyond fleeing.”  

18. The Blessed One spoke thus. The Well-Gone One then added:  

“Whether in forest or at tree’s foot,  
Or in secluded dwellings,  
O bhikkhus, recollect the Buddha—  
Then no fear shall arise.  

If you do not recollect the Buddha,  
The supreme person in the world,  
Then recollect the Dhamma,  
Leading to Nibbāna, well proclaimed.  

If you do not recollect the Dhamma,  
Leading to Nibbāna’s peace,  
Then recollect the Sangha,  
The unsurpassed field of merit.  

Thus, by recollecting Buddha, Dhamma,  
And Sangha, O bhikkhus,  
No fear or terror,  
Nor hair-raising horror, will remain.”  

1.4 4. Vepacitti (Patience)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove...  

2. The Blessed One said this:  

3. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, the devas and Asuras waged war.  

4. Bhikkhus! Then Vepacitti, king of the Asuras, commanded the Asuras: ‘Friends! If the Asuras defeat the devas in battle, bind Sakka with fivefold bonds and bring him before me in the Asura realm.’  

5. Bhikkhus! Sakka addressed the Tāvatiṃsa devas: ‘Friends! If the devas defeat the Asuras in battle, bind Vepacitti with fivefold bonds and bring him before me at the Hall of Justice.’  

6. Bhikkhus! In that battle, the devas won and the Asuras lost.  

7. Bhikkhus! Then the Tāvatiṃsa devas bound Vepacitti with fivefold bonds and brought him before Sakka in the Hall of Justice.  

8. Bhikkhus! Bound with fivefold bonds, Vepacitti entered and exited the Hall of Justice, hurling harsh insults at Sakka.  

9. Bhikkhus! Then Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:  
‘When Vepacitti hurls abuse,  
Do you endure out of fear, Sakka?  
Or from weakness do you not strike back?’  

10. [Sakka:] ‘I endure Vepacitti  
Not from weakness or fear.  
How can a wise one  
Stoop to fight a fool?’  

11. [Mātali:] ‘Fools will only grow worse  
If no one checks them.  
Thus, the wise restrain the fool  
With forceful punishment.’  

12. [Sakka:] ‘This is how I check fools:  
Knowing their anger,  
One remains mindful and calm.  

13. [Mātali:] ‘But, Sakka, this patience of yours  
Seems flawed to me.  
When a fool thinks,  
"He tolerates me out of fear,"  
He’ll chase you like a bull that flees.  

14. [Sakka:] ‘Let him think so if he wishes.  
Among the highest blessings,  
None surpasses patience.  
Patience when strong restrains the weak,  
Always called the supreme patience.  
Patience of the weak is merely weakness.  
A fool’s strength is called weakness.  
But the strong, guarding Dhamma,  
Do not retaliate.  

To harm one who harms you  
Is worse than the original harm.  
Not harming in return  
Wins a twofold victory:  
For oneself and the other.  

Knowing the other’s anger,  
He stays mindful and calm.  
Healing both sides,  
He is a sage who knows the Dhamma.  
Only fools know not this.’  

15. Bhikkhus! Sakka, through his own merit, rules the Tāvatiṃsa devas. He is praised for patience and gentleness.  

16. Bhikkhus! You, having gone forth in this well-proclaimed Dhamma and Discipline, should practice patience and gentleness. Thus you will illuminate this teaching.”  

1.5 5. Victory Through Gentle Speech  

1. At Savatthi.  

2. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, the devas and Asuras waged war.  

3. Then Vepacitti the Asura said to Sakka: ‘Let victory go to one who speaks gently.’ And Sakka agreed.  

4. Bhikkhus! The assembly declared who spoke gently and who spoke harshly.  

5. Vepacitti said to Sakka: ‘Sakka, recite a verse.’  

6. Sakka replied: ‘Vepacitti, you were once a deva. You recite first.’  

7. Vepacitti recited:  
‘Fools grow worse if unchecked.  
Thus, the wise restrain them  
With forceful punishment.’  

8. The Asuras cheered; the devas were silent.  

9. Vepacitti said: ‘Now, Sakka, recite.’  

10. Sakka recited:  
‘This is how I check fools:  
Knowing their anger,  
One remains mindful and calm.’  

11. The devas cheered; the Asuras were silent.  

12. Sakka said: ‘Vepacitti, recite.’  

13. Vepacitti recited:  
‘Sakka, your patience seems flawed.  
If a fool thinks you’re afraid,  
He’ll chase you like a fleeing bull.’  

14. The Asuras cheered; the devas were silent.  

15. Sakka recited:  
‘Let him think so if he wishes.  
Among the highest blessings,  
Patience is supreme.  
The strong who harm not  
Win twofold victory.  

Knowing the other’s anger,  
He stays mindful and calm.  
Healing both sides,  
He is a sage who knows the Dhamma.’  

16. The devas cheered; the Asuras were silent.  

17. The assembly declared:  

18. ‘Vepacitti’s verses promote force, strife, conflict.  

19. Sakka’s verses reject conflict. Victory lies in gentle speech.’  

20. Thus, Sakka won by gentle speech.”  

1.6 6. The Bird’s Nest  

1. At Savatthi.  

2. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, the devas and Asuras waged war.  

3. The Asuras won; the devas fled north.  

4. The Asuras chased them.  

5. Sakka told Mātali: ‘Turn the chariot! Avoid harming the birds’ nests.’  

6. Mātali turned the thousand-horsed chariot.  

7. The Asuras thought: ‘Sakka returns to fight!’ They fled in fear.  

8. Thus, Sakka’s victory came through Dhamma.”  

1.7 7. No Deceit  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  

2. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, Sakka resolved: ‘Even toward enemies, I shall not deceive.’  

3. Vepacitti read his mind and approached.  

4. Sakka said: ‘Vepacitti! You are caught!’  

5. ‘Do not abandon your resolve.’  

6. ‘I vow not to deceive you.’  

7. [Vepacitti:] ‘False speech brings evil;  
Slandering the noble brings evil;  
Betraying friends brings evil;  
Ingratitude brings evil.  
Sakka, your vow guards against deceit.’  

1.8 8. Verocana  

1. At Savatthi.  

2. The Blessed One was in seclusion.  

3. Sakka and Verocana approached, standing by the door.  

4. Verocana recited:  
‘Strive till success is gained;  
Verocana declares:  
Glory comes through striving.’  

5. [Sakka:] ‘Strive till success is gained;  
But patience is supreme in triumph.  
Strength can’t surpass patience.’  

6. [Verocana:] ‘Among beings, striving suits each.  
As tastes vary with food,  
So glory comes through effort.’  

7. [Sakka:] ‘To each their own path,  
Yet patience is highest glory.  
Force meets weakness, but  
Patient strength guards Dhamma.’  

1.9 9. Scent of the Forest Ascetics  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  

2. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, virtuous ascetics dwelled in leaf huts in a forest.  

3. Sakka and Vepacitti visited them.  

4. Vepacitti entered with sword, shoes, and umbrella, insulting the ascetics.  

5. Sakka removed his shoes, gave his sword, lowered his umbrella, and stood humbly.  

6. The ascetics addressed Sakka:  
‘The scent of virtue pervades the winds.  
But you, thousand-eyed one, reek.  
Why do devas love this scent?’  

7. [Sakka:] ‘Like flower garlands,  
The scent of virtue delights us.  
We devas cherish it,  
Never tiring of its fragrance.’  

1.10 10. The Seashore Ascetics  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi...  

2. “Bhikkhus! Long ago, virtuous ascetics dwelled in leaf huts by the sea.  

3. The devas and Asuras waged war.  

4. The ascetics resolved: ‘We fear the Asuras. Let us seek safety from Saṃvara.’  

5. They vanished and reappeared before Saṃvara.  

6. The ascetics recited:  
‘We ascetics seek safety.  
Give us freedom from fear.’  

7. [Saṃvara:] ‘Serving Sakka, you’ll find fear.  
Begging safety, I grant terror.’  

8. [Ascetics:] ‘You return fear for safety.  
As seeds bear fruit,  
Evil brings evil.  
May endless fear haunt you!’  

9. The ascetics cursed Saṃvara and vanished.  

10. That night, Saṃvara awoke thrice in terror.”
