4. Great Discourse on the Ganges  
[33] 1.  
2. "Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges river flows towards the east, slopes towards the east, and descends towards the east, so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the Four Foundations of Spiritual Power flows towards nirvana, slopes towards nirvana, and descends towards nirvana.  

3. Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the Four Foundations of Spiritual Power flow towards nirvana, slope towards nirvana, and descend towards nirvana?  

4. Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu cultivates the foundation of spiritual power consisting of desire accompanied by concentration and volitional exertion. He cultivates the foundation of spiritual power consisting of energy accompanied by concentration and volitional exertion... the foundation of spiritual power consisting of mind accompanied by concentration and volitional exertion... the foundation of spiritual power consisting of investigation accompanied by concentration and volitional exertion.  

5. Bhikkhus, in this way, a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the Four Foundations of Spiritual Power flows towards nirvana, slopes towards nirvana, and descends towards nirvana."
