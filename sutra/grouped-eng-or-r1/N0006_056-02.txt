2. Turning the Wheel of Dharma  
[11] 1. The Tathagata's Teaching (1)  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Isipatana, the Deer Park near Baranasi.  
2. There, the Blessed One addressed the five bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, one who has gone forth should not indulge in these two extremes. What are the two extremes?  
3. (1) Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, vulgar, worldly, ignoble, and unbeneficial. (2) Pursuit of self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. Bhikkhus, the Tathagata, having abandoned both extremes, awakened to the Middle Path. This gives rise to vision, knowledge, peace, direct realization, enlightenment, and Nirvana.  
4. Bhikkhus, what is the Middle Path awakened to by the Tathagata? It is the Noble Eightfold Path: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. This is the Middle Path awakened to by the Tathagata, which gives rise to vision, knowledge, peace, direct realization, enlightenment, and Nirvana.  
5. Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of Suffering is this: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the loved is suffering; not getting what one desires is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.  
6. Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is this: craving that leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking pleasure here and there—that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.  
7. Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering is this: the remainderless fading away and cessation of that craving, giving it up, relinquishing it, releasing it, and letting go of it.  
8. Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering is this: the Noble Eightfold Path—Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.  
9. Bhikkhus, regarding the Noble Truth of Suffering: the eye arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose in me toward things unheard before. Bhikkhus, this Noble Truth of Suffering should be fully understood... having fully understood it, the eye arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose in me toward things unheard before.  
10. Bhikkhus, regarding the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering... Bhikkhus, this should be abandoned... having abandoned it...  
11. Bhikkhus, regarding the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering... Bhikkhus, this should be realized... having realized it...  
12. Bhikkhus, regarding the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering... Bhikkhus, this should be developed... having developed it...  
13. Bhikkhus, so long as my knowledge and vision of the Four Noble Truths as they truly are in their three phases and twelve aspects was not thoroughly purified, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, maras, brahmas, ascetics, brahmins, devas, and humans.  
14. Bhikkhus, when my knowledge and vision of the Four Noble Truths as they truly are in their three phases and twelve aspects was thoroughly purified, I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. Knowledge arose in me: 'My liberation is unshakable; this is my last birth; there is now no renewal of existence.'"  
15. When the Blessed One had spoken thus, the five bhikkhus rejoiced and approved his words. During this teaching, the Venerable Kondanna attained the dust-free, stainless eye of the Dharma: "Whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation."  
16. When the Blessed One set in motion the Wheel of Dharma, the earth-dwelling devas proclaimed: "At Baranasi, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, the unsurpassed Wheel of Dharma has been set in motion by the Blessed One, which cannot be stopped by any ascetic, brahmin, deva, mara, brahma, or anyone in the world."  
17. Hearing this, the devas of the Four Great Kings proclaimed the same.  
18. Hearing this, the Tavatimsa devas... the Yama devas... the Tusita devas... the Nimmanarati devas... the Paranimmitavasavatti devas... the Brahma-world devas proclaimed: "At Baranasi... cannot be stopped."  
19. Thus in that moment, in an instant, the sound spread as far as the Brahma-world. The ten-thousandfold world system shook and displayed a boundless radiance, surpassing the splendor of the devas.  
20. Then the Blessed One exclaimed: "Kondanna has understood! Kondanna has understood!" Hence, the Venerable Kondanna came to be known as Annata Kondanna.  

[12] 2. The Tathagata's Teaching (2)  
2. "Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of Suffering: the eye arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose in the Tathagata toward things unheard before. Bhikkhus, this should be fully understood... having fully understood it...  
3. Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering... this should be abandoned...  
4. Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering... this should be realized...  
5. Bhikkhus, the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering... this should be developed..."  

[13] 3. Aggregates  
2. "Bhikkhus, there are Four Noble Truths. What four? The Noble Truth of Suffering, Origin, Cessation, and Path.  
3. The Noble Truth of Suffering: the five aggregates subject to clinging—form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, consciousness.  
4. The Noble Truth of Origin: craving leading to rebirth...  
5. The Noble Truth of Cessation: the remainderless fading away of craving...  
6. The Noble Truth of Path: the Noble Eightfold Path...  
7. Therefore, bhikkhus, strive to understand suffering, abandon its origin, realize its cessation, and develop the path."  

[14] 4. Sense Bases  
2. "Bhikkhus, the Four Noble Truths...  
3. The Noble Truth of Suffering: the six sense bases—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.  
4. Origin: craving...  
5. Cessation: fading away of craving...  
6. Path: Eightfold Path...  
7. Strive accordingly."  

[15] 5. Acceptance (1)  
2. "Bhikkhus, have you accepted the Four Noble Truths I taught?"  
3. A bhikkhu replied: "Yes, Lord."  
4. "I accept suffering as the first truth, origin as the second, cessation as the third, path as the fourth."  
5. The Buddha affirmed this.  
6. "Thus, strive accordingly."  

[16] 6. Acceptance (2)  
2. The same question.  
3. A bhikkhu replied: "No ascetic or brahmin can deny these truths. I accept them."  
9. The Buddha praised him.  
10. "Strive accordingly."  

[17] 7. Ignorance  
2. A bhikkhu asked: "What is ignorance?"  
3. The Buddha said: "Ignorance is not knowing suffering, its origin, cessation, or path. Thus, strive."  

[18] 8. Knowledge  
2. A bhikkhu asked: "What is knowledge?"  
3. The Buddha said: "Knowledge is understanding the Four Truths. Thus, strive."  

[19] 9. Eloquence  
2. "Bhikkhus, the Four Truths I teach contain immeasurable meaning, wording, and eloquence. Thus, strive."  

[20] 10. Thusness  
2. "Bhikkhus, four things are thus, not otherwise: suffering, origin, cessation, path. Strive accordingly."
