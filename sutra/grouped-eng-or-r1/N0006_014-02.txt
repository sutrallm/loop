2. The Chapter on Shamelessness

2.1. The First on These Seven

1. The Blessed One was staying at Savatthi.

2. The Blessed One said: "Monks, there are these seven realms. What seven? The realm of radiance, the realm of purity, the realm of the base of infinite space, the realm of the base of infinite consciousness, the realm of the base of nothingness, the realm of the base of neither perception nor non-perception, and the realm of the cessation of perception and feeling. These, monks, are the seven realms."

3. When this was said, a monk addressed the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, these realms—the realm of radiance, purity, infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception, and the cessation of perception and feeling—by what, venerable sir, are these realms known?"

4. "Monk, the realm of radiance is known through darkness.

5. The realm of purity is known through impurity.

6. The realm of infinite space is known through form.

7. The realm of infinite consciousness is known through the base of infinite space.

8. The realm of nothingness is known through the base of infinite consciousness.

9. The realm of neither perception nor non-perception is known through the base of nothingness.

10. The realm of the cessation of perception and feeling is known through cessation."

11. "Venerable sir, how are these realms—radiance, purity, infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception, and the cessation of perception and feeling—attained?"

12. "Monk, the realms of radiance, purity, infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness are attained through the attainment of perception.

13. The realm of neither perception nor non-perception is attained through the attainment with a residue of formations.

14. The realm of the cessation of perception and feeling is attained through the attainment of cessation."

2.2. The Second with Cause

1. The Blessed One was staying at Savatthi.

2. The Blessed One said: "Monks, sensual thoughts arise with a cause, not without cause. Ill-willed thoughts arise with a cause, not without cause. Harmful thoughts arise with a cause, not without cause.

3. What is the cause for the arising of sensual thoughts? For ill-willed thoughts? For harmful thoughts?

4. The sensual element: from contact with the sensual realm arises sensual perception, from sensual perception arises sensual thought, from sensual thought arises sensual desire, from desire arises sensual passion, from passion arises sensual craving. Unlearned ordinary persons, monks, seek sensual cravings and thus engage wrongly in body, speech, and mind.

5. The element of ill-will: from contact with the hateful realm arises hateful perception, leading to hateful thought, desire, passion, and craving. Unlearned ordinary persons seek such cravings and engage wrongly in three ways.

6. The harmful element: from contact with the harmful realm arises harmful perception, leading to harmful thought, desire, passion, and craving. Unlearned ordinary persons seek such cravings and engage wrongly.

7. Suppose a person tosses a flaming grass torch into a dry field. If not quickly stamped out, monks, all creatures dependent on grass and trees would meet disaster.

8. Similarly, any ascetic or brahmin who allows unwholesome thoughts to arise and does not abandon, dispel, destroy, or eliminate them will dwell in suffering here and now, meet destruction, affliction, and distress, and after death, face a bad destination.

9. Monks, thoughts of renunciation arise with a cause, not without cause. Thoughts of non-ill-will arise with a cause, not without cause. Thoughts of harmlessness arise with a cause, not without cause.

10. What is the cause for these wholesome thoughts?

11. The renunciation element: from contact with the renunciate realm arises perception of renunciation, leading to thought, desire, passion, and craving. Learned noble disciples seek renunciate cravings and engage rightly in three ways.

12. The non-ill-will element: from contact arises perception of non-ill-will, leading to thought, desire, passion, and craving. Noble disciples seek such cravings and engage rightly.

13. The non-harmful element: from contact arises perception of harmlessness, leading to thought, desire, passion, and craving. Noble disciples seek such cravings and engage rightly.

14. Suppose a person tosses a flaming torch into a dry field but quickly stamps it out. All creatures would be spared disaster.

15. Similarly, any ascetic or brahmin who abandons unwholesome thoughts quickly will dwell in happiness here and now, free from destruction, affliction, and distress, and after death, reach a good destination."

2.3. The Third at Brick House

1. The Blessed One was staying at the brick house in Nadika.

2. The Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, perceptions, views, and cognitions arise in dependence on elements."

3. The venerable Kaccana then asked: "How is the view of the Unawakened and the Awakened known?"

4. "Kaccana, this great element is the element of ignorance."

5. "I declare that based on inferior elements emerge inferior perceptions, views, thoughts, aspirations, speeches, and actions. Such a person declares, teaches, and displays inferior things, leading to an inferior rebirth.

6. Based on middling elements arise middling perceptions, views, thoughts, speeches, and actions. Such a person expounds middling things, leading to a middling rebirth.

7. Based on superior elements arise superior perceptions, views, thoughts, speeches, and actions. Such a person expounds superior things, leading to a superior rebirth."

2.4. The Fourth on Inferior Resolve

1. The Blessed One was staying at Savatthi.

2. The Blessed One said: "Monks, beings are connected and united by their elements. Those of inferior resolve are connected with inferior resolve; those of superior resolve with superior resolve.

3. In the past, beings were connected and united by their elements; the inferior with the inferior, the superior with the superior.

4. In the future, beings will be connected and united by their elements; the inferior with the inferior, the superior with the superior.

5. In the present, beings are connected and united by their elements; the inferior with the inferior, the superior with the superior."

2.5. The Fifth on Karma

1. The Blessed One was staying at Vulture Peak in Rajagaha.

2. Venerable Sariputta was walking nearby with many monks. Similarly, Maha Moggallana, Maha Kassapa, Anuruddha, Punna Mantaniputta, Upali, Ananda, and Devadatta each walked with their followers.

3. The Blessed One remarked: "See Sariputta and his followers—all possess great wisdom. Moggallana and his—great psychic power. Kassapa and his—ascetic practices. Anuruddha and his—divine eye. Punna and his—skill in teaching. Upali and his—mastery of discipline. Ananda and his—vast learning. Devadatta and his—evil conduct.

18-21. As beings are connected and united by their elements in past, future, and present, the inferior with the inferior and the superior with the superior."

2.6. The Sixth with Verses

1-5. The Blessed One elaborated on beings connected by elements, likening the inferior to dung, urine, pus, and blood mingling; the superior to milk, oil, ghee, and honey uniting.

6. He then spoke verses: "Descended into lust, bound by contact, like a small boat on the sea, the negligent sink. But the wise, striving diligently, united with the noble, abide in constant effort."

2.7. The Seventh on Faithlessness

1-7. Beings united by faithlessness, shamelessness, recklessness, ignorance, laziness, heedlessness, and wrong views; or by faith, shame, moral dread, learning, effort, mindfulness, and wisdom—in past, future, and present.

2.8. The Eighth on Five Roots of Faithlessness

Expanding the same theme in five pairs across past, future, and present.

2.9. The Ninth on Shamelessness' Four Roots

Elaborating shamelessness linked with related defilements and their counterparts.

2.10. The Tenth on Recklessness' Three Roots

Similarly analyzing recklessness and its antidotes.

2.11. The Eleventh on Ignorance

Continuing the pattern with ignorance and wisdom in dual aspects.

2.12. The Twelfth on Laziness

Concluding with laziness linked to heedlessness and countered by effort.

The chapter closes with verses: "These seven with cause, the brick house, inferior resolve, karma, verses, faithlessness seven, five roots, four on shamelessness, three on recklessness, two on ignorance, and one on laziness—twenty-two suttas complete the second chapter."
