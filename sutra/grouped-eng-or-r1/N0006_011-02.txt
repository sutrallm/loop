Chapter 2. The Section on Emperor Shakra  

2.1. The Devas (The Precept Pillars) (1)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...]  

2. “Monks, when Emperor Shakra was a human, he perfectly upheld seven precept pillars. Because of upholding these, Emperor Shakra attained the status of Emperor Shakra.  

3. What are the seven precept pillars?  

4. He supported and honored his parents throughout his life. He respected the elders of his household throughout his life. He spoke gently throughout his life. He avoided slander throughout his life. Throughout his life, his mind dwelled free from the stain of miserliness, generously giving, delighting in sharing, responding to those in need, and joyfully distributing gifts. He spoke truthfully throughout his life. He was free from anger throughout his life, and if anger arose, he swiftly restrained it.  

5. Monks, when Emperor Shakra was a human, he perfectly upheld these seven precept pillars. By upholding these, he attained the status of Emperor Shakra.”  

6. [After the Blessed One had spoken... the Teacher further said this verse:]  
One who supports parents, serves the elders,  
Speaks gentle words, refrains from slander,  
Abandons miserliness, speaks truth, restrains wrath—  
The righteous gods call such a person virtuous.  

2.2. The Devas (2)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi at Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park...]  

2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks:  

3. “Monks, in the past when Emperor Shakra was a human, he was named the Youth Magha. Thus, he is now called Maghava.  

4. Monks, in the past when Emperor Shakra was a human, he gave gifts in every street. Thus, he is called Purindada (‘Giver in the Streets’).  

5. Monks, in the past when Emperor Shakra was a human, he gave respectfully. Thus, he is called Sakka.  

6. Monks, in the past when Emperor Shakra was a human, he provided dwellings. Thus, he is called Vasava.  

7. Monks, in the past when Emperor Shakra was a human, he could ponder a thousand matters in a single moment. Thus, he is called the Thousand-eyed One.  

8. Monks, Emperor Shakra is called Suja’s Husband because he has Suja, the Asura maiden, as his wife.  

9. Monks, Emperor Shakra is called Lord of the Gods because he rules as sovereign over the Thirty-three Gods.”  

10-12. [As in the previous sutta’s sections 2-5.]  

2.3. The Devas (3)  

1. Thus have I heard. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling in the Great Forest near Vesali, in the Gabled Hall.  

2. Then Mahali of the Licchavis approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and sat to one side.  

3. Sitting to one side, Mahali said to the Blessed One: “Venerable Sir, have you seen Emperor Shakra?”  

4. “Mahali, I have seen Emperor Shakra.”  

5. “Venerable Sir, surely it was someone resembling Emperor Shakra? Emperor Shakra is difficult to meet.”  

6. “Mahali, I know Emperor Shakra, and I know the qualities that make him Emperor Shakra, as well as the causes and principles by which he became Emperor Shakra.”  

7-18. [As in the previous sutta’s sections 3-12.]  

2.4. The Poor Man  

1. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.  

2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!”  

3. “Yes, Venerable Sir,” they replied.  

4. The Blessed One said:  

5. “Monks, in this city of Rajagaha, there was a poor, pitiable man.  

6. He possessed faith in the Dhamma and Vinaya taught by the Tathagata. He was virtuous, learned, generous, and wise.  

7. Having these qualities, after death, he was reborn among the Thirty-three Gods, in a happy realm. His complexion and radiance surpassed those of other gods.  

8. The gods of Tavatimsa complained: ‘It is astounding! How could this god—once a poor, wretched man—now surpass us in splendor?’  

9. Emperor Shakra addressed them: ‘Friends, do not disparage him. In his human life, he possessed faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Thus, he now outshines you.’  

10. Then Emperor Shakra consoled them, reciting:  

The Tathagata is unshaken. With steadfast faith,  
One who delights in the Noble Ones’ virtue,  
Who trusts the Sangha, whose view is straight—  
He is not poor. His life is fruitful.  
Therefore, wise ones should follow  
The Buddha’s Teaching, cultivating faith, virtue, and wisdom.”  

2.5. The Pleasant  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi at Jeta’s Grove...]  

2. Then Emperor Shakra approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and stood to one side.  

3. Standing there, he asked: “Venerable Sir, where is a pleasant land?”  

4. [The Blessed One:] Gardens with lotus ponds,  
Lovely and delightful to people—  
These are not worth a sixteenth part  
Of where the Arahants dwell.  
Whether in village or forest,  
On dry land or by water—  
Wherever the Arahants dwell:  
That is the pleasant land.  

2.6. The Sacrificer  

1. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha, on Vulture Peak.  

2. Then Emperor Shakra approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and stood to one side.  

3. Standing there, he recited:  

People seek merit through sacrifice.  
Those who perform rites for future gain—  
What offering yields the highest fruit?  

4. [The Blessed One:] The fourfold path with its fruits,  
Right view, the Sangha of wisdom, virtue,  
And concentration—sacrifices to them  
Yield the highest fruit for seekers of merit.  

2.7. Homage  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi at Jeta’s Grove...]  

2. Then the Blessed One entered seclusion for midday meditation.  

3. Emperor Shakra, Brahma, and Sahampati approached, standing by the door.  

4. Emperor Shakra recited to the Blessed One:  

Rise, O Hero, victorious in battle!  
Unburdened, debt-free one!  
Your mind is perfectly liberated,  
Like the moon on the fifteenth night.  

5. “Lord of Gods, this is not how one honors the Tathagata.”  

Hero, victor in battle, leader of caravans,  
Debt-free one, teach the Dhamma!  
Some will understand.  

2.8. Emperor Shakra’s Homage (1)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...]  

2. The Blessed One said:  

3. “Monks, long ago, Emperor Shakra told his charioteer Matali: ‘Prepare the chariot with a thousand horses! I will go to admire the gardens.’  

4. Matali harnessed the chariot and said: ‘Sire, it is ready.’  

5. Emperor Shakra descended from Vejayanta Palace, paid homage to the four directions.  

6. Matali asked in verse:  

The wise, earthly kings,  
The Four Great Kings, the gods of Tavatimsa—  
All honor you. Whom do you honor?  

7. [Emperor Shakra:] I honor those upright in virtue,  
Calm in mind, truthful renunciants,  
Lay devotees living dutifully,  
Supporting families righteously.  

8. [Matali:] You honor the best in the world.  
I too honor whom you honor.  

9. Thus, Emperor Shakra paid homage first, then mounted the chariot.  

2.9. Emperor Shakra’s Homage (2)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...]  

2. “Monks, long ago, Emperor Shakra ordered Matali: ‘Prepare the chariot to visit the gardens.’  

3. Matali readied it and said: ‘Sire, it is done.’  

4. Emperor Shakra descended and paid homage to the Blessed One.  

5. Matali asked: Whom do you honor, sire?  

6. [Emperor Shakra:] I honor the Tathagata,  
The Supreme One, destroyer of greed,  
Hatred, and delusion, the Arahant.  
Honor those training diligently,  
Who have overcome the defilements.  

7. [Matali:] You honor the supreme one.  
I too honor him. Thus, they departed.  

2.10. Emperor Shakra’s Homage (3)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...]  

2. The Blessed One said:  

3. “Monks, long ago, Emperor Shakra told Matali: ‘Prepare the chariot.’  

4. Matali complied.  

5. Emperor Shakra paid homage to the Sangha.  

6. Matali questioned: These ascetics living off scraps,  
Bodies soiled—why honor them?  

7. [Emperor Shakra:] They wander free from craving,  
Owning nothing, content with alms,  
Speaking truth, serene in heart.  
Ordinary folk fight and hate,  
But these remain peaceful, weaponless.  
Thus, I honor them.  

8. [Matali:] You honor the best. I too honor them.  

Summary:  
Three sections on the Devas, the Poor Man,  
The Pleasant, Sacrificer, Homage,  
And three on Emperor Shakra’s Homage.
