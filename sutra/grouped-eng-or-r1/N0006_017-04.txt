4. Bhikkhus, just as a plantain tree perishes by bearing fruit—for its own ruin, it bears fruit and perishes. So too, for his own ruin, Devadatta conceived gain, offerings, and fame; Devadatta perishes due to conceiving gain, offerings, and fame.  

5. Just as bamboo perishes by bearing fruit—for its own ruin, it bears fruit and perishes. So too, Devadatta...  

6. Just as a reed perishes by bearing fruit—for its own ruin, it bears fruit and perishes. So too, Devadatta...
