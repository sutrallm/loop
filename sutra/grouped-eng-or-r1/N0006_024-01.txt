1. First Chapter: The Stream-Enterer Section (1. Sotāpattivaggo)

1.1 First: Wind  
1.1-2  
At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī... "Bhikkhus, due to what, grasping what, infatuated with what, does such a view arise: 'The wind does not blow; rivers do not flow; a woman with child does not give birth; the sun and moon rise but do not set; they stand fixed like a pillar'?"  

3  
"Venerable sir, the Blessed One is the root of the Dhamma... (as before)..."  

4  
"Bhikkhus, there is form. By grasping form, infatuated with form, such a view arises: 'The wind does not blow... they stand fixed like a pillar.'  

5-7  
Feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

8  
There is consciousness. By grasping consciousness, infatuated with consciousness, such a view arises: 'The wind does not blow... they stand fixed like a pillar.'  

9  
"Bhikkhus, what do you think? Is form permanent or impermanent?"  
"Venerable sir, it is impermanent."  
"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"  
"Venerable sir, it is suffering."  
"Without grasping what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could such a view arise: 'The wind does not blow... they stand fixed like a pillar'?"  
"Venerable sir, it could not."  

10-12  
Feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

13  
"Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?"  
"Venerable sir, it is impermanent."  
"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"  
"Venerable sir, it is suffering."  
"Without grasping what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could such a view arise: 'The wind does not blow... they stand fixed like a pillar'?"  
"Venerable sir, it could not."  

14  
"Is what is seen, heard, sensed, known, attained, sought after, and pondered by the mind permanent or impermanent?"  
"Venerable sir, it is impermanent."  
"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"  
"Venerable sir, it is suffering."  
"Without grasping what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could such a view arise: 'The wind does not blow... they stand fixed like a pillar'?"  
"Venerable sir, it could not."  

15  
"Bhikkhus, when a noble disciple has abandoned doubt regarding these six bases, regarding suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering—such a noble disciple is called a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the lower realms, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination."  

(Following sections 2-18 follow the same structure, with variations in the core views addressed, such as "This is mine, this I am, this is my self," "The world is eternal," "The world is finite," "The Tathāgata exists after death," etc. Each concludes similarly by refuting attachment to the aggregates and affirming the stream-enterer’s realization.)  

18.18 Non-Existence and Non-Non-Existence  
1-2  
At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī... "Bhikkhus, due to what, grasping what, infatuated with what, does such a view arise: 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"  

3  
"Venerable sir, the Blessed One is the root of the Dhamma..."  

4-8  
"Bhikkhus, there is form... consciousness. By grasping it, infatuated with it, such a view arises: 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'  

9  
"Bhikkhus, what do you think? Is form permanent or impermanent?"  
"Venerable sir, it is impermanent..."  
"Without grasping what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, could such a view arise: 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"  
"Venerable sir, it could not."  

10-13
