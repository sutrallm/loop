1. First Chapter  
[1] 1. Mara  
1. [Thus have I heard:] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi... and so on.  
2. Then the Venerable Radha approached the Blessed One’s residence. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.  
3. Having sat to one side, the Venerable Radha said to the Blessed One:  
“Venerable sir, it is said: ‘Mara, Mara.’ What is Mara?”  
4. “Radha, where there is form, there is Mara, the killer, death. Radha, therefore, one should regard form as Mara, as the killer, as death, as disease, as a boil, as a thorn, as suffering, as the root of suffering. To regard thus is right regard.  
5.–7. Feeling... Perception... Volitional formations...  
8. Where there is consciousness, there is Mara, the killer, death. Radha, therefore, one should regard consciousness as Mara... as the root of suffering. To regard thus is right regard.”  
9. “Venerable sir, what is right regard?”  
“Radha, right regard is for the sake of disenchantment.”  
10. “Venerable sir, what is disenchantment?”  
“Radha, disenchantment is for the sake of dispassion.”  
11. “Venerable sir, what is dispassion?”  
“Radha, dispassion is for the sake of liberation.”  
12. “Venerable sir, what is liberation?”  
“Radha, liberation is for the sake of Nirvana.”  
13. “Venerable sir, what is Nirvana?”  
“Radha, this question goes too far. One cannot grasp Nirvana’s boundaries. Radha, for one established in the holy life, Nirvana is the destination, the culmination of the holy life.”  

[2] 2. Beings  
1.–2. [Thus have I heard:] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi... and so on.  
3. Having sat to one side, the Venerable Radha said to the Blessed One:  
“Venerable sir, it is said: ‘a being, a being.’ How is one called a being?”  
4. “Radha, when there is desire, greed, delight, craving for form, clinging to it, entanglement in it, then one is called a being.  
5.–7. Feeling... Perception... Volitional formations...  
8. When there is desire, greed, delight, craving for consciousness, clinging to it, entanglement in it, then one is called a being.  
9. Radha, just as children build sand castles. As long as they are not free from lust, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, or craving for those sand castles, they cherish, treasure, and cling to them.  
10. But when those children lose lust, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, and craving for the sand castles, they scatter, demolish, and abandon them.  
11.–14. Radha, likewise, you should scatter, demolish, and abandon form... feeling... perception... volitional formations...  
15. Scatter, demolish, and abandon consciousness for the destruction of craving. Radha, the destruction of craving is Nirvana.”  

[3] 3. The Net of Existence  
1.–2. [Thus have I heard:] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi... and so on.  
3. Having sat to one side, the Venerable Radha said to the Blessed One:  
“Venerable sir, what is the net of existence? What is its cessation?”  
4. “Radha, desire, greed, delight, craving, grasping, mental clinging, attachment, and latent tendencies toward form: this is called the net of existence. Its cessation is the cessation of the net of existence.  
5.–7. Feeling... Perception... Volitional formations...  
8. Desire... latent tendencies toward consciousness: this is called the net of existence. Its cessation is the cessation of the net of existence.”  

[4] 4. The Fully Understood  
1.–2. [Thus have I heard:] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi... and so on.  
3. While seated, the Blessed One said to the Venerable Radha:  
“Radha, I will teach you what is to be fully understood, full understanding, and the one who has fully understood. Listen.”  
4. “Yes, venerable sir.”  
“Radha, form is to be fully understood. Feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness is to be fully understood. This is called ‘what is to be fully understood.’  
5. What is full understanding? The destruction of greed, hatred, and delusion. This is called ‘full understanding.’  
6. Who is the one who has fully understood? He is called a perfected one, named so-and-so of such-and-such clan. This is called ‘the one who has fully understood.’”  

[5] 5. Ascetics (1)  
1.–3. [Thus have I heard:] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi... and so on.  
4. “Radha, there are five aggregates subject to clinging: the form aggregate... up to the consciousness aggregate.  
5. Radha, any ascetics or Brahmins who do not truly understand these aggregates’ gratification, danger, and escape—I do not acknowledge them as true ascetics or Brahmins. They do not realize the goal of asceticism or Brahminhood in this very life.  
6. But any ascetics or Brahmins who do truly understand these aggregates’ gratification, danger, and escape—I acknowledge them as true ascetics or Brahmins. They realize the goal of asceticism or Brahminhood in this very life.”

4. “Radha, there are five aggregates subject to clinging...

4. “Radha, there are five aggregates subject to clinging...

[8] 8. The Perfected One  
1.–3. [Thus have I heard:] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi... and so on.  
4. “Radha, there are five aggregates subject to clinging...  
5. A monk who truly understands these aggregates’ origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape, and is liberated through non-clinging, is called a perfected one—one whose taints are destroyed, who has completed the spiritual journey, laid down the burden, attained the goal, utterly destroyed the fetters, and is fully liberated.”  

[9] 9. Desire (1)  
1.–3. [Thus have I heard:] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi... and so on.  
4. “Radha, cut off desire, greed, delight, and craving for form. When form is cut off, like a palm tree severed at the root, it is made non-existent and unable to arise again.  
5.–7. Cut off desire... for feeling... perception... volitional formations...  
8. Cut off desire... for consciousness. When consciousness is cut off... it is made non-existent and unable to arise again.”
