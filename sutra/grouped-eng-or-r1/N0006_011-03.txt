3. Sakka Chapter  

21. The First on Killing  

1. [Thus have I heard.] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapiṇḍika's Park.  

2. Then Sakka, the lord of gods, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.  

3. Standing to one side, Sakka addressed the Blessed One in verse:  

"Killing what does one sleep blissfully? Killing what does one not grieve? What is the one thing, O Gotama, whose killing you approve?"  

4. [The Blessed One:] "Killing anger, one sleeps blissfully. Killing anger, one does not grieve. O Sakka, the killing of anger, with its poisoned root and honeyed tip—this the noble ones praise. Having killed anger, one does not grieve."  

22. The Second on Ugliness  

1. [Thus have I heard.] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapiṇḍika's Park.  

2. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:  

3. "Bhikkhus, in the distant past, an ugly, dwarfed yakkha sat upon the throne of Sakka, the lord of gods."  

4. "Bhikkhus, then the Tavatimsa devas grumbled, complained, and murmured: 'How strange, how astonishing! This ugly, dwarfed yakkha sits upon Sakka’s throne!'  

5. Bhikkhus, as the Tavatimsa devas grumbled and complained, that yakkha became handsome, radiant, and majestic.  

6. Bhikkhus, then the Tavatimsa devas approached Sakka and said to him:  

7. 'Venerable sir, an ugly, dwarfed yakkha sits upon your throne. Therefore, the Tavatimsa devas grumble and complain. Venerable sir, when they grumbled, that yakkha became handsome. Could he be the Anger-Eater Yakkha?'  

8. Bhikkhus, then Sakka went to the Anger-Eater Yakkha. Arriving, he draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms, and three times announced his name: 'Venerable sir, I am Sakka, lord of gods! Venerable sir, I am Sakka, lord of gods!'  

9. Bhikkhus, as Sakka announced his name, that yakkha became ugly and dwarfed again. Having become ugly and dwarfed, he disappeared.  

10. Bhikkhus, then Sakka sat upon his throne and admonished the Tavatimsa devas with this verse:  

'My mind is not easily shaken, nor overcome by emotion. I harbor no anger long. In me, rage does not arise. I do not speak harsh words. My speech is ever truthful. Self-controlled for my own good, I constantly restrain myself.'"  

23. The Third on Illusion  

1. [Thus have I heard.] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi.  

2. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:  

3. "Bhikkhus, in the distant past, Vepacitti, the lord of the Asuras, was afflicted by a severe illness.  

4. Bhikkhus, then Sakka went to visit Vepacitti.  

5. Bhikkhus, seeing Sakka approach, Vepacitti said: 'Heal me, lord of gods!'  

6. 'Vepacitti, teach me the illusion of Sambara.'  

7. 'Friend, I must consult the Asuras.'  

8. Bhikkhus, then Vepacitti addressed the Asuras: 'Should I teach Sakka the illusion of Sambara?'  

9. 'No! Do not teach him!'  

10. Bhikkhus, then Vepacitti addressed Sakka in verse:  

'Maghavā, Sakka, lord of gods, the illusion leads to hell. Therefore, Sambara’s art condemns its master to a hundred years in hell.'"  

24. The Fourth on Transgressions (Non-Anger)  

1. [Thus have I heard.] Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapiṇḍika's Park.  

2. At that time, two bhikkhus quarreled. One bhikkhu had committed an offense, and the other urged him to confess it. When he refused, a dispute arose.  

3. Then several bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and reported this matter.  

4. "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu denies an offense he has committed, and another bhikkhu lawfully urges him to confess, both are fools.  

5. Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu acknowledges his offense and confesses it lawfully, and the other bhikkhu accepts it, both are wise.  

6. Bhikkhus, in the distant past, Sakka admonished the Tavatimsa devas in the Hall of Justice with this verse:  

'Do not yield to anger’s realm. Do not let friendship decay. Do not speak divisive words. Do not dwell on faults. Anger crushes the wicked, as a mountain crushes its foe.'"  

25. The Fifth on Non-Anger (Non-Harm)  

1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapiṇḍika's Park.  

2. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:  

3. "Bhikkhus, in the distant past, Sakka admonished the Tavatimsa devas in the Hall of Justice with this verse:  

'Do not let anger conquer you. Do not repay anger with anger. The free from anger harm none. The noble ones abide thus. Anger crushes the wicked, as a mountain crushes its foe.'"
