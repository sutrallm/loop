Seated to one side, the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One:  

“Master Gotama, for what reason, owing to what condition, do these various speculative views arise in the world: ‘The world is eternal,’ ‘The world is not eternal,’ ‘The world is finite,’ ‘The world is infinite,’ ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ ‘The soul is different from the body,’ ‘After death a Tathagata exists,’ ‘After death a Tathagata does not exist,’ ‘After death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist,’ ‘After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist’?”  

4.  
“Vaccha, due to ignorance of form, ignorance of the origin of form, ignorance of the cessation of form, and ignorance of the path leading to the cessation of form, these various speculative views arise in the world: ‘The world is eternal’... ‘After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist.’ Vaccha, it is for this reason, owing to this condition, that these various speculative views arise in the world: ‘The world is eternal’... ‘After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist.’
