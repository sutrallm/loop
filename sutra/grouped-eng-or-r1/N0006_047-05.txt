5. The Deathless Chapter  

41. 1. The Deathless  
1. At Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus, dwell with minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, not missing the deathless. What are the four?  
3. Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued worldly covetousness and distress; [he dwells] contemplating feelings as feelings... mind as mind... phenomena as phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued worldly covetousness and distress.  
4. Bhikkhus, dwell with minds well established in these four establishments of mindfulness, not missing the deathless."  

42. 2. Origin  
2. "Bhikkhus, I will explain the arising and cessation of the four establishments of mindfulness. Listen carefully.  
3. Bhikkhus, what is the arising of the body? The body arises with the arising of food; the body ceases with the cessation of food.  
4. Feelings arise with the arising of contact; feelings cease with the cessation of contact.  
5. The mind arises with the arising of name-and-form; the mind ceases with the cessation of name-and-form.  
6. Phenomena arise with the arising of attention; phenomena cease with the cessation of attention."  

43. 3. The Path  
1. At Savatthi...  
2. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:  
3. "Bhikkhus, when I first attained enlightenment, dwelling at Uruvelā by the Nerañjara River at the foot of the Ajapala Banyan Tree, I considered: 'There is this one path for the purification of beings, for overcoming sorrow and lamentation, for the cessation of suffering and discontent, for realizing the true way, for attaining Nibbāna—namely, the four establishments of mindfulness. What are the four? A bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body... feelings... mind... phenomena as phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued worldly covetousness and distress. This is the one path leading to the purification of beings... for attaining Nibbāna—the four establishments of mindfulness.'  
4. Then Brahma Sahampati, knowing my thought, swiftly appeared before me like a strong man extending or retracting his arm.  
5. He arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, saluted me with joined palms, and said: 'So it is, Blessed One! This one path... the four establishments of mindfulness...'  
6. Brahma Sahampati then added: 'By this path, beings in the past, future, and present cross the flood.'"  

44. 4. Mindfulness  
1. At Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell mindful. This is my instruction.  
3. How does a bhikkhu dwell mindful? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body... feelings... mind... phenomena as phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued worldly covetousness and distress. Thus a bhikkhu dwells mindful.  
4. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell mindful. This is my instruction."  

45. 5. The Good Collection  
2. "Bhikkhus, the four establishments of mindfulness are rightly called the good collection. What are the four?  
3. Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body... feelings... mind... phenomena as phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued worldly covetousness and distress.  
4. These four establishments of mindfulness are rightly called the good collection."  

46. 6. Pratimokṣa  
2. Then a bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and said:  
3. "Venerable Sir, please teach me the Dhamma briefly. I will dwell alone, diligent, ardent, and resolute."  
4. "Then, bhikkhu, purify the beginning of wholesome states. What is the beginning? Guard the Pratimokṣa code, be perfected in conduct, perceive danger in minor faults, and train in the training rules. Established in virtue, cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness.  
5. Dwell contemplating the body as a body... feelings... mind... phenomena as phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful.  
6. Established in virtue, cultivate these. Day and night, expect growth in wholesome states, not decline."  
7. Delighted, the bhikkhu left.  
8. Dwelling diligent, he soon achieved the goal of the holy life, realizing: 'Destroyed are defilements, the holy life is lived, task done, no further existence.'  
9. He became an arahant.  

47. 7. Unwholesome Conduct  
2. A bhikkhu approached the Blessed One...  
3. "Venerable Sir, teach me briefly..."  
4. "Abandon bodily misconduct, cultivate good conduct... abandon verbal... mental misconduct. Established in virtue, cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness.  
5. Dwell contemplating the body... phenomena...  
6. Thus cultivate... expect growth, not decline."  
7-8. Delighted... he became an arahant.  

48. 8. Friends  
1. At Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus, out of compassion, instruct your friends and relatives in the four establishments of mindfulness.  
3. Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body... phenomena...  
4. Instruct them to cultivate these four."  

49. 9. Feelings  
1. At Savatthi...  
2. "Bhikkhus, there are three kinds of feelings: pleasant, painful, and neutral.  
3. To fully understand these, cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness.  
4. Dwell contemplating the body... phenomena...  
5. Cultivate these to fully know feelings."  

50. 10. Taints  
2. "Bhikkhus, there are three taints: sensuality, existence, and ignorance.  
3. To abandon these, cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness.  
4. Dwell contemplating the body... phenomena...  
5. Cultivate these to abandon taints."
