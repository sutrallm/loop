21. 3. The Sword Chapter  

21. 1. The Sword’s Touch  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. A deity standing to one side spoke this verse in the Buddha’s presence:  

[Deity:] Like a sword’s touch, like a hair ablaze, the bhikkhu should abandon sensual desires and mindfully go forth.  

3.  

[The Blessed One:] Like a sword’s touch, like a hair ablaze, the bhikkhu should abandon identity-view and mindfully go forth.  

22. 2. Contact  

1.  

[Deity:] One who does not make contact is unaffected. Those who make contact are bound. Hence, the untainted should not make contact.  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] Pure and untainted, yet if one taints the pure, that evil recoils on the fool like dust thrown against the wind.  

23. 3. Bonds  

1.  

[Deity:] Beings are bound by bonds inward and outward. I ask you, Gotama: How can one be freed from these bonds?  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] A bhikkhu established in virtue, wise, training mind and wisdom, ardent and prudent, discards greed and hatred, uproots delusion, and becomes an arahant with defilements ended. Erased are name-and-form, perceptions of obstruction and form. Where nothing remains, all bonds are severed.  

24. 4. Restraining the Mind  

1.  

[Deity:] Restraining the mind where it causes suffering, if one restrains it entirely, one is freed from all pain.  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] Not by total restraint, nor by unrestraint alone, but by restraining the mind where evils arise.  

25. 5. The Arahant  

1.  

[Deity:] An arahant bhikkhu, done with tasks, in his final body—should he say “I speak” or “they say”? How should he express himself?  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] An arahant bhikkhu, done with tasks, in his final body—he may say “I speak” or “they say.” Though he follows worldly conventions, the wise know this as mere usage.  

3.  

[Deity:] The arahant, done with tasks—if he speaks with conceit, saying “I” or “they,” then...  

4.  

[The Blessed One:] One freed from the chains of conceit, with wrong views uprooted, the wise may say “I” or “they” by convention, yet know this as mere usage.  

26. 6. Illumination  

1.  

[Deity:] How many lights illuminate the world? We ask the Blessed One: How may we understand this?  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] Four lights exist—no fifth here. The sun by day, the moon by night, fire at intervals, and the Buddha’s supreme light: this is the ultimate radiance.  

27. 7. The Stream  

1.  

[Deity:] Where does the stream not flow? Where do whirlpools cease? Where are name-and-form destroyed, leaving no trace?  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] When earth, water, fire, and wind find no footing, the stream stops, whirlpools cease. Here name-and-form are destroyed, leaving no trace.  

28. 8. Great Wealth  

1.  

[Deity:] The wealthy, nobles reigning, still crave and envy. Bound by greed, they drift in currents. Who in the world is free from envy and thirst?  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] Those who leave home, relinquish wealth and kin, abandon greed, hatred, and delusion, becoming arahants—they dwell without envy.  

29. 9. Four Wheels  

1.  

[Deity:] Four wheels, nine openings, filled with filth and craving—how does the sage escape this foul swamp?  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] Severing craving’s ropes, uprooting longing—thus one escapes.  

30. 10. The Deer’s Snare  

1.  

[Deity:] Like a deer, gentle and free, eating little, unattached, or like lions and elephants roaming alone—how does one escape suffering?  

2.  

[The Blessed One:] Detached from the five sensual cords and the sixth (the mind’s cravings), one escapes suffering.  

Udāna:  
The sword’s touch, the restrained mind, bonds, the arahant, illumination, the stream, wealth, four wheels, and the deer’s snare.
