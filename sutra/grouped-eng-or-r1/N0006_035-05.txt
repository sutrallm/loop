5. Impermanence Chapter  

At Savatthi. There, those...  

[43] 1. Impermanence  
"Bhikkhus, all is impermanent."  

[44] 2. Suffering  
"Bhikkhus, all is suffering."  

[45] 3. Non-Self

[46] 4. To Be Understood

[47] 5. To Be Fully Known

[48] 6. To Be Abandoned

[49] 7. To Be Directly Realized

[50] 8. To Be Comprehended and Penetrated  
"Bhikkhus, all is to be comprehended and penetrated."  

[51] 9. A Burden  
"Bhikkhus, all is a burden."  

[52] 10. Crushed  
2. "Bhikkhus, all is to be crushed. Bhikkhus, what is to be crushed?  

3-6. The eye is to be crushed, forms to be crushed, eye-consciousness to be crushed, eye-contact to be crushed. The feeling born of eye-contact—whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—that too is to be crushed. The ear... sound... nose... odor... tongue... flavor... body... tactile object...  

7. The mind is to be crushed, mental phenomena to be crushed, mind-consciousness to be crushed, mind-contact to be crushed. The feeling born of mind-contact—whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—that too is to be crushed.  

8. Bhikkhus, when one sees this thus, the learned noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms... disenchanted with the mind. Being disenchanted, one becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, one is liberated. Being liberated, there is knowledge: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’"
