30. Chapter 4: On Joyful Consent  

1. At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, there are these four elements. What four? The earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the wind element. Bhikkhus, these are the four elements."  

31. Second: Earlier  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, before my full awakening, while I was still a bodhisatta, this thought arose in me:  
3. ‘What is the gratification of the earth element? What is its danger? What is the escape from it? What is the gratification of the water element? What is its danger? What is the escape from it? What is the gratification of the fire element? What is its danger? What is the escape from it? What is the gratification of the wind element? What is its danger? What is the escape from it?’  
4. Bhikkhus, this thought arose in me:  
5. The pleasure and joy that arises dependent on the earth element: this is its gratification. That the earth element is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this is its danger. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for the earth element: this is the escape from it.  
6. [Similarly for the water element...]  
7. [Similarly for the fire element...]  
8. The pleasure and joy that arises dependent on the wind element: this is its gratification. That the wind element is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this is its danger. The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for the wind element: this is the escape from it.  
9. Bhikkhus, as long as I did not truly understand these four elements’ gratification as gratification, danger as danger, and escape as escape, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, brahmins, devas, and humans.  
10. But when I truly understood these four elements’ gratification as gratification, danger as danger, and escape as escape, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world...  
11. The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My mind is liberated; this is my last birth; there is now no renewed existence.’"  

32. Third: My Pursuit  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, I pursued the gratification of the earth element. Having attained the gratification of the earth element, I have fully understood it with wisdom.  
3. I pursued the danger of the earth element. Having attained the danger of the earth element, I have fully understood it with wisdom.  
4. I pursued the escape from the earth element. Having attained the escape from the earth element, I have fully understood it with wisdom.  
5–7. [Similarly for the water element...]  
8–10. [Similarly for the fire element...]  
11–13. [Similarly for the wind element...]  
14. Bhikkhus, as long as I did not truly understand these four elements...  
15. But when I truly understood these four elements...  
16. The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My mind is liberated...’"  

33. Fourth: If There Were Not  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, if there were no gratification in the earth element, beings would not become enamored with it. But because there is gratification in the earth element, beings become enamored with it.  
3. If there were no danger in the earth element, beings would not grow disenchanted with it. But because there is danger in the earth element, beings grow disenchanted with it.  
4. If there were no escape from the earth element, beings would not escape from it. But because there is an escape from the earth element, beings escape from it.  
5–7. [Similarly for the water element...]  
8–10. [Similarly for the fire element...]  
11–13. [Similarly for the wind element...]  
14. Bhikkhus, as long as beings do not truly understand these four elements’ gratification as gratification... they are not freed from this world...  
15. But when beings truly understand these four elements... they are freed..."  

34. Fifth: Suffering  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, if the earth element were exclusively suffering... beings would not become enamored with it. But because the earth element is pleasurable... beings become enamored with it.  
3. [Similarly for the water element...]  
4. [Similarly for the fire element...]  
5. [Similarly for the wind element...]  
6. If the earth element were exclusively pleasurable... beings would not grow disenchanted with it. But because the earth element is suffering... beings grow disenchanted with it.  
7–9. [Similarly for the remaining elements...]"  

35. Sixth: Joyful Consent  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, I say that one who consents to the earth element consents to suffering. One who consents to suffering is not freed from suffering.  
3–4. [Similarly for the water and fire elements...]  
5. One who consents to the wind element consents to suffering...  
6–8. [Similarly for not consenting to the elements...]  
9. One who does not consent to the wind element... is freed from suffering."  

36. Seventh: Arising  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, the arising, continuation, rebirth, and manifestation of the earth element is the arising of suffering, the continuation of craving, and the manifestation of aging-and-death.  
3–5. [Similarly for the other elements...]  
6–9. The cessation, calming, and ending of the elements is the cessation of suffering..."  

37. Eighth: Ascetics and Brahmins (1)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, there are these four elements...  
3. Any ascetics or brahmins... not knowing these elements’ gratification, danger, and escape are not true ascetics or brahmins...  
4. But those who know them... are true ascetics or brahmins..."  

38. Ninth: Ascetics and Brahmins (2)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, there are these four elements...  
3. Any ascetics or brahmins... not knowing their origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape are not true ascetics...  
4. ...but those who know them fully..."  

39. Tenth: Ascetics and Brahmins (3)  

1. [At that time, the Blessed One] was dwelling at Savatthi.  
2. [The Blessed One said:] "Bhikkhus, any ascetics or brahmins... not knowing the earth element, its origin, cessation, and path to cessation... are not true ascetics...  
5. ...those who know them... are true ascetics..."
