8. Village Headmen  
1. Violence  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  

2. Then the village headman named Violence approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.  

3. Sitting to one side, he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, here someone is called ‘violent.’ What is the cause, what the reason for this? And here someone is called ‘gentle.’ What is the cause, what the reason for this?”  

4. “Village headman, here someone has not abandoned greed. Because of not abandoning greed, they provoke others to anger and encounter anger from others. When their own anger is manifested, they are called ‘violent.’ They have not abandoned hatred... delusion... This is the cause and reason why someone here is called ‘violent.’  

5. But here, village headman, someone has abandoned greed. Because of abandoning greed, they do not provoke others to anger or encounter anger from others. When their own anger is not manifested, they are called ‘gentle.’ They have abandoned hatred... delusion... This is the cause and reason why someone here is called ‘gentle.’”  

6. When this was said, the village headman Violence said: “Excellent, venerable sir!... From today onward, may the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”  

2. Potaliya  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.  

2. Then the village headman Potaliya the Entertainer approached the Blessed One...  

3. Sitting to one side, he said: “Venerable sir, I have heard from past generations of entertainers’ teachers that one who amuses people in theaters with true or false performances, after death, is reborn among the laughing devas. What does the Blessed One say about this?”  

“Enough, headman. Let this be. Do not ask me this.”  

4. A second time... A third time...  

5. “Though I discourage you, I will answer.  

6. Headman, when people were still bound by greed, anger, and delusion, entertainers inflamed their lust, hatred, and confusion. Such a person, indulging in heedlessness and making others heedless, is reborn in the ‘Laughter Hell.’ If one holds such a wrong view, I declare they go to hell or the animal realm.”  

8. When this was said, Potaliya wept...  

9. “Magnificent, venerable sir!... May I receive the going forth under the Blessed One.”  

10. Potaliya received full ordination...  

11. ...and became an arahant.  

3. Warrior  

2. Then the village headman Warrior approached...  

3. “Venerable sir, I have heard that warriors who die fighting in battle are reborn among the devas of comrades. What does the Blessed One say?”  

“Enough, headman...  

6. If a warrior with a mind of harm, aiming to kill, is slain, he is reborn in the ‘Comrades’ Hell.’ Whoever holds such a wrong view goes to hell or the animal realm.”  

7. The warrior wept...  

8. “Magnificent, sir!... I go for refuge...”  

4. Elephant  

[Similar structure to Warrior, with “elephant rider” replacing “warrior”]  

5. Horse  

[Similar structure to Warrior, with “horse rider” replacing “warrior”]  

6. Westerner  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was staying at Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.  

2. Then the village headman Dasama approached...  

3. “Venerable sir, some carry Brahmin’s water pots, wear garlands, bathe, and tend sacred fires to uplift the dead. Can women be reborn in heaven?”  

4. “What do you think, headman? If a murderer, thief, adulterer, liar, divider, abuser, gossiper, greedy, malicious, and wrong-viewer dies, would masses praying for him send him to heaven?”  

5. “No, venerable sir.”  

6. “Just as a heavy stone sinks despite prayers, so evildoers go to hell.  

7. But if a virtuous person dies, their good kamma lifts them like oil floating above water, regardless of masses’ curses.”  

9. “Magnificent, sir!... I go for refuge...”  

7. Teaching  

1. At Nālandā...  

3. “Does the Blessed One teach compassionately to all?”  

4. “Tathāgatas teach with compassion.”  

5. “Why then teach some more than others?”  

6. “A farmer sows best soil first. So I teach monks and nuns first, then devout laymen, then hostile outsiders.”  

10. “Magnificent, sir!...”  

8. Conch  

4. “Nigaṇṭha’s teaching that habit determines destiny is wrong. How long is one virtuous versus sinful? Habitual virtue leads upward.”  

9. “By wrong view, they fall to hell.”  

19. “Magnificent!...”  

9. Household  

8. “Why wander during famine, exhausting households?”  

9. “For 91 eons, no giver was harmed. Households decline due to kings, thieves, fire, water, waste, laziness, spendthrifts, and impermanence—not almsgiving.”  

12. “Magnificent!...”  

10. Topknot  

7. “Monks neither accept nor seek gold. To accept sensual pleasures is unworthy of ascetics.”  

11. Donkey  

3. “Teach me suffering’s origin and cessation.”  

4. “Sorrow arises from craving. Cut craving to end sorrow.”  

12. King’s Hair  

3. “The Buddha rejects extreme austerity. The Middle Way—the Noble Eightfold Path—leads to Nirvana.”  

38. “Magnificent!...”  

13. Bazaar  

2. “Does the Buddha know miracles?”  

4. “I know illusions’ danger. Miracles lead to hell if misused.”  

53. “Magnificent!...”
