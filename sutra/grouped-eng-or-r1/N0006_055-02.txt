2. The Chapter of a Thousand (The King’s Garden)  

[11] First: A Thousand  

1. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the King’s Garden.  
2. Then, a thousand bhikkhunīs approached the Blessed One’s dwelling. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.  
3. The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhunīs standing to one side: “Bhikkhunīs, a noble disciple who possesses four qualities is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the lower realms, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination. What are the four qualities?  
4. Here, bhikkhunīs, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’  
5–6. In the Dhamma... in the Saṅgha...  
7. They possess the virtue loved by the noble ones—unbroken, unflawed, unblemished, untarnished, liberating, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to samādhi.  
8. Bhikkhunīs, a noble disciple who possesses these four qualities is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the lower realms, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination.”  

[12] Second: The Brahmins  

1–2. At Sāvatthī.  
3. “Bhikkhus, the brahmins proclaim a so-called ‘upward path’ and instruct their disciples thus: ‘Come, young man, rise in the morning and proceed eastward without avoiding pits, mounds, stakes, thorny grounds, drainage ditches, or cesspools. If you die from a fall, you will be reborn in a happy realm, a heavenly world.’  
4. Bhikkhus, this path of the brahmins is foolish and deluded. It does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, or Nibbāna. Bhikkhus, in the Noble One’s discipline, I teach an upward path that does lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and Nibbāna. What is this upward path?  
5. Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha... in the Dhamma... in the Saṅgha... They possess the virtue loved by the noble ones... leading to samādhi.  
6. Bhikkhus, this upward path leads solely to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and Nibbāna.”  

[13] Third: Ānanda  

1. Once, the Venerable Ānanda and the Venerable Sāriputta were dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  
2. In the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged courteous and agreeable words before sitting to one side.  
3. The Venerable Sāriputta asked: “Friend Ānanda, abandoning how many qualities and acquiring how many qualities does the Blessed One declare a being to be a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the lower realms, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as their destination?”  
4. “Friend, abandoning four qualities and acquiring four qualities, the Blessed One declares a being to be a stream-enterer...  
5. An uninstructed ordinary person slanders the Buddha and is reborn in hell. A noble disciple, possessing unwavering confidence in the Buddha, is reborn in heaven.  
6. Similarly, regarding slander of the Dhamma...  
7. Similarly, regarding slander of the Saṅgha...  
8. An uninstructed ordinary person is immoral and reborn in hell. A noble disciple, possessing virtue loved by the noble ones... leading to samādhi, is reborn in heaven.  
9. Thus, abandoning these four qualities and acquiring these four, one is declared a stream-enterer...”  

[14] Fourth: Lower Realms (1)  

3. “Bhikkhus, a noble disciple possessing four qualities transcends all fear of lower realms. What four?  
4–7. Unwavering confidence in the Buddha... Dhamma... Saṅgha... virtue loved by the noble ones...  
8. Such a noble disciple transcends all fear of lower realms.”  

[15] Fifth: Lower Realms (2)  

3. (Same as [14], substituting “lower realms and states of deprivation”.)  

[16] Sixth: Friends (1)  

3. “Bhikkhus, if you have compassionate friends, relatives, or kin to instruct, urge them to cultivate the four factors of stream-entry:  
4. Confidence in the Buddha... Dhamma... Saṅgha... virtue loved by the noble ones...  
5. This is how to guide them.”  

[17] Seventh: Friends (2)  

3–7. (Similar to [16], emphasizing that even if the four elements change, noble disciples with these four qualities remain unshaken, free from rebirth in lower realms.)  

[18] Eighth: Divine Travel (1)  

2. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna vanished from Jeta’s Grove and appeared in the Tāvatiṃsa heaven.  
3–7. He taught the devas: “Confidence in the Buddha... Dhamma... Saṅgha... virtue loved by the noble ones leads to rebirth in heaven.”  
8–11. The devas affirmed his teaching.  

[19] Ninth: Divine Travel (2)  

(Parallel to [18], with Mahāmoggallāna again instructing devas.)  

[20] Tenth: Divine Travel (3)  

2. The Blessed One appeared in Tāvatiṃsa and taught the devas similarly.
