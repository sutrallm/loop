1. Amra Vagga  
1. Amra  

1.1 Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesali in the Amra Grove.  

1.2 There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said:  

1.3 "Bhikkhus, there is this one path that purifies beings, overcomes sorrow and lamentation, extinguishes suffering and discontent, attains the true way, and realizes Nibbana—that is, the four foundations of mindfulness. What are the four?  

1.4 Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings... mind in mind... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world.  

1.5 Bhikkhus, this is the one path that purifies beings, overcomes sorrow and lamentation, extinguishes suffering and discontent, attains the true way, and realizes Nibbana—that is, the four foundations of mindfulness."  

1.6 When this was said, those bhikkhus rejoiced and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.  

2. Right Mindfulness  

2.1 At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesali in the Amra Grove.  

2.2 There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said:  

2.3 "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell mindful and clearly comprehending. This is my instruction to you.  

2.4 And how is a bhikkhu mindful? Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings... mind in mind... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world. Thus is a bhikkhu mindful.  

2.5 And how is a bhikkhu clearly comprehending? Here, a bhikkhu acts with clear comprehension when going forward and returning; when looking ahead and looking aside; when bending and stretching limbs; when wearing robes and carrying the bowl; when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; when defecating and urinating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and remaining silent. Thus is a bhikkhu clearly comprehending.  

2.6 Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should dwell mindful and clearly comprehending. This is my instruction to you."  

3. The Bhikkhu  

3.1 At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.  

3.2 Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage, sat down, and said: "Venerable sir, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Hearing the Dhamma, I will dwell alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute."  

3.3 "If some foolish persons here were to ask me for a brief teaching, I would have to reflect. But since you are wise, I shall answer. A bhikkhu should first purify the beginning of wholesome states. What is the beginning? Virtue that is well purified and straight view. Established in virtue and possessing straight view, a bhikkhu should cultivate the four foundations of mindfulness in three ways. What are the four?  

3.4 Here, bhikkhu, dwell contemplating the body internally... externally... both internally and externally as a body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world. Dwell contemplating feelings... mind... phenomena internally... externally... both internally and externally as phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world.  

3.5 Established in virtue, cultivating these four foundations of mindfulness thus, bhikkhu, you may expect growth in wholesome states day and night, not decline."  

3.6 Delighted, that bhikkhu rose, paid homage, and left.  

3.7 Dwellling alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute, he realized the supreme goal of the holy life. He directly knew: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of existence."  

3.8 That bhikkhu became one of the arahants.  

4. Sala  

4.1 Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling in the Kosala country at the Brahmin village of Sala.  

4.2 There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!" "Venerable sir!" they replied. The Blessed One said:  

4.3 "Bhikkhus, newly ordained bhikkhus who have recently gone forth, newly entered this Dhamma and Discipline, should be exhorted and established in the four foundations of mindfulness. What four?  

4.4 ‘Friends, dwell contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, unified, with a purified mind, concentrated, one-pointed—for the full understanding of the body. Dwell contemplating feelings... mind... phenomena in phenomena... for the full understanding of phenomena.’  

4.5 Bhikkhus in training who have not attained liberation but aspire to the supreme security should dwell thus for the full understanding of these phenomena.  

4.6 Even arahant bhikkhus, whose taints are destroyed, live contemplating these foundations, liberated from clinging.  

4.7 Therefore, newly ordained bhikkhus should be thus exhorted."  

5. The Good Collection  

5.1 At Savatthi... The Blessed One said:  

5.3 "The bad collection is the five hindrances—sensual desire, ill will, sloth-torpor, restlessness-remorse, doubt. The good collection is the four foundations of mindfulness—contemplating body, feelings, mind, phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, subduing worldly greed and distress."  

6. The Hawk  

6.3 "Once a hawk suddenly seized a quail. The quail lamented: ‘If only I had stayed in my own domain! Then this hawk couldn’t harm me.’ The hawk replied: ‘What is your domain?’ ‘The freshly plowed field.’  

6.4 The hawk let go, saying: ‘Go, but you won’t escape.’ The quail fled to the field and taunted the hawk. The hawk swooped but crashed into the clod, harming itself.  

6.5 Similarly, bhikkhus, wander not in others’ domain—the five cords of sensual pleasure. Your domain is the four foundations of mindfulness. Dwell there, and Mara gains no foothold."  

7. The Monkey  

7.3 "In the Himalayas, steep places exist where neither monkeys nor humans go; some where monkeys go but not humans; and pleasant parks where both go. Hunters trap monkeys there with sticky sap.  

7.4 A foolish monkey touching the sap gets stuck. Struggling, it is fully trapped.  

7.5 So too, those wandering in others’ domain—the five sensuals—are trapped by Mara. Your domain is the four foundations of mindfulness."  

8. The Cook  

8.3 "An unskilled cook serves varied dishes but doesn’t please the master. Similarly, a bhikkhu meditating on the four foundations without concentration or insight gains no bliss.  

8.8 But a skilled cook knows the master’s taste and serves rightly. Similarly, a skilled bhikkhu meditating gains concentration, removes defilements, and knows peace.  

8.11 Thus dwell mindful and discerning."  

9. The Sickness  

9.1 Once the Blessed One dwelled at Vesali in the Bamboo Grove, afflicted by severe sickness. Resolving to live, he recovered.  

9.6 To Ananda, he said: "Be your own island, the Dhamma your refuge. Dwell contemplating the four foundations. For those who do so, diligent, they are my foremost disciples."  

10. The Bhikkhuni  

10.1 At Savatthi...  

10.5 To bhikkhunis claiming proficiency in the four foundations, Ananda affirmed their practice. The Buddha explained how to cultivate mindfulness with and without supports, attaining joy and liberation.  

10.18 "Thus train in bound and unbound mindfulness. Dwell heedful. This is my instruction."  

10.19 Ananda rejoiced in the words.
