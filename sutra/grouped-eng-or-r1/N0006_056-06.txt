6. The Chapter on Direct Realization  

51. First: The Tip of the Fingernail  
2. At that time, the Blessed One placed a small amount of dust on the tip of his fingernail and addressed the monks:  
"Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the tiny dust on my fingernail or the great earth?"  
"Venerable sir, the great earth is far more. The dust on the Blessed One's fingernail is exceedingly small. Compared to the great earth, it cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
3. "Monks, in the same way, for a noble disciple endowed with vision who has realized direct knowledge, the suffering that has been utterly destroyed is far greater, while what remains is exceedingly small. Compared to the previously destroyed mass of suffering, it cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction. This is at most seven more lifetimes. They understand as it really is: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'  
4. Therefore, monks, you should strive to understand: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering!'"  

52. Second: The Lake  
2. "Monks, suppose there were a lake fifty leagues long, fifty leagues wide, and fifty leagues deep, filled to the brim. A person draws out water with the tip of a blade of grass.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the water drawn by the blade of grass or the water in the lake?"  
"Venerable sir, the lake’s water is far more. The water drawn by the blade of grass is exceedingly small. Compared to the lake’s water, it cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4-5. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple... should strive!"  

53. Third: Confluence (1)  
2. "Monks, suppose the great rivers—the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—all merged together. A person draws out two or three drops of water.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the two or three drops drawn out or the water in the confluence?"  
"Venerable sir, the confluence’s water is far more. The two or three drops are exceedingly small. Compared to the confluence’s water, they cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4-5. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple... should strive!"  

54. Fourth: Confluence (2)  
2. "Monks, suppose all the water in the great rivers—the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—were to dry up, leaving only two or three drops.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the dried-up water or the remaining two or three drops?"  
"Venerable sir, the dried-up water is far more. The two or three remaining drops are exceedingly small. Compared to the dried-up water, they cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4-5. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple... should strive!"  

55. Fifth: Earth (1)  
2. "Monks, suppose a person placed seven tiny clay balls the size of jujube pits upon the great earth.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the seven jujube-sized clay balls or the great earth?"  
"Venerable sir, the great earth is far more. The seven clay balls are exceedingly small. Compared to the great earth, they cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4-5. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple... should strive!"  

56. Sixth: Earth (2)  
2. "Monks, suppose the great earth were to perish, leaving only seven tiny clay balls the size of jujube pits.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the perished earth or the seven remaining clay balls?"  
"Venerable sir, the perished earth is far more. The seven remaining clay balls are exceedingly small. Compared to the perished earth, they cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4-5. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple... should strive!"  

57. Seventh: Ocean (1)  
2. "Monks, suppose a person drew out two or three drops of water from the great ocean.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the two or three drops drawn out or the ocean’s water?"  
"Venerable sir, the ocean’s water is far more. The two or three drops are exceedingly small. Compared to the ocean’s water, they cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4-5. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple... should strive!"  

58. Eighth: Ocean (2)  
2. "Monks, suppose the water of the great ocean were to dry up, leaving only two or three drops.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the dried-up ocean water or the two or three remaining drops?"  
"Venerable sir, the dried-up ocean water is far more. The remaining two or three drops are exceedingly small. Compared to the dried-up ocean water, they cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4-5. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple... should strive!"  

59. Ninth: Mountain Simile (1)  
2. "Monks, suppose someone placed seven gravel stones the size of mustard seeds on Mount Sineru, the king of mountains.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the seven mustard-sized stones or Mount Sineru?"  
"Venerable sir, Mount Sineru is far more. The seven stones are exceedingly small. Compared to Mount Sineru, they cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4-5. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple... should strive!"  

60. Tenth: Mountain Simile (2)  
2. "Monks, suppose Mount Sineru were to perish, leaving only seven gravel stones the size of mustard seeds.  
3. Monks, what do you think? Which is more: the perished Mount Sineru or the seven remaining stones?"  
"Venerable sir, the perished Mount Sineru is far more. The seven stones are exceedingly small. Compared to the perished mountain, they cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction."  
4. "Monks, in the same way, a noble disciple endowed with vision who has realized direct knowledge has utterly destroyed far more suffering, while what remains is exceedingly small. Compared to the previously destroyed mass of suffering, it cannot be reckoned, cannot be compared, not even a fraction. This is at most seven more lifetimes. They understand as it really is: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'  
5. Therefore, monks, you should strive to understand: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering!'"
