1. 1. The Chapter of Reeds  
1. The Torrent  
1. Thus I have heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.  
2. Then a certain deity, emanating a magnificent radiance throughout Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One during the night. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.  
3. Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Blessed One: "Friend, how have you crossed the torrent?" The Blessed One replied: "Friend, I crossed the torrent neither halting nor striving." The deity asked: "Friend, how is it that you crossed the torrent neither halting nor striving?" The Blessed One answered: "When I halted, I sank; when I strove, I was swept away. Thus, friend, I crossed the torrent neither halting nor striving."  
4. "At last I see a brahmin, fully quenched, who neither halts nor strives, having crossed attachment to the world."  
5. Then that deity, having received approval from the Master, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him clockwise, and vanished.  

2. Liberation  
1. [At that time the Blessed One was dwelling] at Savatthi...  
2. Then a certain deity... approached the Blessed One during the night...  
3. The deity asked: "Friend, do you know the liberation, the release, and the detachment of beings?" The Blessed One replied: "Friend, I know the liberation, the release, and the detachment of beings." The deity asked: "Friend, how do you know these?"  
4. "By the cessation of delight, the ending of perceptions and consciousness, the stilling of feelings—thus, friend, I know the liberation, release, and detachment of beings."  

3. The Guide  
1. Standing to one side, the deity recited this verse:  
"Life's guide is death, lifespan brief; no refuge exists for one guided by aging. Seeing this terror in death, accumulate merit bringing bliss."  
2. [The Blessed One:] "Life's guide is death, lifespan brief; no refuge exists for one guided by aging. Seeing this terror in death, abandon longing, seek peace."  

4. Time Slips By  
1. The deity recited:  
"Time passes, nights roll on; youth abandons us. Seeing this terror in death, accumulate merit bringing bliss."  
2. [The Blessed One:] "Time passes, nights roll on; youth abandons us. Seeing this terror in death, abandon longing, seek peace."  

5. How Much Cut Off  
1. The deity asked:  
"How much is cut off, how much abandoned? How much further must one cultivate? How many bonds must one transcend to be called a stream-crosser?"  
2. [The Blessed One:] "Cut off five, abandon five; cultivate five beyond. One who transcends five bonds is called a stream-crosser."  

6. Unawake  
1. The deity asked:  
"Some wake while others sleep; some sleep while others wake. Bound by what do they stay defiled? By what do they become purified?"  
2. [The Blessed One:] "Bound by five they are defiled; through five they become pure."  

7. Not Comprehending  
1. The deity said:  
"Not comprehending the Dhamma, led to other doctrines—such a one sleeps unawakened. Now is the time to wake!"  
2. [The Blessed One:] "Comprehending the Dhamma, not led to other doctrines—they awaken fully, treading the uneven with ease."  

8. Deluded  
1. The deity said:  
"Deluded regarding the Dhamma, led to other doctrines—deeply asleep, unawakened. Now is the time to wake!"  
2. [The Blessed One:] "Undeluded regarding the Dhamma, not led to other doctrines—they awaken fully, treading the uneven with ease."  

9. Desire and Conceit  
1. The deity said:  
"Driven by desire and conceit, unsettled, restless-minded—even dwelling alone in forests, unrestrained, one fails to cross death's realm."  
2. [The Blessed One:] "Discarding conceit, tranquil in mind, freed by wisdom—dwelling alone, vigilant, one crossess death's realm."  

10. Forest Dwellers  
1. The deity asked:  
"Those who dwell in forests, calm and pure, eating but once a day—why do their faces shine so brightly?"  
2. [The Blessed One:] "They grieve not for the past, nor yearn for the future. Sustained by the present, their faces shine. Fools wither like cut reeds, mourning the past and craving the future."
