5. The Chapter on the Deep Chasm  

41. First: Reflection  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at the Bamboo Grove, in the Squirrel Sanctuary.  

2. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, in the past, a man went to the Sumāgadhā Pond with the thought, 'I will reflect on the world.' He came to the shore of Sumāgadhā Pond and sat down to reflect on the world.  

3. Bhikkhus, while sitting on the shore of Sumāgadhā Pond, he saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. Seeing this, he thought, 'I must be mad! I must be insane! I see what does not exist in the world!'  

4. Bhikkhus, then that man rushed into the city and announced to the crowd: 'Sirs, I am mad! Sirs, I am insane! I see what does not exist in the world!'  

They said: 'Man, how are you mad? How are you insane? What do you see that does not exist in the world?'  

5. 'Sirs, leaving Rājagaha, I went to Sumāgadhā Pond with the thought, "I will reflect on the world." Sitting on the shore, I saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. Sirs, thus I am mad; thus I am insane; I see what does not exist in the world!'  

They replied: 'Indeed, you are mad! Indeed, you are insane! What you see does not exist in the world!'  

6. Bhikkhus, yet that man saw reality, not unreality. Bhikkhus, in the past, the devas and asuras were engaged in battle. In that battle, the devas won and the asuras were defeated. Terrified by their defeat, the asuras fled into their palace through the lotus stalks to evade the devas.  

7. Therefore, bhikkhus, do not reflect on the world, thinking: 'The world is eternal,' 'The world is not eternal,' 'The world is finite,' 'The world is infinite,' 'The soul is the body,' 'The soul is separate from the body,' 'A Tathāgata exists after death,' 'A Tathāgata does not exist after death,' 'A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,' 'A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.' Why?  

8. Bhikkhus, such reflections are unbeneficial, irrelevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and do not lead to dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, or Nibbāna.  

9. Bhikkhus, when you reflect, you should reflect on: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.' Why?  

10. Bhikkhus, this reflection is beneficial, relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and leads to dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and Nibbāna.  

11. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should strive to understand: 'This is suffering,' 'This is the origin of suffering,' 'This is the cessation of suffering,' 'This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.'"  

42. Second: The Deep Chasm  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, on Vulture Peak Mountain.  

2. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, let us go to Paṇḍava Peak for the day's abiding." The bhikkhus assented: "Yes, Venerable Sir."  

3. Then the Blessed One, together with many bhikkhus, went to Paṇḍava Peak. A certain bhikkhu saw a deep, terrifying chasm there and said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, this chasm is vast and fearful! Is there any chasm deeper or more terrifying than this?"  

4. "Bhikkhu, there is a chasm deeper and more terrifying than this." "What is it, Venerable Sir?"  

"Bhikkhu, those ascetics or brahmins who do not truly understand suffering, its origin, its cessation, or the path leading to its cessation delight in volitional formations rooted in birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. By delighting in these, they increase formations rooted in birth, aging, death... and thus fall into the chasm of birth, aging, death... They are not freed from suffering.  

5. But those who truly understand suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path do not delight in such formations. Without delight, these formations do not increase. They do not fall into the chasms of birth, aging, death... They are liberated from suffering.  

6. Therefore, bhikkhus, strive to understand: 'This is suffering... this is the path.'"  

43. Third: The Blazing  

2. "Bhikkhus, there exists a hell called the Great Blaze. There, beings perceive only the unlovely, hear only the unlovely..."  

3. A bhikkhu asked: "Venerable Sir, is there a blaze greater and more terrifying than this?"  

4. "Yes. Those who do not understand the Four Noble Truths delight in formations leading to birth, aging, death... They ignite the blaze of birth, aging... and are not freed from suffering.  

5. Those who understand the truths do not delight in such formations. The blaze does not ignite; they are liberated.  

6. Therefore, strive..."  

44. Fourth: The Storied Mansion  

2. "Bhikkhus, one cannot reach the end of suffering without realizing the Four Noble Truths, just as one cannot build the upper floor of a mansion without its foundation.  

3. But by realizing the truths, one can reach the end of suffering, like building a mansion on a firm foundation.  

6. Therefore, strive..."  

45. Fifth: The Hair  

1. At Vesālī, the Blessed One stayed in the Great Wooden Hall.  

2. Venerable Ānanda saw Licchavi youths skillfully shooting arrows through tiny keyholes.  

3. The Blessed One said: "Ānanda, piercing a hundredth part of a hair’s tip is harder. Similarly, understanding the Four Noble Truths is harder.  

9. Therefore, strive..."  

46. Sixth: The Darkness  

2. "Bhikkhus, there is darkness so profound that sunlight cannot dispel it."  

3. A bhikkhu asked if a darker darkness exists.  

4. "Yes: those ignorant of the truths dwell in the darkness of birth, aging, death...  

5. Those who understand are freed.  

6. Therefore, strive..."  

47. Seventh: The Yoke (1)  

2. "Bhikkhus, suppose a blind turtle surfacing once a century chances its neck through a single-holed yoke drifting in the ocean. Rebirth as a human is rarer.  

6. Because beings do not see the Four Noble Truths, they devour one another.  

7. Therefore, strive..."  

48. Eighth: The Yoke (2)  

2. "Even with winds tossing the yoke, the turtle’s chance remains rarer than human birth, a Buddha’s arising, and encountering his Dhamma.  

6. Therefore, strive..."  

49. Ninth: Mount Sineru (1)  

2. "Seven pebbles on Sineru are insignificant compared to the mountain. Similarly, a noble disciple’s remaining suffering is negligible."  

5. Therefore, strive..."  

50. Tenth: Mount Sineru (2)  

2. "If Sineru were destroyed, leaving seven pebbles, the destroyed mass would dwarf them. Similarly, a noble disciple’s remaining suffering is trivial."  

5. Therefore, strive..."
