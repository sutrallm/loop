4. "Ananda, I do not say that gains, offerings, and fame are an obstacle for one who dwells in imperturbable liberation of mind.  

5. Ananda, but for one who dwells diligent, ardent, and resolute, enjoying the bliss of meditation here and now, gains, offerings, and fame are an obstacle.  

6. Ananda, gains, offerings, and fame are indeed so fearful, harsh, and cruel that they obstruct the attainment of the unexcused security from bondage, Nibbana.  

7. Ananda, therefore, train yourselves thus: 'We will abandon arisen gains, offerings, and fame, and our minds will not be entangled by unarisen gains, offerings, and fame.'  

8. Ananda, you should train yourselves thus."
