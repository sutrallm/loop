14. The Ganges Extended Discourse (Subduing Sensual Desire)  
[121] 1.  
2.  
"Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges River flows eastward, slopes eastward, merges eastward, so too a bhikkhu who cultivates the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, who frequently cultivates the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, flows toward Nibbāna, slopes toward Nibbāna, merges into Nibbāna.  
Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu cultivate the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, frequently cultivate them, and thereby flow toward Nibbāna, slope toward Nibbāna, merge into Nibbāna?  

3.  
Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu cultivates the enlightenment factor of mindfulness by subduing and exhausting sensual desire, subduing and exhausting ill will, subduing and exhausting delusion... [the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states... the enlightenment factor of energy... the enlightenment factor of rapture... the enlightenment factor of tranquility... the enlightenment factor of concentration]... the enlightenment factor of equanimity.  
Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu cultivates the Seven Factors of Enlightenment in this way, frequently cultivates them, he flows toward Nibbāna, slopes toward Nibbāna, merges into Nibbāna."  

[122–132] 2.–12.  
In the same way, [the discourse] is extended through the subjugation and exhaustion of sensual desire up to the section on seeking.  

Summary Verses:  
Six on flowing eastward,  
Six on flowing to the ocean,  
Twice six make twelve—  
Thus this chapter is taught.  

Through the extended analogy of the Ganges corresponding to the Factors of Enlightenment, this chapter extensively explains the subjugation of sensual desire.
