7. Citta Saṃyutta  
1. Bonds  
1. At one time, many elder bhikkhus dwelled at the Ambātakavana Grove on the Makkarakaṭa Mountain.  
2. At that time, after returning from their alms-round, the elder bhikkhus assembled and sat together in the circular hall, engaging in conversation: "Friends, when they speak of 'bond' or 'factors of bondage,' do these two differ in meaning or wording? Or are they one in meaning and differ only in wording?"  
3. Among them, some elder bhikkhus explained: "Friend, 'bond' and 'factors of bondage' differ in both meaning and wording." Others said: "Friends, 'bond' and 'factors of bondage' are one in meaning but differ only in wording."  
4. At that time, the householder Citta arrived in Macchikāsaṇḍa on some business.  
5. Hearing the elder bhikkhus' discussion after their meal, he approached their dwelling, paid homage, and sat to one side.  
6. Seated, he addressed them: "Venerable ones, regarding 'bond' and 'factors of bondage'..."  
7. The elder bhikkhus confirmed the debate. Citta then asked, "Are these two terms distinct or identical in meaning?" The elders reiterated their views.  
8. Citta proposed an analogy: Suppose a black ox and a white ox are bound by a single rope. One claiming the black ox binds the white ox or vice versa would err. The bondage arises from the rope itself.  
9. Similarly, the eye does not bind forms, nor forms bind the eye. Bondage arises from desire born of their contact. The same applies to ear-sound, nose-smell, tongue-taste, body-touch, mind-mind-objects.  
10. The elders praised Citta’s insight, acknowledging his deep understanding.  

2. Revata (1)  
1. At that time, many elder bhikkhus dwelled at Ambātakavana.  
2. Citta approached, paid homage, and invited them to a meal the next day.  
3. The elders accepted silently.  
4. The next day, they arrived for the meal. Seated, Citta asked the senior elder: "How many diverse elements has the Blessed One described?"  
5. The elder remained silent thrice.  
6. Revata, the youngest, sought permission to answer.  
7. He explained: "The Blessed One spoke of eighteen elements—eye, form, eye-consciousness; ear... mind, mental-objects, mind-consciousness."  
8. Delighted, Citta served them excellent food.  
9. After the meal, the elders praised Revata’s clarity.  

3. Revata (2)  
1. The elder bhikkhus again dwelled at Ambātakavana.  
2. Citta invited them and asked about the sixty-two wrong views from the Brahmajāla Sutta: "What causes such views?"  
3. The elder remained silent thrice. Revata answered: "Identity-view sustains these; without it, they cease."  
4. Citta inquired further on identity-view’s origin. Revata explained unlearned worldlings’ clinging to the five aggregates.  
5. Citta realized Revata’s identity and offered support.  
6. The elders praised Revata’s understanding again.  

4. Mahākoṭṭhita  
1. Elder bhikkhus dwelled at Ambātakavana.  
2. Citta invited them to a meal at a cowshed.  
3. Mahākoṭṭhita, the youngest, summoned cool winds and rain through psychic power.  
4. Astonished, Citta requested a miracle. Mahākoṭṭhita emitted fire through a keyhole, burning grass without harming robes.  
5. Thrilled, Citta offered support, but Mahākoṭṭhita later departed without returning.  

5. Kāmabhū (1)  
1. Kāmabhū dwelled at Ambātakavana. Citta visited and asked about a verse:  
*"Uneroded, white-canopied, one-wheeled, rolling, cutting stream, unbound, harm-free—see the coming one."*  
2. Citta interpreted: "Uneroded" as virtue; "white canopy" as liberation; "one wheel" as mindfulness; "rolling" as movement; "chariot" as the body; "stream" as craving; "unbound" as absence of defilements.  
3. Kāmabhū praised his understanding.  

6. Kāmabhū (2)  
1. Citta asked about bodily, verbal, and mental formations.  
2. Kāmabhū explained: Breath is bodily; investigation-verbal; perception/feeling-mental.  
3. Further questions covered cessation of perceptions/feelings, death vs. attainment, emergence from cessation, and its benefits (tranquility and insight).  

7. Gūḍatā  
1. Gūḍatā explained the four liberations: boundless, nothingness, emptiness, and signless.  
2. Terms differ by context—when defilements are called "measure," the liberations are distinct. But when defilements cease universally, all liberations point to the same liberation (the unshakable).  

8. Nigaṇṭha  
1. Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta challenged Citta’s faith.  
2. Citta described his meditative attainments, proving his insight.  
3. Nigaṇṭha accused him of deceit but was refuted. Citta exposed his inconsistency.  

9. Naked Ascetic  
1. Citta’s old friend, the naked ascetic Kassapa, admitted gaining nothing in 30 years.  
2. Citta revealed his own attainments. Kassapa ordained, achieved arahantship.  

10. View of Illness  
1. Dying, Citta rejected devas’ prophecies of becoming a king.  
2. He taught his kin faith in Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha, and generosity. Concluding, he ensured their conversion.
