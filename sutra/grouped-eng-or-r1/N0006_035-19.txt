4. The Division on the Snake

4.1 The Snake  
1-2. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī. There, he addressed the monks:  
3. "Monks, suppose there were four venomous snakes of great power and deadly poison. A man who loves life, fears death, desires pleasure, and dislikes pain is told: 'Friend, these four venomous snakes of great power and deadly poison must be regularly awakened, bathed, fed, and put back into their holes. If any of these snakes becomes angry with you, you will meet death or deadly suffering. You must do what should be done.'  
4. Then, monks, that man, fearful of the four venomous snakes, flees elsewhere and is told: 'Friend, five murderous enemies are chasing you, seeking to take your life. You must do what should be done.'  
5. Then, monks, fearful of the four snakes and the five enemies, he flees elsewhere and is told: 'Friend, a sixth assassin with a drawn sword is chasing you. He will cut off your head wherever he finds you. You must do what should be done.'  
6. Fearful of the four snakes, five enemies, and the sixth assassin, he flees further and sees an empty village. Entering, he takes some empty utensils and is told: 'Friend, now bandits will raid this empty village. You must do what should be done.'  
7. Fearing all these, he flees again and encounters a great flood. The near shore is dangerous, the far shore safe, yet there is no boat or bridge.  
8. He thinks: 'Let me gather reeds and branches to make a raft. By paddling with hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore.'  
9. He builds the raft and crosses to safety. A brahmin, having crossed, stands on dry land.  
10-21. The Buddha explains the allegory: The four snakes represent the four elements (earth, water, fire, wind). The five enemies are the five aggregates. The sixth assassin is delight and lust. The empty village is the six sense bases. The bandits are the six external senses. The flood is the four torrents (desire, existence, views, ignorance). The near shore is self-view; the far shore is Nibbāna. The raft is the Eightfold Path. Effort is paddling. The brahmin is an arahant.  

4.2 Delight  
3. "Monks, a monk with three qualities dwells in joy here and now and has the conditions for the destruction of the taints. These three are: guarding the sense doors, moderation in eating, and devotion to wakefulness.  
4-8. Guarding the senses is described as not clinging to signs or details of objects. Moderation in eating is for health, not indulgence. Wakefulness involves meditative vigilance day and night.  
9. Such a monk dwells happily and is destined for liberation.  

4.3 The Tortoise  
3. Once, a tortoise foraged at evening. A jackal also hunted.  
4. The tortoise, seeing the jackal, withdrew its limbs into its shell.  
5. The jackal waited for any limb to emerge but failed.  
7-8. Similarly, Māra constantly seeks entry through the senses. Guard the sense doors as the tortoise guards its limbs.  

4.4 The Log (1)  
1-2. The Buddha sees a log floating downstream.  
3-12. He explains allegorically: Not clinging to this shore (internal senses), the far shore (external senses), avoiding desire (stream), conceit (stranding), being seized by humans (social ties), non-humans (celestial ambitions), whirlpools (sensual pleasures), or inner decay (moral corruption). The raft (Eightfold Path) leads to Nibbāna.  
13-18. Nanda the cowherd becomes a monk and attains arahantship.  

4.5 The Log (2)  
Similar to 4.4, with altered details about internal decay.  

4.6 Leakage  
3-18. A discourse on guarding the senses to prevent "leakage" (defilements). Māra gains no foothold when senses are well-guarded.  

4.7 The Afflictive Nature  
3-13. Knowing the rise and fall of suffering, avoiding attachment to desires, and cultivating restraint.  

4.8 The Simile of the Citron  
7-9. The Buddha uses the metaphor of a citron tree (described differently by blind men) to illustrate partial truths. The fortified city with six gates represents the body and senses, leading to Nibbāna via the Eightfold Path.  

4.9 The Lute  
3-5. Restraint of senses compared to controlling cattle.  
6-7. A lute's music arises from many parts; similarly, the self is a composite.  

4.10 The Six Animals  
3-8. The mind, like six animals tied together (snake, crocodile, bird, dog, hyena, monkey), needs the "stake" of mindfulness to restrain sensory distractions.  

4.11 The Sheaf of Barley  
3-12. The fool battered by sensory contacts (like barley threshed) clings to "I am" through various views. Letting go of conceptual proliferation leads to liberation.
