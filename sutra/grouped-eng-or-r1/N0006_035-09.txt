4. The Chapter on Channa  

84 (1) Decline  

2. At that time, Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One's dwelling...  

3. Having sat down to one side, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said ‘the world, the world.’ In what sense is it called ‘the world’?"  

4. "Ānanda, whatever is subject to decline is called ‘the world’ in the Noble One’s discipline. And what is subject to decline?  

5–9. The eye is subject to decline, forms are subject to decline, eye-consciousness is subject to decline, eye-contact is subject to decline. Whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is subject to decline... The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body...  

10. The mind is subject to decline, mental objects are subject to decline, mind-consciousness is subject to decline, mind-contact is subject to decline. Whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is subject to decline.  

11. Ānanda, whatever is subject to decline is called ‘the world’ in the Noble One’s discipline."  

85 (2) Empty  

2–3. At that time, Venerable Ānanda... said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, it is said ‘the world is empty, the world is empty.’ In what sense is it called ‘the world is empty’?"  

4. "Ānanda, it is because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is called ‘the world is empty.’ And what is empty of self and of what belongs to self?  

5–10. The eye is empty of self and of what belongs to self. Forms are empty... Eye-consciousness... Eye-contact... Whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact... The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body... The mind is empty of self and of what belongs to self. Mental objects... Mind-consciousness... Mind-contact... Whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is empty of self and of what belongs to self.  

11. Ānanda, because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self, it is called ‘the world is empty.’"  

86 (3) Brief  

3. Having sat down to one side, Venerable Ānanda... said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I will dwell alone, secluded, diligent, ardent, and resolute."  

4–9. "What do you think, Ānanda: Is the eye permanent or impermanent?"—"Impermanent, venerable sir."—"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"—"Suffering, venerable sir."—"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?"—"No, venerable sir."—"Are forms... eye-consciousness... eye-contact... Whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—permanent or impermanent?"—"Impermanent, venerable sir."—"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"—"Suffering, venerable sir."—"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?"—"No, venerable sir."—"The ear... The nose... The tongue... The body... The mind... Mental objects... Mind-consciousness... Mind-contact... Whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—is that permanent or impermanent?"—"Impermanent, venerable sir."—"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"—"Suffering, venerable sir."—"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?"—"No, venerable sir."  

10. "Ānanda, seeing thus, a learned noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye... disenchanted with mind-contact... disenchanted with whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact. Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is liberated. When liberated, there arises the knowledge: ‘Liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’"  

87 (4) Channa  

1. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.  

2. At that time, Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahācunda, and Venerable Channa were dwelling on Vultures’ Peak.  

3. Then Venerable Channa became sick, afflicted, gravely ill.  

4. In the evening, Venerable Sāriputta rose from meditation, approached Venerable Mahācunda, and said: "Come, friend Cunda, let us visit Venerable Channa."  

5. Having approached Venerable Channa, they sat down on prepared seats.  

6. Venerable Sāriputta said: "Friend Channa, are you improving? Are you comfortable? Are your pains subsiding and not increasing? Do they subside and not increase?"  

7–12. "Friend Sāriputta, there is no improvement. The pains are severe and increasing, not subsiding. Just as a strong man might split my head with a sword... as a cow-butcher might stab my belly with a sharp knife... as two strong men might roast me over a charcoal pit... Friend Sāriputta, bring me a knife. I no longer wish to live."  

13. "Venerable Channa, do not use a knife. Let Venerable Channa live. If you lack suitable food, medicine, or attendants, we will arrange them."  

14. "Friend Sāriputta, I have suitable provisions. But long have I served the Teacher with ease. There is nothing unsuitable left. Please understand, friend Sāriputta, that Channa the monk asks for a knife."  

15. "Let us ask Venerable Channa a few questions."  

16–19. "Friend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye-consciousness, and what is cognizable by eye-consciousness as ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?"—"No, friend Sāriputta."—"How do you see, how do you know?"—"I see cessation, know cessation. No longer do I regard anything thus."  

20. Venerable Mahācunda said: "Therefore, one should constantly consider the Blessed One’s teaching. Where there is clinging, there is instability. Without clinging, there is no instability. Without instability, there is calm. Without calm, there is no coming and going. Without coming and going, there is no passing away and rebirth. Thus is the cessation of suffering."  

21–22. After giving this advice, they departed. Soon after, Venerable Channa cut his own throat.  

23–26. Venerable Sāriputta asked the Blessed One about Channa’s destiny. The Blessed One replied that Channa had no further existence, having attained final Nibbāna.  

88 (5) Puṇṇa  

2–3. Venerable Puṇṇa approached the Blessed One and requested a brief teaching. The Blessed One instructed him on not delighting in the senses.  

4–12. The Blessed One warned Puṇṇa about the hostile people of Soreyya. Puṇṇa resolved to endure any abuse with patience, even death. The Blessed One praised his resolve.  

13–17. Puṇṇa went to Soreyya, taught five hundred lay followers, attained the three knowledges, and passed into Nibbāna. The Buddha confirmed his full liberation.  

89 (6) Bhaddiya  

2–13. Venerable Bhaddiya asked for brief instruction. The Blessed One questioned him on the impermanent, suffering, and non-self nature of the senses. Bhaddiya realized arahantship.  

90 (7) Agitation (1)  

2–9. The Blessed One teaches that agitation is a disease. A monk should not conceive anything through the senses or mind, thus attaining liberation.  

91 (8) Agitation (2)  

Similar to the previous sutta, emphasizing non-conceiving of aggregates, elements, and sense bases.  

92 (9) Dyads (1)  

2–5. The pairs (eye and form, etc.) are called "dyads." Any other claim about dyads leads to confusion.  

93 (10) Dyads (2)  

2–9. Dependent on dyads, consciousness arises. All these are impermanent, leading to suffering and non-self.
