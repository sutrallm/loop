7. Mahāvagga  

61. 1. Aparaññāṇa (1)  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, an unlearned ordinary person becomes disenchanted, dispassionate, and liberated regarding this body composed of the four great elements.  

3. For what reason? Monks, this body composed of the four great elements is seen to increase and diminish, to be taken up and laid down. Therefore, the unlearned ordinary person becomes disenchanted, dispassionate, and liberated regarding it.  

4. Monks, as for what is called ‘mind,’ ‘mentality,’ or ‘consciousness,’ the unlearned ordinary person cannot become disenchanted, dispassionate, or liberated regarding it.  

5. For what reason? Monks, the unlearned ordinary person has long been attached, clung, and bound by the notion, ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ Therefore, regarding this, the unlearned ordinary person cannot become disenchanted, dispassionate, or liberated.  

6. Monks, it is better for the unlearned ordinary person to take this body composed of the four great elements as self rather than the mind.  

7. For what reason? Monks, this body composed of the four great elements is seen to endure for a year, two years... ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years... even a hundred years or more. But what is called ‘mind,’ ‘mentality,’ or ‘consciousness’ arises and ceases night and day, different from what it was.  

8. Monks, just as a monkey roaming through the forest grabs one branch, releases it, and grabs another, so too what is called ‘mind,’ ‘mentality,’ or ‘consciousness’ arises and ceases night and day, different from what it was.  

9. Monks, a learned noble disciple wisely reflects on dependent origination: ‘When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.’ That is: With ignorance as condition, volitional formations [come to be]... Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.  

10. With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations... Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.  

11. Monks, a learned noble disciple becomes disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with volitional formations, disenchanted with consciousness. Being disenchanted, they become dispassionate. Through dispassion, they are liberated. When liberated, there arises the knowledge: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’”  

62. 2. Aparaññāṇa (2)  

1. The Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, an unlearned ordinary person becomes disenchanted, dispassionate, and liberated regarding this body composed of the four great elements.  

3. For what reason? Monks... (as in §3–8 of 61)...  

8. Monks, a learned noble disciple wisely reflects on dependent origination... (as in §9–10 of 61)...  

9. Monks, when a pleasant feeling arises conditioned by a pleasant contact, with the cessation of that pleasant contact, the corresponding feeling—the pleasant feeling born of that pleasant contact—ceases and subsides.  

10. When a painful feeling arises conditioned by a painful contact, with the cessation of that painful contact, the corresponding feeling—the painful feeling born of that painful contact—ceases and subsides.  

11. When a neutral feeling arises conditioned by a neutral contact, with the cessation of that neutral contact, the corresponding feeling—the neutral feeling born of that neutral contact—ceases and subsides.  

12. Monks, just as heat and a flame arise from two sticks being rubbed together, when the sticks are separated, the resulting heat and flame cease.  

13. So too, monks, when a pleasant feeling... (as above)...  

16. Monks, when a learned noble disciple becomes disenchanted with contact, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with consciousness, they become dispassionate. Through dispassion, they are liberated. When liberated, there arises the knowledge: ‘Birth is destroyed... no more coming to any state of being.’”  

63. 3. Puttaṃsa  

1. The Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, there are four nutriments for the sustenance and continuation of beings.  

3. What four? Physical food, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mental volition as the third; consciousness as the fourth. These are the four nutriments.  

4. How should physical food be understood?  

5. Monks, suppose a couple, husband and wife, taking limited provisions, set out on a journey through a desert. They have with them their only beloved son.  

6. While traveling through the desert, their provisions run out, with much of the desert still remaining.  

7. They think: ‘Our provisions are exhausted. The journey is long. If we kill our beloved son, prepare dried and roasted meats, and eat his flesh, we can complete the journey so all three do not perish.’  

8. They then kill their son and eat his flesh, weeping as they go: ‘Where is our son? Where is our only child?’  

9. Monks, do you think they ate their son’s flesh for pleasure, for enjoyment, for nourishment, or merely to survive?”  

“No, Blessed One.”  

10. “Was it solely to cross the desert?”  

“Yes, Blessed One.”  

11. “Monks, physical food should be understood in this way. Whoever indulges in physical food without proper reflection is bound by chains, and the noble disciple will return to this realm.  

12. How should contact-food be understood?  

13. Monks, suppose a skinned cow stands by a wall, tree, or in water; wherever it stands, creatures bite it. Similarly, contact-food is to be understood.  

14. Understanding contact-food, one understands the three feelings. Understanding the three feelings, there is nothing further for a noble disciple to do.  

15. How should mental-volition-food be understood?  

16. Monks, suppose a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals. A person who loves life, avoids pain, is dragged toward it by two strong men.  

17. That person’s mind inclines away, wishes to avoid it, realizing: ‘If I fall into this pit, I will die or suffer deadly pain.’ Similarly, mental-volition-food is to be understood.  

18. Understanding mental-volition-food, one understands the three cravings. Understanding the three cravings, there is nothing further for a noble disciple to do.  

19. How should consciousness-food be understood?  

20. Monks, suppose a thief caught stealing is brought before the king: ‘Sire, punish him as you see fit.’ The king orders: ‘Strike him with a hundred spears in the morning.’  

21. At noon, the king asks: ‘How is he?’ ‘Alive, sire.’ He orders another hundred strikes.  

22. At dusk, again: ‘Alive, sire.’ Another hundred strikes. Would he suffer?”  

“Yes, Blessed One. Even one strike causes suffering; how much more three hundred.”  

23. “Monks, consciousness-food is to be understood thus. Understanding consciousness-food, one understands name-and-form. Understanding name-and-form, there is nothing further for a noble disciple to do.”  

64. 4. Rāga  

1. The Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, there are four nutriments for the sustenance and continuation of beings...  

3. ... (as in 63.3)...  

4. Monks, when there is passion, delight, or craving for physical food, consciousness finds a foothold and increases. With consciousness established and growing, name-and-form manifests. With name-and-form, volitional formations increase. With volitional formations, future rebirth occurs. With rebirth, aging and death arise. Monks, such is the origin of sorrow, lamentation, pain, and despair.  

7. ... Similarly with craving for consciousness-food...  

8. Monks, just as a painter uses dyes to create images on cloth, so too:  

9. With craving for physical food... (as above)...  

10. ... Similarly for contact-food...  

12. ... With craving for consciousness-food, consciousness is established... leading to sorrow, pain, and despair.  

13. Monks, when there is no craving for physical food... consciousness does not increase... ending sorrow, pain, and despair.  

14. ... Similarly for contact-food...  

16. ... Without craving for consciousness-food... consciousness ceases, leading to the end of sorrow, pain, and despair.  

17. Monks, just as light from a palace shines on a western wall, then earth, water, or nowhere if these are absent, so too:  

21. ... Without craving, no consciousness arises... sorrow ceases.”  

65. 5. Nagara  

1. The Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. [The Blessed One said:] “Monks, before my full awakening, I thought: ‘The world is in suffering—birth, aging, death. But the escape from this suffering is not understood.’  

3. ‘With what does aging-and-death exist? What is its origin?’  

4. Wisely reflecting, I understood: ‘Aging-and-death arises with birth as its condition.’  

5. ‘With what does birth exist?... (traces the links upwards)...  

6. ... Name-and-form arises with consciousness as its condition.  

7. ‘With what does consciousness exist?’  

8. ‘Consciousness arises with name-and-form as its condition.’  

9. Thus, they are mutually dependent. The entire mass of suffering originates thus.  

10. Seeing this, knowledge arose: ‘This is the origin.’  

11. ‘With the cessation of birth, aging-and-death ceases.’  

12. ... (reverse links)...  

13. ... With the cessation of consciousness, name-and-form ceases.  

17. Thus, the entire mass of suffering ceases.  

19. Monks, imagine discovering an ancient road leading to a deserted city. One informs the king, who rebuilds it, leading to prosperity.  

20. Similarly, I discovered the ancient path—the Noble Eightfold Path—leading to the cessation of suffering. Following it, one understands aging-death, its origin, cessation, and the path thereto.  

22. ... Following this path, one understands birth... becoming... grasping... craving... feeling... contact... six sense bases... name-and-form... consciousness... volitional formations... ignorance, their cessation.  

33. Monks, proclaiming this Dhamma, the holy life flourishes, people thrive, liberated from suffering.”  

66. 6. Phassa  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Kammāsadhamma, a town of the Kurus.  

2. The Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, do you experience internal contact?”  

3. A monk replied: “I do, Blessed One.”  

4. “How?”  

7. Ānanda requested the Blessed One to explain.  

8. The Blessed One: “When a monk internally contacts: ‘What is the cause of aging-death, its origin, arising? What exists for aging-death to exist?’  

9. He understands: ‘Aging-death arises with birth as its condition. Without birth, aging-death ceases.’ This is right view.  

10. With correct understanding of contact, feeling, and craving’s cessation, one is liberated.  

11–16. ... Exploring sense bases as sources of craving...  

17–22. ... Those who view the world’s delights as permanent foster craving, leading to suffering.  

23–26. ... Like drinking poisoned water despite knowing the danger...  

27–32. Those who see impermanence abandon craving, leading to freedom from suffering.  

33–36. ... Those who avoid poisoned water avoid suffering...  

37–40. Discerning impermanence leads to liberation.”  

67. 7. Nalaka  

1. At one time, Sāriputta and Mahākoṭṭhita were dwelling at Bārāṇasī.  

2. Mahākoṭṭhita asked: “Is aging-death self-made, other-made, both, or neither?”  

4. Sāriputta: “Aging-death is dependently originated, conditioned by birth.”  

5–19. Similar analysis for each link.  

23. Agreeing on mutual dependence, they compare consciousness and name-and-form to two sheaves of reeds supporting each other. Removing one, both fall.  

24–39. ... A monk who teaches cessation through dispassion is a true Dhamma teacher.  

68. 8. Kosambī  

1. At Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Park...  

2. Monkly debates on dependent origination.  

3–27. The elder monks assert direct knowledge of dependent arising without relying on tradition.  

28. One declares: “The cessation of existence is Nibbāna”—yet remains unliberated.  

29–59. Through dialogue, they clarify their understanding is direct insight, not yet full liberation.  

60–61. A simile of water seen but unreachable.  

69. 9. Ogha  

1. The Blessed One said: “When the ocean swells, rivers swell...  

4. Similarly, ignorance swells, causing volitional formations... leading to aging-death.  

5. When the ocean ebbs... ignorance wanes, ending suffering...”  

70. 10. Susīma  

1. At Rājagaha, the monks gain honor, while outsiders do not.  

2–7. Susīma’s disciples urge him to learn the Dhamma and teach.  

8–12. Susīma ordains.  

13–27. Hearing monks claim full liberation without psychic powers, Susīma questions them.  

28–57. The Buddha teaches him on dependent origination and the nature of aggregates.  

58–63. Susīma confesses his fault; the Buddha admonishes, then forgives.  

Thus concludes the Mahāvagga.
