1. [1] The First Extensive Discourse on the Ganges  

[1] The First Discourse on Purity  

1-2.  

At Sāvatthī.  

“Bhikkhus, there are four meditative absorptions. What are the four?  

3.  

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first meditative absorption, which is accompanied by initial thought and sustained thought, filled with the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.  

4.  

With the subsiding of initial thought and sustained thought, he enters and dwells in the second meditative absorption, which is internal clarity and unification of mind, free from initial thought and sustained thought, filled with the rapture and pleasure born of concentration.  

5.  

With the fading away of rapture, he dwells equanimous, mindful, and fully aware, experiencing pleasure through the body. He enters and dwells in the third meditative absorption, of which the noble ones declare: ‘One dwells pleasantly with equanimity and mindfulness.’  

6.  

Having abandoned pleasure and pain, and with the prior disappearance of joy and sorrow, he enters and dwells in the fourth meditative absorption, which is neither painful nor pleasant and is purified by equanimity and mindfulness.  

7.  

Bhikkhus, these are the four meditative absorptions.  

8.  

Bhikkhus, just as the Ganges river flows toward the east, slopes toward the east, and merges into the east, so too, a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the four meditative absorptions flows toward Nirvāṇa, slopes toward Nirvāṇa, and merges into Nirvāṇa.  

Bhikkhus, how does a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the four meditative absorptions flow toward Nirvāṇa, slope toward Nirvāṇa, and merge into Nirvāṇa?  

9.  

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, secluded from sensual desires, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first meditative absorption... the second meditative absorption... the third meditative absorption... the fourth meditative absorption.  

Bhikkhus, in this way, a bhikkhu who cultivates and frequently practices the four meditative absorptions flows toward Nirvāṇa, slopes toward Nirvāṇa, and merges into Nirvāṇa.”  

The First Discourse on Purity in the Meditative Absorptions (End).  

The same method as in the Satipaṭṭhāna (Collection) may be extensively applied.

Summary Verses:  

Six on flowing east,  
Six on flowing to the ocean,  
Totaling twelve in all—  
Thus concludes the Extensive Chapter on the Ganges.
