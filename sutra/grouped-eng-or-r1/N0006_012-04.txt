31. 1. Jātaka  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. Then the Blessed One addressed Venerable Sāriputta: "In the Parāyanas, the questions asked by Ajita state:  

'Those who investigate the Dhamma,  
Learners and ordinary people alike—  
Asked about their practices—  
A friend, explain this to me.'  

Sāriputta, this brief statement should be fully understood in its detailed meaning."  

When this was said, Venerable Sāriputta remained silent.  

3. A second time, the Blessed One addressed Venerable Sāriputta... Venerable Sāriputta remained silent again.  

4. A third time, the Blessed One addressed Venerable Sāriputta: "Sāriputta, in the Parāyanas, the questions asked by Ajita state:  

'Those who investigate the Dhamma,  
Learners and ordinary people alike—  
Asked about their practices—  
A friend, explain this to me.'  

Friend Sāriputta, this brief statement should be fully understood in its detailed meaning." For a third time, Venerable Sāriputta remained silent.  

2.  

5. "Sāriputta, do you see the non-arisen? Sāriputta, do you see the arisen?"  

6. "Venerable sir, one who sees with right wisdom as it truly is, 'This is the arisen,' who sees the arisen with right wisdom, becomes dispassionate, detached, and ceases through the arisen. Who sees with right wisdom, 'Nourishment is its origin,' sees that nourishment is the origin, becomes dispassionate, detached, and ceases through the cessation of nourishment. When nourishment ceases, the arisen ceases. Seeing with right wisdom that 'With the cessation of nourishment, the arisen is subject to cessation,' one becomes dispassionate, detached, and ceases. Venerable sir, this is how one trains."  

7. "Venerable sir, what is a Dhamma investigator? Venerable sir, one sees the arisen as it truly is with right wisdom. Seeing the arisen with right wisdom, one becomes dispassionate, detached, ceases, freed without clinging. Seeing with right wisdom that nourishment is the origin, one becomes dispassionate, detached, ceases, freed without clinging. Seeing with right wisdom that with the cessation of nourishment, the arisen ceases, one becomes dispassionate, detached, ceases, freed without clinging. Venerable sir, this is a Dhamma investigator.  

8. Venerable sir, this is what is stated in Ajita’s questions in the Parāyanas:  

'Those who investigate the Dhamma,  
Learners and ordinary people alike—  
Asked about their practices—  
A friend, explain this to me.'  

Venerable sir, this brief statement is to be understood in this detailed way."  

3.  

9. "Good, Sāriputta, good! Sāriputta, seeing with right wisdom, 'This is the arisen,' seeing with right wisdom, through detachment, dispassion, and cessation.  

10. Sāriputta, what is a Dhamma investigator? Sāriputta, one sees the arisen as it truly is with right wisdom. Seeing this, one becomes dispassionate, detached, ceases, freed without clinging. Seeing with right wisdom, 'Nourishment is its origin,' one becomes dispassionate, detached, ceases, freed without clinging. Seeing with right wisdom that 'With the cessation of nourishment, the arisen ceases,' one becomes dispassionate, detached, ceases, freed without clinging. Sāriputt, this is a Dhamma investigator.  

11. Sāriputt, this is what is stated in Ajita’s questions in the Parāyanas:  

'Those who investigate the Dhamma,  
Learners and ordinary people alike—  
Asked about their practices—  
A friend, explain this to me.'  

Sāriputta, this brief statement is fully explained thus."  

32. 2. Kālārakkhattiya  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī.  

2. Then the bhikkhu Kālārakkhattiya approached Venerable Sāriputta. Having approached, he exchanged greetings and sat to one side.  

3. Sitting to one side, Kālārakkhattiya said to Venerable Sāriputta: "Friend Sāriputta, the bhikkhu Moliya-Phagguna has given up training and returned to lay life."  

"I suppose that venerable one found no solace in this Dhamma and Discipline."  

4. "But does Venerable Sāriputta find solace in this Dhamma and Discipline?"  

"Friend, I have no perplexity."  

5. "What about the future?"  

"Friend, I have no doubt about the future."  

6. Then Kālārakkhattiya rose and approached the Blessed One. He paid homage and sat to one side.  

7. Seated, he said: "Venerable sir, Venerable Sāriputta claims, ‘I have direct knowledge: Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’"  

8. The Blessed One addressed a bhikkhu: "Go, bhikkhu, tell Sāriputta the Teacher calls him."  

9. "Yes, Venerable Sir," the bhikkhu replied and approached Sāriputta.  

10. Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and sat to one side.  

2.  

11. The Blessed One said: "Sāriputta, do you claim, ‘I have direct knowledge: Birth is destroyed... no more coming to any state of being’?"  

"Venerable sir, do not take these terms literally."  

12. "Sāriputta, how should a clansman answer to declare final knowledge rightly? Could such a declaration be made?"  

13. "Venerable sir, I did not speak that way. Those terms do not convey my meaning."  

14. "If asked, ‘How do you know and see to declare thus?’ How would you answer?"  

15. "If asked thus: ‘Friend Sāriputta, how do you know...?’ I would answer:  

16. ‘Friend, with the cessation of its cause, birth ceases. Knowing this, I declare: Birth is destroyed... no more rebirth.’"  

17. "If asked, ‘What is birth’s cause...?’  

18. "‘Existence is the cause...’  

19. "‘Clinging is the cause...’  

20. "‘Craving is the cause...’  

21. "‘Feeling is the cause...’  

22. "‘Contact is the cause...’  

23. "‘The six sense bases are the cause...’  

24. "‘Name-and-form is the cause...’  

25. "‘Consciousness is the cause...’  

26. "‘Volitional formations are the cause...’  

27. "If asked, ‘How do you know feeling is impermanent?’  

28. "‘All feelings are suffering. Knowing this, I do not delight in feeling.’  

29. "Good, Sāriputta! A concise answer: ‘Whatever is felt is suffering.’  

30. "If asked, ‘How do you declare final knowledge?’  

31. "‘Internally liberated, with the ending of clinging, I dwell mindful. Being mindful, no defilements arise, and I do not identify with anything.’  

32. "Good, Sāriputta! This explains the meaning. Those taints of which a monk might speak—I have no doubt they are ended."  

33. The Blessed One rose and entered his dwelling.  

3.  

34. After the Blessed One left, Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus:  

35. "Friends, when the Teacher first questioned me, I was inexperienced. Did he approve of my answers?  

36. "If the Teacher questioned me for a day with different phrases, I could answer for a day.  

37. "If he questioned me for a night...  

38. "A day and night...  

39. "Two days and nights...  

40. "Three...  

41. "Four...  

42. "Five...  

43. "Six...  

44. "Seven days and nights with different phrases, I could answer for seven days and nights."  

4.  

45. Kālārakkhattiya approached the Blessed One and reported Sāriputta’s declaration.  

46. "Bhikkhu, Sāriputta is one who has mastered the Dhamma. If I questioned him for seven days with different phrases, he could answer for seven days."

4. Knowledge of aging-and-death, its origin, cessation, and the path to its cessation.  

5. Knowledge of birth... existence... clinging... craving... feeling... contact... six sense bases... name-and-form... consciousness... volitional formations...  

14. These are the forty-four kinds of knowledge.  

15-31. [Detailed analysis of dependent origination terms]

1. The Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition, volitional formations arise...  

3. "The question, ‘What is aging-and-death, and who experiences it?’ is invalid. Such dual notions as ‘The soul and body are the same or different’ are rejected. The Tathāgata teaches the middle: Dependent on birth, aging-and-death arises...  

14. "With ignorance ceased, formations cease...

38. 8. Intention (1)  

1. "Whatever one intends, plans, or dwells on becomes an object for consciousness.  

2. "With a basis, consciousness establishes... leading to future rebirth and suffering.  

4. "If there is no basis, consciousness does not establish... ending suffering."  

39. 9. Intention (2) [Expands on dependent origination chain via intention]  

40. 10. Intention (3) [Elaborates cessation through non-intention]
