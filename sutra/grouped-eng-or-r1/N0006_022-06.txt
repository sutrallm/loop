1. Chapter on Obstructions  
53. First: Obstruction  
1-2  
[At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...]  
3  
"Bhikkhus, one who is obstructed is not liberated; one who is un-obstructed is liberated."  
4  
"Bhikkhus, if consciousness dwells clinging to form, taking form as its object, rooted in form, anchored in delight, it grows, increases, and expands. So too with feeling... perception... mental formations...  
5  
Bhikkhus, if one says: ‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and mental formations, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its death and rebirth, growth, increase, and expansion’—this is impossible.  
6-10  
Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu abandons lust for the form element, through abandoning lust, the root is cut off, and there is no footing for consciousness. So too with the feeling element... perception element... mental formation element... consciousness element.  
11  
Consciousness, unestablished, not growing, not active, is liberated. Being liberated, it is steady; being steady, it is content; being content, one is not agitated. Unagitated, one attains Nibbāna, knowing: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what was to be done is done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’"  

54. Second: Seeds  
1-2  
[At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...]  
3  
"Bhikkhus, there are five kinds of seeds. What five? Root-seeds, stem-seeds, joint-seeds, bud-seeds, and seed-seeds.  
4  
Bhikkhus, if these five kinds of seeds are unbroken, unspoiled, unharmed by wind and heat, viable, and well-stored, but there is no earth and no water, can these five seeds grow, increase, and expand?"  
"No, Venerable Sir."  
5  
"Bhikkhus, if these five kinds of seeds are broken, spoiled, harmed by wind and heat, non-viable, and poorly stored, but there is earth and water, can they grow?"  
"No, Venerable Sir."  
6  
"Bhikkhus, if these five kinds are unbroken... and there is earth and water, can they grow?"  
"Yes, Venerable Sir."  
7  
"Bhikkhus, the earth element is like the four bases of consciousness; the water element is like delight and lust. The five seeds are like consciousness and nutriment.  
8  
If consciousness dwells clinging to form... So too with feeling... perception... mental formations...  
12  
Bhikkhus, if one says: ‘Apart from form... I will describe consciousness...’—this is impossible.  
13-17  
When a bhikkhu abandons lust for the form element... [continues as §53.6-11]...  
18  
...He attains Nibbāna, knowing: ‘Birth is destroyed...’"  

55. Third: Udāna  
1-2  
[At that time, the Blessed One was dwelling in Savatthi...]  
2  
The Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:  
"Not mine, not I, nothing of self—  
One so discerning cuts the lower fetters."  
3  
A bhikkhu asked: "Venerable Sir, how does one who discerns thus cut the fetters?"  
4-7  
"The uninstructed worldling regards form... as self... does not understand form as impermanent, suffering, non-self, conditioned, and liable to destruction.  
8-15  
But the instructed noble disciple understands form... as impermanent, suffering, non-self, conditioned, and liable to destruction.  
16  
Thus, through dispassion, he is liberated.  
17-31  
[Detailed explanation parallels §§53-54... concluding with]... He attains Nibbāna, knowing: ‘Birth is destroyed...’"  

56. Fourth: Grasping Aggregates  
1-3  
"Bhikkhus, there are five grasping aggregates... To fully understand these with their origin, cessation, and path, I attained enlightenment.  
4-21  
Form... feeling... perception... mental formations... consciousness—each is to be understood, their origin, cessation, and path. The path is the Noble Eightfold Path...  
22-29  
By knowing thus, one is fully liberated."  

57. Fifth: Seven Bases  
1-3  
"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu skilled in seven bases and three examinations is perfected in this Dhamma.  
4-30  
He knows form... feeling... perception... mental formations... consciousness—their origin, cessation, path, allure, danger, and escape.  
31-32  
He examines elements, sense bases, and dependent origination. Such a one is supreme."  

58. Sixth: The Tathāgata  
1-8  
"The Tathāgata is liberated through dispassion toward form... consciousness. A wisdom-liberated bhikkhu is likewise liberated.  
9-11  
The difference? The Tathāgata awakened the unawakened path; disciples follow it."  

59. Seventh: The Five Bhikkhus  
1-2  
At Bārāṇasī, the Blessed One addressed the five bhikkhus:  
3-22  
"Form is non-self... [repeated for feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness]... A noble disciple discerns thus and is liberated."  
23  
Hearing this, the five bhikkhus attained liberation.  

60. Eighth: Mahāli  
1-4  
Mahāli asked: "Does purity come causelessly?"  
5-16  
"No. Forms are pleasant, so beings cling... Through disenchantment, they purify."  

61. Ninth: Burning  
1-5  
"Form is burning... Feeling... Perception... Mental formations... Consciousness is burning. Discerning thus, one is liberated."  

62. Tenth: Designations  
1-19  
"Three designations: past (was), future (will be), present (is). Misapplying these invites criticism. Correct usage avoids it."
