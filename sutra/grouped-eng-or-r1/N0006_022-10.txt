5. Flowers Chapter  

93. First: The River  

1-2. [At that time, the Blessed One] dwelled in Savatthi...  

3. "Bhikkhus, suppose there is a mountain river, flowing swiftly and far, carrying much debris. On its banks grow reeds, which bend and hang into the river. Similarly, grasses, rushes, and fragrant plants grow and hang into the river.  

4. If a person being swept along grabs the reeds, they break, causing them to encounter calamity and suffering. If they grab the grasses... rushes... fragrant plants... or trees, they break, leading to calamity and suffering.  

5. Bhikkhus, so too, the uninstructed ordinary person, who does not see the noble ones, is unskilled in the Dhamma of the noble ones, and untrained in the Dhamma of the noble ones, regards form as self, self as possessing form, form as in self, or self as in form. When that form deteriorates, they encounter calamity and suffering.  

6-8. They regard feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

9. They regard consciousness as self, self as possessing consciousness, consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. When that consciousness deteriorates, they encounter calamity and suffering.  

10. "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Is form permanent or impermanent?"  
"Impermanent, Venerable Sir."  

11-14. "Is feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness permanent or impermanent?"  
"Impermanent, Venerable Sir."  

15. "Bhikkhus, therefore...  

16. Thus seeing... they understand... no longer take on future existence."  

94. Second: Flowers (Growth)  

1-2. [At that time, the Blessed One] dwelled in Savatthi...  

3. "Bhikkhus, I do not dispute with the world; the world disputes with me. Bhikkhus, one who speaks the Dhamma does not dispute with anyone in the world.  

4. Bhikkhus, what the wise in the world declare does not exist, I too declare as nonexistent. What the wise in the world declare exists, I too declare as existent.  

5. Bhikkhus, why do I declare as nonexistent what the wise in the world declare as nonexistent?  

6. Because the wise in the world do not declare form as permanent, stable, eternal, and unchanging. I too declare it as nonexistent.  

7-9. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

10. The wise in the world do not declare consciousness as permanent, stable, eternal, and unchanging. I too declare it as nonexistent.  

11. Bhikkhus, what I declare as nonexistent, the wise in the world also declare as nonexistent.  

12. Bhikkhus, why do I declare as existent what the wise in the world declare as existent?  

13. Because the wise in the world declare form as impermanent, suffering, and subject to change. I too declare it as existent.  

14-16. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

17. The wise in the world declare consciousness as impermanent, suffering, and subject to change. I too declare it as existent.  

18. Bhikkhus, what I declare as existent, the wise in the world also declare as existent.  

19. Bhikkhus, there is a world-phenomenon in the world. The Tathagata has fully awakened to this and teaches it, explaining, establishing, revealing, analyzing, and elucidating it.  

20. Bhikkhus, what is this world-phenomenon that the Tathagata has fully awakened to and teaches?  

21. Form is a world-phenomenon. The Tathagata has awakened to this... Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

25. Consciousness is a world-phenomenon. The Tathagata has awakened to this... Yet there are those who do not know or see this. How can I speak to such foolish, blind, sightless ordinary folk?  

26. Bhikkhus, just as blue, red, or white lotuses are born in water, grow in water, and stand unsoiled by water,  

27. so too, the Tathagata, having grown up in the world, transcends the world and dwells unsoiled by it."  

95. Third: Foam  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling by the Ganges River at Adhivāṭa.  

2. There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:  

3. "Bhikkhus, suppose a great mass of foam is floating on the Ganges. A clear-sighted person observes it thoroughly. Upon examination, they see it as empty, void, and insubstantial. How could there be any substance in foam?  

4. Similarly, bhikkhus, whatever form—past, future, or present... far or near—a bhikkhu observes and thoroughly examines, seeing it as empty, void, and insubstantial. How could there be any substance in form?  

5. Bhikkhus, suppose in autumn, when rain falls, water bubbles arise and burst on the water. A clear-sighted person observes them thoroughly, seeing them as empty... How could there be substance in water bubbles?  

6. Similarly, whatever feeling... is observed...  

7. Bhikkhus, suppose in the last month of summer, at midday, a mirage appears. A clear-sighted person observes it thoroughly...  

8. Similarly, whatever perception...  

9. Bhikkhus, suppose a man needing heartwood searches the forest. He sees a large banana tree, straight, fresh, and without a core. He cuts it down... strips the bark, finding no pith. How could there be substance in a banana tree?  

10. Similarly, whatever volitional formations...  

11. Bhikkhus, suppose a magician or apprentice displays an illusion at a crossroads. A clear-sighted person observes it thoroughly...  

12. Similarly, whatever consciousness...  

14. A learned noble disciple, seeing thus, becomes disenchanted with form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness. Disenchanted, they become dispassionate and liberated."  

15. The Blessed One then spoke these verses:  
(1) Form is like a mass of foam,  
Feeling like a water bubble,  
Perception like a mirage,  
Volitions like a banana tree,  
Consciousness like an illusion—  
So taught the Kinsman of the Sun.  

(2) However one may ponder it  
And carefully investigate,  
It’s void and insubstantial  
To the one who sees it rightly.  

(3) This body is frail,  
As the wise have declared.  
Abandoning three states,  
One should view form as a wisp.  

(4) When life, heat, and consciousness  
Depart from this body,  
The corpse is cast aside,  
Unthinking, food for others.  

(5) Such is this continuity,  
This illusion born of greed.  
A murderer is named—  
Here, substance isn’t found.  

(6) A bhikkhu with energy aroused  
Should inspect the aggregates by day and night.  
Let him discard all fetters  
And strive for the sorrowless state.  

96. Fourth: Cow Dung  

1-2. [At that time, the Blessed One] dwelled in Savatthi... A certain bhikkhu approached...  

3. Seated to one side, he asked the Blessed One:  

4. "Venerable Sir, is there any part of form that is permanent, lasting, eternal, unchanging, and remains just so?"  

5-8. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness.  

9. "Bhikkhu, there is no part of form that is permanent...  

10-13. Similarly for feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness.  

14. Then the Blessed One picked up a small piece of cow dung and said:  

15. "Bhikkhu, even this much of a self-nature that is permanent... does not exist.  

16. If such existed, living the holy life would not lead to the complete ending of suffering. Since it does not, the holy life can end suffering."  

17-29. The Buddha recounts his past life as a king with vast wealth and attendants...  

30-33. Despite all possessions, only a fraction was used.  

40. "All formations have passed away; thus, they are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not self.  

42. Therefore, one should become disenchanted, dispassionate, and liberated from all formations."  

97. Fifth: Fingertip  

1-2. [At that time, the Blessed One] dwelled in Savatthi... A bhikkhu asked:  

4-8. "Venerable Sir, is there any part of form... consciousness that is permanent..."  

9-13. "No part of form... consciousness is permanent..."  

14. The Blessed One placed a speck of dust on his fingertip and said:  

15-19. "Even this much of form... consciousness is impermanent... Hence, the holy life can end suffering."  

20-22. Seeing thus, one is liberated.  

98. Sixth: Pure (Ocean)  

1-2. ...A bhikkhu asked similarly about permanent parts of the aggregates.  

3. The answer parallels the previous sutta.  

99. Seventh: Leashed (1)  

1-2. ...  

3. "Bhikkhus, saṃsāra has no beginning. Beings roam, hindered by ignorance, fettered by craving.  

4-6. Just as the ocean, Mount Sineru, or the earth may perish, the end of suffering is not seen for those fettered.  

7. "Like a dog tied to a post, running around it, so an ordinary person clings to the aggregates as self, circling them and not freed from suffering.  

8. But a noble disciple, seeing the truth, does not cling and is liberated."  

100. Eighth: Leashed (2)  

1-2. ...  

3. Similar to Sutta 99, with the dog staying near the post, illustrating how ordinary people cling to the aggregates.  

4-11. Admonition to observe the mind's defilements and purify it.  

12-14. By seeing the aggregates as impermanent, one is liberated.  

101. Ninth: Adze Handle (Ship)  

1-2. ...  

3. "Bhikkhus, I declare the destruction of taints through knowledge and vision.  

4. By understanding the arising and ceasing of the aggregates, taints end.  

5-16. Without diligently cultivating the path factors, liberation is impossible. With cultivation, it is achieved, likened to a chick hatching from an egg or a worn adze handle.  

17-21. Persistent practice naturally wears away the fetters, like monsoon rains rotting ship lashings.  

102. Tenth: Impermanence (Perception)  

1-2. ...  

3. "Cultivating the perception of impermanence eradicates all defilements.  

4-14. Analogies include a farmer plowing weeds, cutting grass, ripe fruit falling, roof rafters converging, sandalwood fragrance, monarchs, moonlight, and the autumn sun dispelling darkness.  

15-16. By contemplating the aggregates’ arising and passing, one destroys craving, ignorance, and conceit."
