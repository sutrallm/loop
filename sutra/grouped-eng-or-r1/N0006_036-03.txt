3. The One Hundred and Eightfold Division  

21. 1. Sīvaka  

1. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.  

2. Then the wanderer Sīvaka approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly and courteous greetings, and sat down to one side.  

3. Seated to one side, Sīvaka said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, some ascetics and brahmins claim that whatever a person experiences—pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure—is all caused by past actions. How does the Blessed One explain this?"  

4. "Sīvaka, some feelings arise from bile. If one knows a feeling arises from bile due to bile disorders, this can be recognized by oneself and acknowledged as true in the world. Those ascetics and brahmins who claim that all feelings are due to past actions overstep what they personally know and the world’s acknowledgment of truth. Thus, I declare their view to be wrong.  

5. Sīvaka, some feelings arise from phlegm...  

6. Sīvaka, some feelings arise from wind...  

7. Sīvaka, some feelings arise from the union of the three humors (bile, phlegm, wind)...  

8. Sīvaka, some feelings arise from seasonal changes...  

9. Sīvaka, some feelings arise from adverse conditions...  

10. Sīvaka, some feelings arise from sudden attacks...  

11. Sīvaka, some feelings arise from the result of kamma..."  

12. When this was spoken, Sīvaka said: "Excellent, Master Gotama! You have revealed the truth, lifted the veil, and shown the path to the lost. I take refuge in the Blessed One, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower from this day forth for life."  

13. Bile, phlegm, wind, their union, seasons, adversities, sudden attacks, and kammic results make eight.  

22. 2. The One Hundred and Eight  

1. "Monks, I will teach you the method of the One Hundred and Eight. Listen carefully.  

2. What is the method? I explain two kinds of feeling, three, five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, and one hundred and eight.  

3. What are the two feelings? Bodily and mental feelings. These are two.  

4. What are the three? Pleasant, painful, neither-painful-nor-pleasant. These are three.  

5. Five feelings? The faculties of pleasure, pain, joy, sorrow, and equanimity. These are five.  

6. Six feelings? Feeling born of eye-contact, ear... nose... tongue... body... mind-contact. These are six.  

7. Eighteen feelings? Six kinds of joy with reflection, six of sorrow with reflection, six of equanimity with reflection. These are eighteen.  

8. Thirty-six? Six household-related joys, six renunciation-related joys; six household-related sorrows, six renunciation-related sorrows; six household-related equanimities, six renunciation-related equanimities. These are thirty-six.  

9. One hundred and eight? Past thirty-six, future thirty-six, present thirty-six. These are one hundred and eight feelings. This is the method of the One Hundred and Eight."  

23. 3. The Monk  

1. A monk approached the Blessed One...  

2. He asked: "What is feeling? Its origin, cessation, path to cessation? Its attraction, drawback, and escape?"  

3. "Feeling is threefold: pleasant, painful, neutral. Contact is its origin; craving brings it forth. Cessation comes with contact’s end. The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to cessation: right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration. The allure of feeling’s pleasure is its attraction; its impermanent, suffering nature is its drawback. Removing craving is the escape."  

24. 4. Prior Knowledge  

1. "Before awakening, I considered: ‘What is feeling? Its origin, cessation, path, attraction, drawback, escape?’  

2. I realized: The three feelings. Contact originates them; craving leads them. Cessation is contact’s end. The path is the Eightfold Way. The attraction is pleasure; the drawback is impermanence. Abandoning craving is the escape.  

3. This knowledge arose in me: thus I understood."  

25. 5. The Monks  

1. Monks asked the same as above. The Blessed One answered identically to section 23.  

26. 6. Ascetics and Brahmins (1)  

1. "Monks, unless ascetics or brahmins fully understand the origin, cessation, allure, drawbacks, and escape of the three feelings, they are not true ascetics or brahmins.  

2. But those who know these truths are genuine, having attained the goal here and now."  

27. 7. Ascetics and Brahmins (2)  

1. Identical to the preceding section.  

28. 8. Ascetics and Brahmins (3)  

1. "Those who do not know feeling, its origin, cessation, and path are not genuine. Those who know are true ascetics and brahmins."  

29. 9. Pure Delight Without Sustenance  

1. "There are three feelings.  

2. Threefold joy, pleasure, equanimity, and liberation: each with sustenance, without sustenance, and beyond.  

3. Joy with sustenance comes from sensual pleasures. Joy without sustenance arises in meditative jhānas. Superior joy is the arahant’s freedom.  

4. Similarly, pleasure with sustenance is sensual; jhānic pleasure is without sustenance; the arahant’s is supreme.  

5. Equanimity with sustenance is worldly; jhānic equanimity is without sustenance; the arahant’s surpasses both.  

6. Liberation tied to form is with sustenance; formless liberation is without sustenance. The arahant’s liberation is highest."
