6. Kosala  
51. Kosala (1)  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the Kosala country, in a Brahmin village of the Kosalans.  
2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks: ...  
3. "Monks, just as among all animals, the lion, the king of beasts, is declared supreme—being powerful, swift, and courageous—so too, among the factors of enlightenment, the faculty of wisdom is declared supreme, being that which leads to awakening.  
4. Monks, what are the factors of enlightenment?  
5. The faculty of faith is a factor of enlightenment that leads to awakening. The faculty of energy is a factor of enlightenment that leads to awakening. The faculty of mindfulness is a factor of enlightenment that leads to awakening. The faculty of concentration is a factor of enlightenment that leads to awakening. The faculty of wisdom is a factor of enlightenment that leads to awakening.  
6. Monks, just as among all animals, the lion, the king of beasts, is declared supreme—so too, among the factors of enlightenment, the faculty of wisdom is declared supreme, being that which leads to awakening."  

52. Malla (2)  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Mallians, in a Mallian town named Uruvelakappa.  
2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks: ...  
3. "Monks, in a noble disciple who has not yet arisen to noble wisdom, there is no stable establishment of the four faculties, no secure dwelling. But in a noble disciple who has arisen to noble wisdom, there is a stable establishment of the four faculties, a secure dwelling.  
4. Monks, just as in a multi-story building, before the roof is constructed, there is no stable establishment of the rafters, no secure dwelling. But once the roof is constructed, there is a stable establishment of the rafters, a secure dwelling. Similarly, in a noble disciple who has not yet arisen to noble wisdom, there is no stable establishment of the four faculties. But once noble wisdom arises, there is a stable establishment of the four faculties. What are the four? The faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, and the faculty of concentration.  
5. Monks, when a noble disciple possesses wisdom, he dwells evenly in faith, evenly in energy, evenly in mindfulness, and evenly in concentration."  

53. The Learner (3)  
1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Park.  
2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, by what principle does a learner-monk abide in the state of a learner, knowing ‘I am a learner,’ and a perfected one abide in the state of a perfected one, knowing ‘I am a perfected one’?"  
3. "Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One..."  
4. "Monks, there is a principle. By this principle, a learner-monk abides as a learner and knows himself as such. What is this principle?  
5. Here, a learner-monk understands suffering as it truly is, understands the origin of suffering, understands the cessation of suffering, and understands the path leading to the cessation of suffering as it truly is. By this principle, he abides as a learner.  
6. Further, a learner considers: ‘Are there other ascetics or Brahmins who speak truth as the Blessed One does?’ He knows: ‘None other speaks truth as the Blessed One does.’ By this principle, he knows himself as a learner.  
7. A learner knows the five faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. He perceives their goal, superiority, fruit, and culmination, and though not yet fully embodied, he discerns them through wisdom. Thus, he abides as a learner.  
8. A perfected one knows the five faculties embodied, their culmination attained, fully discerned through wisdom. By this, he abides as a perfected one.  
9. A perfected one also knows the six sense faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind—all utterly ceased, never to arise again. By this, he knows himself as a perfected one."  

54. The Footprint (4)  
2. "Monks, just as the footprints of all walking creatures are encompassed by the elephant’s footprint—the elephant’s being supreme due to its size—so too, among the phrases leading to awakening, the faculty of wisdom is supreme.  
3. What are these phrases? The faculty of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.  
4. As the elephant’s footprint towers above all others, so wisdom towers among the phrases leading to awakening."  

55. The Essence (5)  
2. "Monks, just as red sandalwood is declared supreme among fragrant woods, so too, among the enlightenment factors, the faculty of wisdom is supreme.  
3. What are the enlightenment factors? Faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.  
4. As red sandalwood is supreme among fragrances, so wisdom is supreme among enlightenment factors."  

56. Dependence (6)  
1. At Savatthi.  
2. "Monks, a monk depending on one thing cultivates and fully develops the five faculties. What is that one thing? Diligence.  
3. What is diligence? Guarding the mind against defilements and conditions for defilements. By this guarding, the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom are fully developed.  
4. Thus, depending on diligence, a monk cultivates the five faculties."  

57. Brahma (7)  
1. Thus have I heard. Once, when the Blessed One had first attained awakening, he dwelt at Uruvela, by the Nerañjara River, under the Ajapala banyan tree.  
2. The Blessed One contemplated: "One who cultivates the five faculties reaches the deathless. Cultivating faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, or wisdom leads to the deathless."  
3. Then Brahma Sahampati, knowing the Blessed One’s thought, appeared before him and said:  
4. "So it is, Blessed One! Cultivating these five faculties leads to the deathless.  
5. In a past life under Kassapa Buddha, I was a monk named Sahaka. By cultivating these faculties, I was reborn as Brahma Sahampati.  
6. Thus, I know cultivating these faculties leads to the deathless."  

58. Sakalika (8)  
1. Thus have I heard. Once, the Blessed One dwelled at Rajagaha, on Vulture’s Peak.  
2. He asked Sariputta: "Why does a perfected one revere the Tathagata and his teachings supremely?"  
3. Sariputta replied: "Because the Tathagata’s teachings lead to supreme peace."  
4-9. The Blessed One approved, explaining that through cultivating the faculties—faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom—directed toward stillness and awakening, a perfected one reveres the Teacher, Dhamma, Sangha, training, and concentration supremely.  

59. Arising (1)  
1. At Savatthi.  
2. "Monks, cultivating the five faculties causes what is unarisen to arise, except when a Tathagata does not appear.  
3. These five are faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom."  

60. Arising (2)  
1-2. At Savatthi.  
3. "Cultivating the five faculties causes what is unarisen to arise, except when the Well-Gone One is untamed.  
4. These five are faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom."
