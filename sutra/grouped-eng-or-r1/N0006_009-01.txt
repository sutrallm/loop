1.1. Thus have I heard. At one time, a monk was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
1.2. Then, that monk, having left his daily abode, went to a householder's dwelling and gave rise to evil and unwholesome thoughts.  
1.3. At that time, a deity dwelling in that forest, wishing to admonish that monk out of compassion and to arouse beneficial thoughts in him, approached the monk.  
1.4. Approaching, the deity addressed him with a verse:  
"You entered the forest seeking seclusion, yet your mind wanders outward.  
For those who desire annihilation and liberation from craving, the mind becomes tranquil when freed from desire.  
Eliminate dissatisfaction and establish mindfulness. We praise the virtuous.  
The dust of hell is hard to remove; do not carry the defilement of craving.  
Just as a bird shakes off the dust clinging to its body after bathing in sand,  
So too should a monk, with right mindfulness and diligent effort, shake off the dust that clings to him."  
1.5. Then, that monk, being admonished by the deity, became alert and composed.

2.1. At one time, a monk was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
2.2. Then, that monk, having left his daily abode, fell asleep.  
2.3. At that time, a deity dwelling in that forest, wishing to admonish that monk out of compassion and to arouse beneficial thoughts in him, went to where the monk was.  
2.4. Upon arriving, the deity addressed him with a verse:  
"Monk, wake up! Why do you lie asleep?  
What benefit is there in slumber? For one pierced by the poisoned arrow of afflictions,  
How can a troubled person sleep? Having renounced household life out of faith,  
Being homeless, cultivate that faith further. Do not fall into the realm of sleep!"  
2.5. [The monk replied:] "Desires are impermanent and cease; fools are intoxicated by them.  
Having freed myself from bonds and renounced household life without clinging,  
Why do you reproach me for sleeping? Liberated from craving,  
Having transcended ignorance, my wisdom is purified.  
Such a renunciant—why do you reproach me?  
Through insight, ignorance is destroyed; with the exhaustion of defilements,  
There is no sorrow or distress. For one thus emerged from meditation,  
Why do you reproach me? Diligent and unshaken,  
Aspiring to Nirvana, ever vigorously striving,  
Such a renunciant—why do you reproach me?"

3.1. At one time, the Venerable Kasyapa was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
3.2. Then, the Venerable Kasyapa, having left his daily abode, was instructing a hunter.  
3.3. At that time, a deity dwelling in that forest, wishing to admonish the Venerable Kasyapa out of compassion and to arouse beneficial thoughts in him, approached him.  
3.4. Approaching, the deity addressed him with a verse:  
"Approaching a steep mountain, a hunter—unwise and mindless—  
This is not the time for instruction. I see him as a fool.  
He neither understands when spoken to, nor perceives when shown.  
Though you teach him the Dharma, the dull-witted grasp not its meaning.  
Kasyapa, even if you offer light equal to ten fingers,  
He cannot see forms, for he lacks the eye to see."  
3.5. Then, the Venerable Kasyapa, admonished by the deity, became alert.

4.1. At one time, numerous monks were dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
4.2. Then, after completing the three-month rainy season retreat, those monks set out to wander.  
4.3. At that time, a deity dwelling in that forest, missing the sight of those monks, felt sorrow and uttered this verse:  
"Seeing so many empty seats, my heart is now sad.  
Where have the disciples of the Gautama, those eloquent speakers, gone?"  
4.4. Then, another deity replied with a verse:  
"Some to Magadha, some to Kosala,  
Some to Vajji—like deer free from snares,  
The monks, homeless, dwell at ease anywhere."

5.1. At one time, the Venerable Ananda was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
5.2. Then, the Venerable Ananda frequently spoke of household matters.  
5.3. At that time, a deity dwelling in that forest, wishing to admonish the Venerable Ananda out of compassion and to arouse beneficial thoughts in him, approached him and said:  
"Having entered the forest to dwell beneath trees, absorbed in Nirvana,  
The Gautama meditates. Do not be negligent,  
Engaging in idle chatter—what use is it to you?"  
5.4. Then, the Venerable Ananda, admonished by the deity, became alert.

6.1. At one time, the Venerable Anuruddha was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
6.2. Then, his former wife, now a deity in the Tavatimsa heaven named Jarini, approached the Venerable Anuruddha.  
6.3. Approaching, she addressed him with a verse:  
"Come, dwell here. Possessed of all sensual delights,  
Arouse your aspirations and be born in the Tavatimsa heaven.  
Embraced by celestial nymphs, surrounded by radiant splendor."  
6.4. [Anuruddha replied:] "Clinging to the view of self—a disaster!  
The gains of celestial nymphs bring ruin to people."  
6.5. [Jarini:] "The world praises the abodes of Tavatimsa.  
Not seeing the Gardens of Delight, you know not happiness."  
6.6. [Anuruddha:] "Foolish one, you do not comprehend  
The Buddha's teaching: all conditioned things are impermanent,  
Subject to arising and ceasing. Their pacification alone  
Is true happiness. Jarini, I have no interest in celestial realms.  
Transcending this cycle, for me there will be no further rebirth."

7.1. At one time, the Venerable Nagadatta was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
7.2. Then, the Venerable Nagadatta would enter the village early in the morning and return late to the forest.  
7.3. At that time, a deity dwelling in that forest, wishing to admonish him out of compassion and to arouse beneficial thoughts in him, approached and said:  
"Friend Nagadatta, you enter the village too early,  
Returning late to the forest. Mingling with householders,  
Sharing their joys and sorrows—O Nagadatta,  
I fear your boldness. Associating with householders,  
The powerful King of Death may lead you to Mara's domain."  
7.4. Then, the Venerable Nagadatta, admonished by the deity, became alert.

8.1. At one time, a monk was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
8.2. Then, that monk frequently stayed in households.  
8.3. At that time, a deity dwelling in that forest, wishing to admonish him out of compassion, assumed the form of a housewife and approached the monk.  
8.4. Approaching, the deity addressed him with a verse:  
"On riverbanks or at city gates,  
In assembly halls or marketplaces—  
People privately discuss you and me. Why is this?"  
8.5. [The monk replied:] "The world abounds in harsh words.  
An ascetic endures them, neither aggrieved nor pained.  
Like a deer startled by the wind's rustle in the forest,  
If one's mind is unsettled, practice bears no fruit."

9.1. At one time, a Vajjian monk was dwelling in a dense forest near Vesali.  
9.2. Then, Vesali held an all-night festival.  
9.3. Hearing the clamor of music and singing, the monk sighed and uttered:  
"If one abandons forest timber to dwell alone in the woods,  
On such a night as this, who could be happier than us?"  
9.4. At that time, a deity dwelling in that forest, wishing to admonish him, approached and said:  
"Though you abandon forest timber and dwell alone,  
Many envy you—like those in hell envying the celestial."  
9.5. Then, the monk, admonished by the deity, became alert.

10.1. At one time, a monk was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
10.2. Previously, he diligently recited scriptures but now sat silently.  
10.3. A deity, missing his recitations, approached and said:  
"Monk, why no longer recite Dharma verses with fellow monks?  
Hearing them brings joy and earns present praise."  
10.4. [The monk replied:] "Through dispassion, words led to the goal.  
Now, through detachment, what is heard or pondered  
Is relinquished by wisdom. The wise are thus taught."

11.1. At one time, a monk was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
11.2. Then, he gave rise to unwholesome thoughts: sensual, malicious, harmful.  
11.3. A deity admonished him:  
"Intoxicated by unwholesome thoughts through wrong reflection,  
Abandon wrong thinking, cultivate right reflection.  
Do not regress in faith toward Teacher, Dharma, Sangha.  
Attain joy and certainty. From joy,  
Multiplying happiness, exhaust all suffering."  
11.4. Then, the monk became alert.

12.1. At one time, a monk was dwelling in a dense forest in the Kosala country.  
12.2. A deity approached him and said:  
"At the sun's zenith, birds perch silently.  
The vast forest resounds—terror strikes me!"  
12.3. [The monk replied:] "At the sun's zenith, birds perch silently.  
The vast forest resounds—my heart brims with joy."

13.1. At one time, many monks in Kosala's forest were restless, scattered, talkative, heedless, unfocused, with unrestrained senses.  
13.2. A deity admonished them:  
"Former disciples dwelled in bliss,  
Without seeking alms, knowing the world's impermanence,  
They ended suffering. Now monks, harming themselves,  
Like village chiefs, minds ensnared by others' wealth,  
Eat, sleep, neglect the Sangha.  
These corpses without masters, to the negligent I say:  
Be vigilant. My refuge is in those who dwell thus."  
13.3. The monks became alert.

14.1. At one time, a monk in Kosala's forest sniffed red lotus fragrance after meals.  
14.2. A deity admonished him:  
"You steal the scent of water-born flowers!"  
14.3. [The monk:] "I neither pluck nor break them.  
Why accuse me of theft? Those who uproot or consume them—  
Why not accuse them?"  
14.4. [Deity:] "A soiled servant's stain is insignificant.  
But a pure one's slightest fault looms large."  
14.5. [Monk:] "I know you, Yakkha, and your compassion.  
Now admonished, I heed your words."  
14.6. [Deity:] "I rely not on you. Monk, know thyself:  
How to proceed toward the good."  
14.7. The monk became alert.
