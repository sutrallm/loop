5. Chapter on Old Age  

[41] 1. Old Age  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in the Eastern Park, at the mansion of Migāra’s mother.  

2. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and sat down in the western warming area to warm his back.  

3. Then Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, massaged the Blessed One’s hands and feet, and said:  

“It is wonderful, Venerable Sir! It is marvelous, Venerable Sir! The Blessed One’s complexion is no longer clear and radiant, his limbs are slack and wrinkled, his body is bent forward, and his sense faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—are altered.”  

4. “So it is, Ānanda. In youth, there is aging; in health, there is sickness; in life, there is death. The complexion is not clear and radiant, the limbs are slack and wrinkled, the body is bent forward, and the sense faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—are altered.”  

5. Having said this, the Blessed One, the Teacher, further spoke:  

Wretched is old age, pitiable,  
Ugliness transforming the once lovely.  
The transient, delightful form  
Is destroyed by aging.  
Even if one lives a hundred years,  
Death’s end cannot be escaped.  
Aging spares none;  
All beings are destroyed.  

[42] 2. Verañja the Brahmin  

1. At Sāvatthī.  

2. Then Verañja the Brahmin approached the Blessed One. After exchanging friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side and said:  

3. “Master Gotama, the five faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—each have separate domains, separate experiences, and do not partake in one another’s domains. What is their refuge? What experiences their objects?”  

4. “Brahmin, the five faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—each have separate domains, separate experiences, and do not partake in one another’s domains. The mind is their refuge. The mind experiences their objects.”  

5. “Master Gotama, what is the refuge of the mind?”  
“The mind has mindfulness as its refuge.”  

6. “Master Gotama, what is the refuge of mindfulness?”  
“Mindfulness has liberation as its refuge.”  

7. “Master Gotama, what is the refuge of liberation?”  
“Liberation has Nibbāna as its refuge.”  

8. “Master Gotama, what is the refuge of Nibbāna?”  
“Brahmin, you have gone beyond questioning. Nibbāna is the culmination of the holy life, the goal, the end.”  

9. Delighted, Verañja the Brahmin rose, paid homage, and departed.  

10. After his departure, the Blessed One addressed the monks:  

11. “Monks, just as sunlight entering through an eastern window in a peaked hall falls on the western wall, so too, Verañja the Brahmin has unshakable confidence in the Tathāgata, rooted and firm, which cannot be undone by any ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā. If he died now, he would be free from bonds and not return to this world.”  

[43] 3. Sāketa  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa in the Añjana Grove.  

2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks:  

“Monks, there is a way where the five faculties are the five powers, and the five powers are the five faculties.”  

3-5. The monks requested clarification. The Blessed One explained:  

“Faith as a faculty is faith as a power; energy as a faculty is energy as a power; mindfulness as a faculty is mindfulness as a power; concentration as a faculty is concentration as a power; wisdom as a faculty is wisdom as a power.  

Just as a river flows eastward, divided by an island into two streams (north and south), yet remains one.  

6-9. Thus, the five faculties and powers are the same in essence. Monks, cultivating these leads to the destruction of defilements, liberation, and the end of rebirth.”  

[44] 4. The Eastern River  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī by the Eastern River.  

2. The Blessed One asked Ven. Sāriputta:  

3-4. “Can faith and other faculties, when cultivated, lead to deathlessness?”  

Ven. Sāriputta affirmed that one must know and see the truth to attain this.  

5. The Blessed One praised his answer, reiterating that mere faith without direct knowledge cannot lead to the deathless.  

[45] 5. Eastern Park (1)  

1. At Sāvatthī’s Eastern Park, the Blessed One taught:  

3-5. Cultivating the wisdom faculty alone leads to liberation, as wisdom enables faith, energy, mindfulness, and concentration to mature.  

[46] 6. Eastern Park (2)  

3-5. Cultivating wisdom and liberation (equated with concentration) leads to liberation.  

[47] 7. Eastern Park (3)  

3-5. Cultivating energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom ends rebirth.  

[48] 8. Eastern Park (4)  

3-5. Cultivating all five faculties (faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom) leads to liberation.  

[49] 9. Piṇḍola  

2-7. Venerable Piṇḍola was liberated through cultivating mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, with liberation’s end being the cessation of birth and death.  

[50] 10. Faith  

2-14. Faith in the Tathāgata, when developed with energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, leads to direct knowledge of the Dhamma and liberation, confirming faith as the root faculty.  

Summary of this chapter: Old Age, Verañja, Sāketa, Eastern River, four sections at the Eastern Park, Piṇḍola, and Faith make ten.
