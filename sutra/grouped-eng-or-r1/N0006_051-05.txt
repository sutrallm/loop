5. The Chapter on Heedfulness  
[45-54] 1-10.  

2. Bhikkhus, for beings without feet... up to those with four feet... and so on. This should be expounded in detail.  

The verse summary says:  
The Tathāgata and the footprint,  
The roof peak, roots, and heartwood,  
The flowers of summer, the king, the moon,  
The sun, the cloth, and so on—these ten phrases.  

Through spiritual power, the Chapter on Heedfulness should be expounded in detail.  
End of the Fifth Chapter.
