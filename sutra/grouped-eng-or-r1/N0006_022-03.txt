3. The Burden Chapter  

22. 1. The Burden  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, I will teach you the burden, the carrier of the burden, the taking up of the burden, and the putting down of the burden. Listen carefully.  

4. Monks, what is the burden? It should be said: the five aggregates affected by clinging. What five? The form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate... the perception aggregate... the volitional formations aggregate... the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. Monks, this is called the burden.  

5. Monks, who is the carrier of the burden? It should be said: the person, the venerable one of such a name and clan.  

6. Monks, what is the taking up of the burden? It is the craving that leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there—that is, sensual craving, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. Monks, this is called the taking up of the burden.  

7. Monks, what is the putting down of the burden? It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that very craving, its abandoning, relinquishment, release, and non-attachment. Monks, this is called the putting down of the burden."  

8. The Blessed One spoke thus. Having spoken, the Teacher, the Well-Gone One, further said:  

(1) The burden is the five aggregates;  
The carrier of the burden is the person.  
Taking up the burden is suffering in the world;  
Putting down the burden is bliss.  

(2) Having put down the heavy burden,  
Not taking up another burden,  
Uprooting craving with its root,  
One is free from hunger, fully quenched.  

23. 2. Full Understanding  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, I will teach what is to be fully understood and full understanding. Listen carefully.  

4. Monks, what is to be fully understood? Form is to be fully understood, feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness is to be fully understood. Monks, this is called what is to be fully understood.  

5. Monks, what is full understanding? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion. Monks, this is called full understanding."  

24. 3. Full Understanding (Realization)  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, if one does not directly know, fully understand, become dispassionate toward, and abandon form, one cannot destroy suffering.  

4-6. If one does not directly know feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

7. If one does not directly know, fully understand, become dispassionate toward, and abandon consciousness, one cannot destroy suffering.  

8-11. Monks, if one directly knows form... feeling... perception... volitional formations...  

12. If one directly knows, fully understands, becomes dispassionate toward, and abandons consciousness, one can destroy suffering."  

25. 4. Desire and Lust  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, abandon desire and lust for form! By abandoning form, one cuts it off at the root, like an uprooted palm tree, obliterated so it cannot arise again.  

4. Abandon desire and lust for feeling...  

5. Abandon desire and lust for perception...  

6. Abandon desire and lust for volitional formations...  

7. Abandon desire and lust for consciousness! By abandoning consciousness, one cuts it off at the root, like an uprooted palm tree, obliterated so it cannot arise again."  

26. 5. Gratification (1)  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, before my awakening, when I was still a bodhisatta, I thought:  

4. 'What is the gratification of form? What is its danger? What is the escape? What is the gratification of feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness? What is its danger? What is the escape?'  

5. Monks, I considered:  

6. 'The pleasure and joy arising from form—this is its gratification. Form is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change—this is its danger. Removing and abandoning desire and lust for form—this is the escape.  

7-9. [Similarly for feeling, perception, volitional formations...]  

10. The pleasure and joy arising from consciousness—this is its gratification. Consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change—this is its danger. Removing and abandoning desire and lust for consciousness—this is the escape.  

11. Monks, until I fully understood the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escape regarding these five aggregates affected by clinging, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, and brahmins, its populace of devas and humans.  

12. But when I fully understood the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escape regarding these five aggregates, I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment...  

13. Knowledge and vision arose in me: 'My liberation is unshakable. This is my last birth. There is no renewed existence.'"  

27. 6. Gratification (2)  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, I sought the gratification of form. Having found it, I clearly saw with wisdom the gratification of form.  

4. I sought the danger of form...  

5. I sought the escape from form...  

6-14. [Similarly for feeling, perception, volitional formations...]  

15-17. I sought the gratification of consciousness...  

18-19. Until I fully understood gratification, danger, and escape regarding these five aggregates...  

20. Knowledge and vision arose in me: 'My liberation is unshakable. This is my last birth. There is no renewed existence.'"  

28. 7. Gratification (3)  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, if there were no gratification in form, beings would not become enamored with it. But because there is gratification in form, beings become enamored.  

4. If there were no danger in form, beings would not become disenchanted with it...  

5. If there were no escape from form, beings would not escape from it...  

6-14. [Similarly for feeling, perception, volitional formations...]  

15. If there were no gratification in consciousness...  

16. If there were no danger in consciousness...  

17. If there were no escape from consciousness...  

18. Monks, as long as beings do not fully understand gratification as gratification, danger as danger, and escape as escape regarding these five aggregates, they have not escaped from this world with its gods, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, brahmins, devas, and humans.  

19. But when beings fully understand these, they escape and are liberated."  

29. 8. Delight  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, one who delights in form delights in suffering. One who delights in suffering is not freed from suffering.  

4-7. [Similarly for feeling, perception, volitional formations, consciousness...]  

8-12. One who does not delight in form... does not delight in suffering. One who does not delight in suffering is freed from suffering."  

30. 9. Arising  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, when form arises, persists, and originates, suffering arises, diseases persist, and aging-and-death originate.  

4-6. [Similarly for feeling, perception, volitional formations...]  

7. When consciousness arises... suffering arises...  

8-12. When form ceases... suffering ceases..."  

31. 10. Origin of Suffering  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, I will teach suffering and the origin of suffering. Listen carefully.  

4. Monks, what is suffering? Form is suffering, feeling... perception... volitional formations... consciousness is suffering. Monks, this is called suffering.  

5. Monks, what is the origin of suffering? It is the craving leading to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there—sensual craving, craving for existence, craving for non-existence. Monks, this is called the origin of suffering."  

32. 11. The Perishable  

1-2. [At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi...]  

3. "Monks, I will teach the perishable and the imperishable. Listen carefully.  

4. Monks, what is the perishable, and what is the imperishable?  

5. Form is perishable. Its cessation, subsiding, and passing away is the imperishable.  

6. Feeling...  

7. Perception...  

8. Volitional formations...  

9. Consciousness is perishable. Its cessation, subsiding, and passing away is the imperishable."
