3. The Section on the Precepts (Dwelling)  

[21] 1. The Precept  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the venerable Ananda and the venerable Bhadda were dwelling in Pataliputta, at the Cock's Grove Monastery.  

2. In the evening, the venerable Bhadda rose from seclusion, approached the venerable Ananda, and exchanged greetings and courteous conversation. Having done so, he sat to one side and said:  

3. "Friend Ananda, the Blessed One spoke of virtuous precepts as 'excellent.' For what reason did he call them excellent?"  

"Good, good, friend Bhadda! Your inquiry is timely. You ask: 'Friend Ananda, for what reason did the Blessed One call virtuous precepts excellent?'"  

"Yes, friend."  

4. "Friend Bhadda, the Blessed One declared virtuous precepts as excellent because they cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness. What are the four?  

5. Here, a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, subduing worldly greed and distress. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings... mind in mind... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, subduing worldly greed and distress. Friend Bhadda, the Blessed One called virtuous precepts excellent because they cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness."  

[22] 2. Dwelling  

1. The same setting.  

2. ... Sitting to one side, the venerable Bhadda asked the venerable Ananda:  

3. "Friend Ananda, what causes the true Dhamma not to endure long after the Tathagata's final Nirvana? And what causes it to endure long?"  

"Good, friend Bhadda! Your question is apt. You ask: 'What causes the Dhamma to not endure or endure long after the Tathagata's Nirvana?'"  

"Yes, friend."  

4. "Friend, when the four establishments of mindfulness are not cultivated and developed, the Dhamma does not endure. When they are cultivated and developed, it endures. What are the four?  

5. A monk dwells contemplating the body in the body... feelings... mind... phenomena, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, subduing worldly greed and distress. Without cultivating these, the Dhamma declines. With cultivation, it endures."  

[23] 3. Decline  

1–2. At Cock's Grove Monastery in Pataliputta.  

3. "Friend Ananda, what causes the decline or non-decline of the Dhamma?"  

"Friend, when the four establishments of mindfulness are neglected, the Dhamma declines. When practiced, it thrives. What are they?  

4–5. A monk dwells contemplating body... feelings... mind... phenomena, subduing greed and distress. Neglect leads to decline; cultivation prevents it."  

[24] 4. Purification  

1. At Savatthi.  

2. "Monks, there are four establishments of mindfulness. Which four?  

3. A monk dwells contemplating body... feelings... mind... phenomena, ardent, mindful, subduing greed and distress. These purify beings and overcome sorrow."  

[25] 5. The Brahmin  

1. At Savatthi's Jeta Grove.  

2. A brahmin asked the Blessed One: "Why does the Dhamma not endure after your Nirvana?"  

4–5. "Brahmin, the Dhamma endures when the four establishments of mindfulness are practiced: contemplating body... feelings... mind... phenomena, subduing greed and distress. Without them, it fades."  

6. The brahmin declared: "Excellent! I take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha."  

[26] 6. Partially  

1–2. At the Sandalwood Grove in Saketa.  

3. "Friends, a learner is one who practices part of the four establishments: contemplating body... feelings... mind... phenomena, subduing greed and distress."  

[27] 7. Fully  

1–2. The same setting.  

3. "An adept has fully cultivated the four establishments: body... feelings... mind... phenomena, subduing greed and distress."  

[28] 8. The World  

1–2. The same setting.  

3. "Friend, great direct knowledge arises from fully cultivating the four establishments. By this, I surpassed a thousand worlds."  

[29] 9. Sirivaddha  

1. At Rajagaha’s Bamboo Grove.  

3–5. Sirivaddha, gravely ill, sent for Ananda.  

6–8. Ananda taught him the four establishments. Sirivaddha replied: "I practice these and have severed the five lower fetters."  

9. Ananda declared: "You are blessed, a non-returner."  

[30] 10. Manadinna  

1–6. Similarly, the householder Manadinna, though suffering, practiced the four establishments and severed the fetters.  

7–8. Ananda confirmed his non-return.
