3. Various Heretics Section  

21. 1. Siva  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. Then, the deity Siva, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove with his radiant light, approached the Blessed One in the early dawn. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.  

2. Standing to one side, the deity Siva recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One: "Associate only with the virtuous, sit only with the virtuous. Knowing the noble Dhamma of the virtuous, do good, not evil. Associate only with the virtuous, sit only with the virtuous. Knowing the noble Dhamma of the virtuous, wisdom is not gained through others. Associate only with the virtuous, sit only with the virtuous. Knowing the noble Dhamma of the virtuous, sorrowless among the sorrowful. Associate only with the virtuous, sit only with the virtuous. Knowing the noble Dhamma of the virtuous, shine among kinsmen. Associate only with the virtuous, sit only with the virtuous. Knowing the noble Dhamma of the virtuous, beings fare well. Beings attain happiness."  

3. Then the Blessed One replied to the deity Siva with a verse: "Associate only with the virtuous, sit only with the virtuous. Knowing the noble Dhamma of the virtuous, one is released from all suffering."  

22. 2. Samana  

1. Standing to one side, the deity Samana recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One: "The fool lacking wisdom, acting as his own enemy, commits evil deeds that yield bitter fruits. Not performing the good, in the end he grieves, wailing with tearful face, experiencing the fruit of his deeds. If one does good, having done it, he does not grieve. With joy and delight, he experiences its pleasant fruit. The wise and noble, understanding for themselves, prepare their deeds thoughtfully, not heedless like a cart-driver. Just as a cart-driver, abandoning the smooth road, enters uneven ground, breaking the axle and lamenting, so the lazy, practicing wrongly, fall into Mara’s jaws, like the broken axle."  

23. 3. Worldly Truth  

1. Standing to one side, the deity Worldly Truth addressed the Blessed One with a verse: "Both devas and humans delight in food. Yet some dislike food. What being is this?"  

2. The Blessed One: "Those who give with faith and a pure mind, offering food as alms, obtain food both in this world and the next. Therefore, subduing stinginess, give wisely, overcoming defilements. Meritorious deeds are humanity’s refuge in the hereafter."  

3. The deity said: "It is wonderful, Blessed One! Truly, the Blessed One has well declared: Those who give with faith and a pure mind... Meritorious deeds are humanity’s refuge in the hereafter."  

4. "In the past, Blessed One, I was a king named Worldly Truth, a generous donor and advocate of giving. At the four gates, I gave to ascetics, brahmins, the poor, travelers, the homeless, and beggars.  

5. Then, my consorts said: ‘Your Majesty gives, but we do not. If we too could share in this merit by giving, how good that would be!’ I thought: ‘I am a donor and advocate of giving. How should I deny those who wish to give?’ So I assigned the first gate to my consorts. Their giving surpassed mine.  

6. Then my attendants, the Kshatriyas, said: ‘Your Majesty and the consorts give, but we do not. If we too could share in this merit...’ I assigned the second gate to them. Their giving surpassed mine.  

7. Then the army requested... I assigned the third gate to them. Their giving surpassed mine.  

8. Then brahmin householders requested... I assigned the fourth gate to them. Their giving surpassed mine.  

9. Later, people said: ‘Now the king gives nothing!’ I declared: ‘Half the kingdom’s revenue shall go to the palace, half to be given to ascetics, brahmins, the poor, travelers, the homeless, and beggars.’  

10. Blessed One, this merit and good conduct, long practiced, has no end. The fruits of these deeds will endure in heaven.  

11. It is wonderful! Truly, the Blessed One has well declared: Those who give with faith and a pure mind... Meritorious deeds are humanity’s refuge in the hereafter."  

24. 4. The Potter  

1. Standing to one side, the deity Potter recited in the Blessed One’s presence: "Seven monks, liberated, born in the Aviha realm, have destroyed lust and hatred, transcended worldly attachments, crossed Death’s domain. Who, discarding this human form, abandons even the celestial yoke? Upaka, Palaganda, Bhaddiya, Pakudha, Sabhiya, these renounced human form, freed from celestial bonds."  

2. The Blessed One: "How subtly you speak of escaping Mara’s snares. By whose Dhamma did they sever existence’s bonds?"  

3. The Potter: "None other than the Blessed One’s Dhamma, none other than his teaching. They knew this Dhamma and severed existence’s bonds. Name and form ceased in them; in this world, they cut existence’s bonds."  

4. The Blessed One: "Deep are your words. By knowing whose Dhamma do you speak thus?"  

5. The Potter: "In a past life, I was a potter in Rajagaha, supporting my parents. In the time of Kassapa Buddha, I was a lay follower, celibate and desireless. Those seven monks were once my companions. Lust and hatred destroyed, they transcended worldly attachments."  

6. The Blessed One: "Just so, Bhagava, you speak. Formerly a potter, celibate and pure, you were my friend."  

7. "Through long practice, we meet now as former friends, both in our final existence."  

25. 5. Jantu  

1. Thus have I heard. Once, many monks dwelt in a forest hut in the Kosala country. They were restless, arrogant, talkative, heedless, lacking clear comprehension, unruly, with senses unrestrained.  

2. The deity Jantu approached them on the Uposatha day and recited: "Formerly, Gotama’s disciples lived content, begging without craving. Knowing the world’s impermanence, they ended suffering. Now monks, craving wealth, eat and sleep like village heads. No reverence in the Sangha, neglected like corpses. To the heedless I speak; I take refuge in the vigilant."  

26. 6. Rohitassa  

1. The deity Rohitassa asked: "Can one reach the world’s end by traveling where there is no birth, decay, death, or rebirth?"  

2. The Blessed One: "I declare no one reaches that end by traveling. Yet without reaching the world’s end, suffering’s end is found. In this fathom-long body, with its perceptions and mind, lie the world, its origin, cessation, and the path."  

3. "Traveling, one finds not the world’s end. Without reaching it, suffering is not transcended. Therefore, the wise, knowing the world’s end, live the holy life. Calmed, they conquer rebirth, desiring nothing here or hereafter."  

27. 7. Nanda  

1. The deity Nanda recited: "Time flies, nights pass. Youth decays. Seeing death’s terror, perform merits for pleasure."  

2. The Blessed One: "Time flies, nights pass. Youth decays. Seeing death’s terror, seek peace, abandoning desires."  

28. 8. Nandivisala  

1. The deity Nandivisala recited: "Four-wheeled, nine-doored, filled with filth, bound by greed—how escape this foul heap?"  

2. The Blessed One: "Cutting greed’s cords, uprooting craving’s root—thus one escapes."  

29. 9. Susima  

1. In Savatthi, the Blessed One asked Ananda: "Do you approve of Sariputta?"  

2. Ananda praised Sariputta’s virtues.  

3. Susima, surrounded by deities, approached and extolled Sariputta.  

4. The Blessed One confirmed Sariputta’s excellence.  

5. Susima and his retinue shone with radiant light, like gems, gold, stars, or the sun.  

6. Susima recited: "Free from anger, modest, gentle, disciplined—wise Sariputta, beacon of the Sangha."  

7. The Blessed One replied: "Free from anger, modest, gentle, disciplined—wise Sariputta, renowned, awaits final peace."  

30. 10. Various Heretics  

1. At Rajagaha, deities approached the Blessed One, illuminating the Bamboo Grove.  

2. Asama praised Purana Kassapa; Sappaka questioned Makkhali; Ninka lauded Nigantha Nataputta; Akotaka asked about various teachers; Vetambari condemned them as jackals; Mara claimed ascetics seek heaven.  

3. The Blessed One declared: "Whatever glitters in the world, the sage rejects them all, like fish abandoning bait."  

4. Manovaddha praised the Buddha as supreme in worlds and heavens.
