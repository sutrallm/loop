2. "Bhikkhus, there are five faculties. What five? The faculty of pleasure, the faculty of pain, the faculty of joy, the faculty of distress, the faculty of equanimity.  

3. Bhikkhus, because a bhikkhu understands as it really is the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape regarding these five faculties, and is liberated through non-clinging, he is called an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, and is liberated through final knowledge."

2. "Bhikkhus, there are five faculties. What five? The faculty of pleasure, the faculty of pain, the faculty of joy, the faculty of distress, the faculty of equanimity.  

3. Bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who do not understand as it really is the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape regarding these five faculties—these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins. These venerables do not, in this very life, realize for themselves with direct knowledge the goal of asceticism or brahminhood, and do not dwell having attained it.  

4. But those ascetics and brahmins who do understand as it really is the origin, cessation, gratification, danger, and escape regarding these five faculties—these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins.

These venerables do not, in this very life, realize for themselves with direct knowledge the goal of asceticism or brahminhood, and do not dwell having attained it."

3. Bhikkhus, when a pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact producing pleasure, one knows: 'This is pleasant.' When that contact producing pleasure ceases, one knows: 'The pleasant feeling arisen from that contact ceases and subsides.'  

4. When a painful feeling arises dependent on a contact producing pain, one knows: 'This is painful.' When that contact producing pain ceases, one knows: 'The painful feeling arisen from that contact ceases and subsides.'

40. 10. Arising  

2. "Bhikkhus, there are five faculties. What five? The faculty of pleasure, the faculty of pain, the faculty of joy, the faculty of distress, the faculty of equanimity.  

3. When a bhikkhu dwells diligently, ardently, and resolutely, and the faculty of pain arises in him, he understands: 'This faculty of pain has arisen in me. It has a condition, a cause, an origination, a dependence. An unconditioned, causeless, originationless, independent faculty of pain does not exist.' He understands the faculty of pain, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. He understands where the arisen faculty of pain ceases without remainder.  

Where does the arisen faculty of pain cease without remainder? Here, a bhikkhu, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first absorption, which includes directed thought, evaluation, and rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. There, the arisen faculty of pain ceases without remainder. This is called a bhikkhu who understands the cessation of the faculty of pain and directs his mind to Nibbāna.  

4. When a bhikkhu dwells diligently, ardently, and resolutely, and the faculty of distress arises in him, he understands: 'This faculty of distress has arisen in me. It has a condition...' He understands the faculty of distress, its origin, cessation, and path. He understands where it ceases without remainder.  

Where does it cease? Here, a bhikkhu, with the subsiding of directed thought and evaluation, enters and dwells in the second absorption, which has internal confidence, unification of mind, absence of directed thought and evaluation, and rapture and pleasure born of concentration. There, the arisen faculty of distress ceases without remainder. This is called a bhikkhu who understands the cessation of the faculty of distress and directs his mind to Nibbāna.  

5. When a bhikkhu dwells diligently... and the faculty of pleasure arises, he understands: 'This faculty of pleasure... ceases where?' Here, a bhikkhu, with the fading away of rapture, dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, experiencing pleasure with the body. He enters and dwells in the third absorption, of which the noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindful, and dwells happily.' There, the arisen faculty of pleasure ceases without remainder... directs his mind to Nibbāna.  

6. When a bhikkhu dwells diligently... and the faculty of joy arises, he understands: 'This faculty of joy... ceases where?' Here, a bhikkhu, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and the previous disappearance of joy and distress, enters and dwells in the fourth absorption, which is neither painful nor pleasant and purified by equanimity and mindfulness. There, the arisen faculty of joy ceases without remainder... directs his mind to Nibbāna.  

7. When a bhikkhu dwells diligently... and the faculty of equanimity arises, he understands: 'This faculty of equanimity... ceases where?' Here, a bhikkhu, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling. There, the arisen faculty of equanimity ceases without remainder. This is called a bhikkhu who understands the cessation of the faculty of equanimity and directs his mind to Nibbāna."
