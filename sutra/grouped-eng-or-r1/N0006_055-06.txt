6. The Section on Wisdom  

51. First: The Verses  
*2. "Monks, a noble disciple who possesses four things is a stream-enterer, freed from falling into the lower realms, bound for awakening. What are the four things?  
3. Here, monks, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha: ‘The Blessed One is an arhat, fully awakened, perfect in knowledge and conduct, the Well-Gone One, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One.’ They possess unwavering confidence in the Dhamma ... in the Sangha ... They possess virtue cherished by the noble ones—unbroken, untorn, unblemished, unmottled, liberating, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to samādhi.  
4. Monks, a noble disciple who possesses these four things is a stream-enterer, freed from falling into the lower realms, bound for awakening."  
The Blessed One spoke thus. After the Well-Gone One spoke, the Teacher further said:  
Faith in the Tathāgata, unshakable and well-established,  
Virtue praised by the noble ones, embraced with joy—  
Confidence in the Saṅgha and right view attained:  
They are said to possess the wealth of the Dhamma,  
Not poor, nor living in vain.  
Therefore, the wise, mindful of the Buddha’s teaching,  
Apply themselves diligently to faith, virtue,  
Confidence, and insight into the Dhamma.  

52. Second: The Rains Residence  
1. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.  
2. At that time, a monk who had completed the rains residence at Sāvatthī traveled to Kapilavatthu on business.  
3. The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard: "A monk who completed the rains residence at Sāvatthī has come here on business."  
4. The Sakyans approached that monk, paid respects, and sat to one side. They asked:  
5. "Venerable, is the Blessed One healthy and strong?" "He is." "Are Sāriputta and Moggallāna healthy?" "They are." "Is the Saṅgha healthy?" "It is."  
6. "Venerable, did you hear teachings directly from the Blessed One during the rains?"  
"The Blessed One said: ‘Monks, few are the monks who dwell having fully realized, here and now, the liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom through the destruction of the taints. More numerous are those who, through the destruction of the five lower fetters, are born spontaneously and attain final nibbāna there.  
7. Fewer still are those who become once-returners. More numerous are those who become stream-enterers, freed from falling into the lower realms, bound for awakening.’"  

53. Third: Dhammadinna  
1. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling at Isipatana in the Deer Park near Bārāṇasī.  
2. The lay follower Dhammadinna, with five hundred lay followers, approached the Blessed One. After paying respects, they sat and requested:  
3. "Blessed One, please teach us for our lasting welfare and happiness."  
"Dhammadinna, train thus: ‘The Dhamma taught by the Tathāgata is profound, of profound meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness. Dwell often immersed in it.’"  
4. "But, Blessed One, living amidst the distractions of family life, indulging in luxuries, how can we dwell thus? Teach us higher Dhamma appropriate for lay followers observing the five precepts."  
5. "Then, Dhammadinna, train thus: ‘Possess unwavering confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha, and possess virtue cherished by the noble ones.’"  
6. "Blessed One, these four factors of stream-entry are present in us. We abide in them."  
7. "Dhammadinna, fortunate are you! I declare you as stream-enterers."  

54. Fourth: Sickness  
1. Once, the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park.  
2. Many monks were preparing robes for the Blessed One to depart after three months.  
3. Mahānāma the Sakyan approached and asked: "Venerable, how should a wise lay follower afflicted by severe illness be advised?"  
4. "Mahānāma, reassure them with the four consolations: ‘Friend, have confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha, and possess virtue cherished by the noble ones.’  
5. Then ask: ‘Do you cling to parents, spouse, children, or the five sensual pleasures?’ If yes, urge them to abandon clinging.  
6. If they abandon clinging, urge them to resolve their mind toward higher heavens.  
7. Finally, direct them to relinquish even the Brahmā realm and aim for the cessation of identity.  
8. Mahānāma, such a mind-liberated lay follower is no different from a monk liberated for a hundred years."
