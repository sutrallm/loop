1. Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvelā, by the Nerañjarā River, at the foot of the Ajapāla banyan tree, having just attained full enlightenment.  
2. Then the Blessed One, seated in solitude, entered into meditation and reflected thus:  
3. "This Dhamma I have realized is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond mere reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. But this generation delights in attachment, revels in attachment, rejoices in attachment. For such beings, this truth—dependent origination and the cessation of all formations, the relinquishment of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna—is difficult to comprehend. If I were to teach this Dhamma, others would not understand me, and that would be wearisome and troublesome for me."  
4. Then this verse, never before heard, arose spontaneously in the Blessed One:  
"Enough with teaching what is hard to grasp—  
The Dhamma gained through striving, deep and subtle!  
Those bound by lust and hatred cannot understand,  
Blinded by ignorance, wrapped in darkness’ shroud."  
5. Thus reflecting, the Blessed One hesitated to teach the Dhamma.  
6. Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing the Blessed One’s thought through his mind, vanished from the Brahmā realm and appeared before the Blessed One as swiftly as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm.  
8. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and said:  
9. "Lord, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Well-Gone One teach! There are beings with little dust in their eyes who will fall away through not hearing the Dhamma. Let them become knowers of the Dhamma!"  
10. He further spoke this verse:  
"Arise, O Hero, Victor in battle,  
Leader of the caravan, free from debt,  
Wander the world! Let the Blessed One teach!  
Some will understand."  
11. The Blessed One, out of compassion, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha.  
12. He saw beings with varied defilements—some with much dust, some with little, some sharp, some dull, some with good qualities, some with bad, some easy to teach, some hard, and some who dwell perceiving the peril in faults for the next world.  
13. Like lotus ponds with lotuses—some submerged, some rising above, some blooming unsullied—so too the Blessed One saw beings.  
14. Then he replied to Brahmā Sahampati in verse:  
"Open for them the doors to the Deathless!  
Let those with ears now show their faith!  
Foreseeing weariness, O Brahmā,  
I did not speak the Dhamma subtle and sublime."  
15. Brahmā Sahampati, knowing the Blessed One’s consent, paid homage and vanished.  

2.  
1. Thus have I heard. At that time, the Blessed One dwelled at Uruvelā, by the Nerañjarā River, at the foot of the Ajapāla banyan tree, having attained enlightenment.  
2. Reflecting in solitude, he thought: "To live without showing reverence is unworthy. How shall I honor and dwell close to another ascetic or brahmin?"  
3. He realized: "To perfect the unfulfilled virtue, I should revere other ascetics. But in all realms, none equal me in virtue.  
4-7. Likewise for concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge of liberation—none surpass me.  
8. Thus, I shall dwell honoring the Dhamma I have realized."  
9. Brahmā Sahampati, reading his mind, appeared before him.  
10. He saluted the Blessed One and said:  
11. "So it was for past Buddhas, future Buddhas, and now for you—they all dwelled honoring the Dhamma."  
12. He added this verse:  
"Past and future Buddhas, and those now present,  
All honor the Dhamma that ends suffering.  
Thus, following the Buddhas’ path,  
One should revere the Dhamma."  

3.  
1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One dwelled at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove.  
2. A brahmin woman’s son, Brahmā, had gone forth under the Blessed One.  
3. Dwelling diligent, he soon achieved arahantship.  
4. One morning, he entered Sāvatthī for alms, approaching his mother’s house.  
5. His mother still made offerings to Brahmā.  
6. Brahmā Sahampati, wishing to admonish her, appeared in her home.  
7-9. In verse, he rebuked her ignorance, praised her son’s purity, and urged her to support him.  
10. He concluded:  
"Now you’ve crossed the flood, seeing the Sage.  
With steadfast faith, offering rightly,  
You’ll attain future bliss."  

4.  
1. The Blessed One addressed Baka Brahmā, who claimed his realm was eternal.  
2. The Buddha refuted him, explaining all conditioned things are impermanent.  
3-9. Baka boasted of his power, but the Buddha recounted his past deeds and revealed his limited understanding.  
10. Baka acknowledged the Buddha’s wisdom, marveling at his illumination of the Brahmā realm.  

5.  
1. A Brahmā held the false view: "No ascetic can reach here."  
2. The Buddha and his disciples manifested in the Brahmā realm, dazzling him.  
3-19. Through verses and dialogue, they humbled the Brahmā, showing the Buddha’s superior power and the many arahants among his followers.  

6.  
1. Two Brahmās urged a complacent Brahmā to honor the Buddha.  
2. When he boasted of his palace, they vanished, leaving him chastened.  

7.  
1. The Buddha remained silent as a Brahmā criticized a misguided monk.  
2. A verse condemned slanderous speech and its karmic fruit.  

8.  
1. A similar encounter occurred with another monk, reinforcing the lesson.  

9.  
1. A Brahmā warned the slanderer Kokālika of his impending hellish rebirth.  
2. The verse detailed the dire consequences of vilifying the noble ones.  

10.  
1. Kokālika, refusing to heed the Buddha’s warnings, died and fell into hell.  
2. Brahmā Sahampati confirmed his fate.  
3. The Buddha described the red-hot lotus hell’s immeasurable duration.  
4. The closing verse reinforced the folly of harmful speech.
