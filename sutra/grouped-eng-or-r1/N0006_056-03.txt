3. Koliya Village Chapter  

21. First Bhikkhu (1)  

1. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling in the land of the Bhikkhus, in Koliya Village.  

2. There, the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that you and I have wandered through such a long round of rebirths. What are the Four Noble Truths?  

3. Monks, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the Noble Truth of Suffering that you and I have wandered thus. Because of not understanding the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering... the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering... the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, we have wandered through such a long round.  

4. But now, monks, by understanding and penetrating the Noble Truth of Suffering, the Origin of Suffering, the Cessation of Suffering, and the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, craving for existence is cut off, the cord of existence is destroyed, and there is no more rebirth."  

5. When the Blessed One had spoken thus, the Well-Gone One further said:  
   Not having seen the Four Truths as they are,  
   Long have beings wandered through births.  
   But when these Truths are clearly seen,  
   The root of suffering is severed;  
   The cord of existence is cut—  
   There is now no more becoming.  

22. Second Bhikkhu (2)  

2. "Monks, if any ascetics or brahmins do not understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering,’ ‘This is the origin of suffering,’ ‘This is the cessation of suffering,’ ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,’ I do not acknowledge them as true ascetics or brahmins. Nor do those venerables realize the goal of asceticism or brahminhood in this very life, dwelling in its fulfillment.  

3. But monks, if ascetics or brahmins understand as it really is: ‘This is suffering,’ ‘This is the origin of suffering,’ ‘This is the cessation of suffering,’ ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering,’ I acknowledge them as true ascetics or brahmins. Those venerables realize the goal of asceticism or brahminhood in this very life, dwelling in its fulfillment."  

4. The Blessed One then added:  
   Those who do not comprehend suffering,  
   Nor its cause, its end, and the path,  
   Lack mind’s release and wisdom’s freedom;  
   They cannot reach suffering’s end.  
   But those who fully understand suffering,  
   Its cause, cessation, and the path,  
   Attain mind’s release and wisdom’s freedom—  
   Destroying birth and aging’s bonds.  

23. Third: The Fully Enlightened One  

1–2. At Savatthi.  

3. "Monks, there are Four Noble Truths: the Noble Truth of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, and the Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

4. Monks, because the Tathagata has fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths as they are, he is called the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One.  

5. Therefore, monks, strive diligently: ‘This is suffering,’ ‘This is its origin,’ ‘This is its cessation,’ ‘This is the path leading to its cessation.’"  

24. Fourth: The Arahant  

1. At Savatthi.  

2–4. "Monks, all past, future, and present Arahants, Perfectly Enlightened Ones, have awakened to the Four Noble Truths as they are.  

5. These are: the Noble Truth of Suffering, the Origin of Suffering, the Cessation of Suffering, and the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering.  

6–7. Therefore, monks, strive diligently: ‘This is suffering,’ ‘This is its origin,’ ‘This is its cessation,’ ‘This is the path.’"  

25. Fifth: The Destruction of Defilements  

2–3. "Monks, I teach the destruction of defilements for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not. What is destroyed? By knowing ‘This is suffering’... ‘This is the origin’... ‘This is the cessation’... ‘This is the path,’ defilements are destroyed.  

4. Therefore, monks, strive diligently!"  

26. Sixth: Friends  

2–4. "Monks, if you have friends, relatives, or kin worthy of compassion, urge them to cultivate the Four Noble Truths.  

5. Therefore, strive diligently!"  

27. Seventh: As It Is  

2–4. "Monks, the Four Noble Truths are authentic, unerring, and unchanging. Hence they are called Noble Truths.  

5. Therefore, strive diligently!"  

28. Eighth: The World  

2–4. "Monks, the Four Noble Truths are supreme among gods, Mara, Brahma, ascetics, brahmins, and humanity. Hence they are called Noble Truths.  

5. Therefore, strive diligently!"  

29. Ninth: To Be Fully Understood  

2–5. "Monks, among the Four Noble Truths, one is to be fully understood (suffering), one is to be abandoned (origin), one is to be realized (cessation), and one is to be cultivated (the path).  

6. Therefore, strive diligently!"  

30. Tenth: Gavampati  

1. At one time, several elder monks were dwelling in the Cetiya country at Sahajati.  

2. After the meal, they discussed: "Friends, does one who sees suffering also see its origin, cessation, and path?"  

3. Venerable Gavampati replied: "Friends, I heard this from the Blessed One:  

4. ‘Monks, one who sees suffering also sees its origin, cessation, and path. So too, seeing the origin, cessation, or path, one sees all Four Truths.’"
