Thus I have heard: At one time, the Buddha was in the Jeta Grove of the Anathapindika's Park in the city of Shravasti, together with a great assembly of monks, twelve hundred and fifty in number. At that time, when it was time for the meal, the World-Honored One donned his robes, took his bowl, and entered the great city of Shravasti to beg for food. He begged sequentially throughout the city, and after having done so, he returned to his original place. After finishing his meal, he put away his robe and bowl, washed his feet, and then sat down on the prepared seat.

At that time, the elder Subhuti was among the assembly. He rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and with palms pressed together in respect, addressed the Buddha, saying: 'How rare, O World Honored One! The Tathagata cherishes and carefully attends to the Bodhisattvas, and entrusts them with profound teachings. World Honored One, when good men and good women set forth the supreme aspiration for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi (the highest perfect Enlightenment), how should they dwell? How should they subdue their minds?' The Buddha replied: 'Excellent, excellent, Subhuti! As you have said, the Tathagata cherishes and carefully attends to the Bodhisattvas and entrusts them with profound teachings. Listen carefully now, and I will tell you. Good men and good women who set forth the aspiration for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi should abide thus, and subdue their minds thus.' 'Indeed, World Honored One, I joyfully wish to hear.
The Buddha said to Subhuti: 'All Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas, should subdue their minds as follows: All categories of beings—whether born from eggs, from wombs, from moisture, or by transformation; whether they have form or are formless; whether they have thought or are without thought; even those neither with nor without thought—I will lead them all into Nirvana without any remainder, to extinguish them. Thus, although countless immeasurable, infinite beings are extinguished, there are really no beings that are extinguished. Why is this? Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva holds onto the notions of a self, a person, a being, or a lifespan, they are not a Bodhisattva.'

Furthermore, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should practice generosity without abiding in any phenomena. That is, they should practice giving without attachment to form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or mental objects. Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should give in such a manner, not abiding in appearances. Why? Because when a Bodhisattva practices generosity without abiding in appearances, their merit is inconceivable. Subhuti, what do you think? Can the emptiness of the eastern direction be measured? 'No, World-Honored One.' Subhuti, can the emptiness of the south, west, north, the intermediate directions, above, and below be measured? 'No, World-Honored One.' Subhuti, similarly, the merit of a Bodhisattva who gives without abiding in appearances is also inconceivable. Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should reside only as taught!

Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Tathagata be seen by physical form? No, World Honored One! The Tathagata cannot be seen by physical form. Why? Because the physical form spoken of by the Tathagata is not a true physical form." The Buddha said to Subhuti, "All forms are illusory. If you see that all forms are not forms, you see the Tathagata."
Subhuti asked the Buddha: 'World-Honored One! Are there any sentient beings who, upon hearing such words and sentences, will have true faith?' The Buddha told Subhuti: 'Do not say so! Five hundred years after the Tathagata's passing, there will be those who observe the precepts and cultivate merits. Upon hearing these words and sentences, they will develop faith and regard them as true. You should know that these people have not planted good roots with just one Buddha, two Buddhas, or three, four, five Buddhas, but have already planted good roots with countless Buddhas. Upon hearing these words and sentences, even for a moment, those who generate pure faith, Subhuti, the Tathagata fully knows and sees these sentient beings will attain such immeasurable merits. Why? Because these sentient beings will no longer retain notions of self, notions of a person, notions of a sentient being, notions of a life span, neither phenomena nor non-phenomena. Why? If these sentient beings cling to any phenomena, it amounts to clinging to the notion of self, person, sentient being, and life span. If they cling to non-phenomena, it is also clinging to the notion of self, person, sentient being, and life span. Therefore, one should not grasp onto phenomena, nor should one grasp onto non-phenomena. For this reason, the Tathagata always says: 'O monks! Understand that my teachings are like a raft.' Even the dharma should be let go of, how much more so non-dharma?
Subhuti, what do you think? Has the Tathagata attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi? Does the Tathagata have a teaching to expound?" Subhuti replied, "As I understand the meaning of the Buddha’s teachings, there is no fixed dharma called Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, nor is there any fixed dharma that the Tathagata can expound. Why? Because the dharmas expounded by the Tathagata are not to be clung to or expressed; they are neither dharmas nor non-dharmas. Why is this so? Because all sages and saints differ due to the dharma of non-action."
'Subhuti, what do you think? If a person fills three thousand great thousand worlds with the seven treasures and uses them for almsgiving, would the merit gained by this person be great or not?' Subhuti replied, 'Very great, World Honored One! Why? Because this merit is not the nature of merit, therefore the Tathagata says the merit is great.'
'Furthermore, if there is a person who receives, upholds, and even recites as little as four lines of verse from this sutra and explains it to others, his merit will surpass the former. Why? Subhuti, all the Buddhas and the Dharma of the Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi of all Buddhas arise from this sutra. Subhuti, what is called the Buddha-dharma is not the Buddha-dharma.
 
Subhuti, what do you think? Can a stream-enterer consider, 'I have attained the fruit of stream-entry'? Subhuti said: 'No, World-Honored One! And why? Because 'stream-enterer' refers to one who enters the stream, yet there is nothing to enter; not entering forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, or dharmas. This is called a stream-enterer.'
Subhuti, what do you think? Can a once-returner think, 'I have attained the fruit of a once-returner'? Subhuti said: 'No, World-Honored One! And why? Because 'once-returner' implies going and coming back, but in reality, there is no going or coming back. That is why it is called a once-returner.'
Subhuti, what do you think? Can a non-returner think, 'I have attained the fruit of a non-returner'? Subhuti said: 'No, World-Honored One! And why? Because 'non-returner' means not coming back, yet in reality, there is no not coming back. Therefore, it is called a non-returner.'
Subhuti, what do you think? Can an arhat think, 'I have attained the arhat path'? Subhuti said: 'No, World-Honored One! And why? Because there is no such dharma as an arhat. World-Honored One, if an arhat thinks, 'I have attained the arhat path,' he clings to the notion of self, person, being, and lifespan. World-Honored One, the Buddha said that I have attained the Samadhi of non-contention, which is foremost among humans, the foremost of those free from desire. World-Honored One, I do not think, 'I am an arhat free from desire.' World-Honored One, if I thought, 'I have attained the arhat path,' then you would not say that Subhuti delights in practicing alms-giving. Since Subhuti truly has no practice, yet is named Subhuti, this is called delighting in the practice of alms-giving.
 
The Buddha said to Subhuti, "What do you think? When the Tathagata was in the presence of Dipankara Buddha, did he attain anything from the Dharma?" "No, World Honored One! When the Tathagata was with Dipankara Buddha, he truly attained nothing from the Dharma." "Subhuti, what do you think? Do Bodhisattvas adorn Buddha lands?" "No, World Honored One! Why? Because adorning Buddha lands is not really adorning; it is called adorning." "Therefore, Subhuti, all Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas, should cultivate a pure mind and should not fixate their minds on forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, or dharmas. They should cultivate a mind that does not fixate on anything. Subhuti, suppose a person's body was as large as Mount Sumeru, what do you think? Would that body be considered large?" Subhuti replied, "Very large, World Honored One! Why? Because the Buddha teaches that the body is not a body, and it is called a great body."
 
Subhuti, consider this: if there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the Ganges river, what do you think? Would those grains of sand be many?" Subhuti replied, "Very many, World Honored One! The rivers alone are countless, not to mention the sands."
Subhuti, I now truthfully tell you, if there were a good man or a good woman who filled as many worlds as there are grains of sand in those Ganges rivers with the seven treasures and gave them away in alms, would their merit be great?" Subhuti replied, "Very great, World Honored One."
The Buddha told Subhuti, "If a good man or a good woman holds to and recites even a four-line verse of this sutra and explains it to others, their merit will surpass that of giving away the seven treasures as previously described.
 
Furthermore: 'Subhuti! Wherever this sutra is expounded, even down to a four-line gatha, know that at such places, all beings in the worlds, including gods, humans, and asuras, should offer their reverence as if to a stupa or temple. How much more so for a person who can fully embrace, read, and recite it. Subhuti! Know that such a person will achieve the supreme and rarest Dharma. Wherever this scripture is, there is the Buddha, or his revered disciples.'
 
At that time, Subhuti addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One! What should this scripture be named? How should we uphold it?" The Buddha told Subhuti: "This scripture is named the Vajra Prajnaparamita. You should uphold it by this name. Why is that? Subhuti! The Buddha speaks of Prajnaparamita, yet it is not Prajnaparamita; it is called Prajnaparamita. Subhuti! What do you think? Does the Tathagata have a Dharma to speak of?" Subhuti said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! The Tathagata has nothing to speak of."
"Subhuti! What do you think? Are the particles of dust in the three thousand great thousand worlds numerous?" Subhuti replied: "Very numerous, World-Honored One!" "Subhuti, the Tathagata says that particles are not particles; they are called particles. The Tathagata says that worlds are not worlds; they are called worlds. Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Tathagata be seen through his thirty-two marks?" "No, World-Honored One! One cannot see the Tathagata through the thirty-two marks. Why is that? The Tathagata says that the thirty-two marks are not marks; they are called the thirty-two marks."
"Subhuti! If there is a good man or a good woman who sacrifices their body and life as many times as there are sands in the Ganges, and if someone else upholds even a four-line verse of this scripture and expounds it to others, their merit will be exceedingly great!"
 
At that time, Subhuti, upon hearing this sutra, deeply understood its meaning and was moved to tears. He then said to the Buddha: “How rare, World-Honored One! Such a profound sutra as this I have never heard before in all my past experience. World-Honored One, if there are those who hear this sutra, whose faith is pure, they will perceive the true nature of reality. Know that such persons have achieved the highest and rarest merit. World-Honored One, this true nature of reality is, in fact, no nature; hence the Tathagata speaks of it as the true nature. World-Honored One, now that I have heard this sutra, to believe, understand, and uphold it is not difficult for me. But in the future, five hundred years from now, if there are beings who hear this sutra and believe, understand, and uphold it, they will be most rare. Why is this? Because they are free from the notions of self, person, being, and lifespan. Why? Because any notion of self or being, person, or lifespan is, in fact, no notion. Why is this so? Because apart from all notions lies the name of all Buddhas.”
The Buddha said to Subhuti: “Exactly so, exactly so! If there are those who can hear this teaching without alarm, without fear, without dread, know that they are most rare. Why? Subhuti, what the Tathagata calls the supreme perfection is not the supreme perfection; hence it is known as the supreme perfection. Subhuti, the perfection of patience that the Tathagata speaks of is not the perfection of patience; hence it is called the perfection of patience. Why? Subhuti, when I was dismembered by King Kali in a previous life, I was without notions of self, person, being, and lifespan. Why? If I had held onto these notions at that time, I would have harbored hatred and anger. Subhuti, remember also that in the past five hundred lifetimes as a hermit enduring insults, I was without notions of self, person, being, and lifespan. Therefore, Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should detach from all appearances and arouse the mind towards Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi without abiding in forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, or dharmas. The mind should abide nowhere. If the mind abides somewhere, it is in error. Therefore, the Buddha says that the Bodhisattva’s mind should not abide in forms when practicing generosity. Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should practice generosity for the benefit of all beings in this way. The Tathagata declares that all appearances are not appearances, and all beings are not beings. Subhuti, the Tathagata is the speaker of truth, the speaker of reality, the speaker of consistency, the speaker without deception, the speaker without discrepancy. Subhuti, the Dharma obtained by the Tathagata is neither real nor unreal. Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva’s mind abides in dharmas while practicing generosity, it is like a person walking in darkness, seeing nothing. But if a Bodhisattva’s mind does not abide in dharmas while practicing generosity, it is like a person with eyes walking in bright sunlight, seeing all colors distinctly. Subhuti, in the future, if there are good men and women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra, they will be recognized by the Tathagata with the wisdom of the Buddha, and they will achieve immeasurable, limitless merit.”
 
Subhuti, imagine if a good man or a good woman, on the first day, gave away as many bodies as there are grains of sand in the Ganges; and then did the same on the second day, and continued on the third day, and kept doing so for countless hundreds of thousands of millions of eons, giving away bodies. Yet if there is another person who hears this Sutra and has unshakable faith, his or her merit will surpass the former. How much more so for those who write it down, hold to it, recite it, and explain it to others. Subhuti, to sum it up: this Sutra has immeasurable, inconceivable, and limitless merit. The Tathagata has spoken it for those who embark on the greatest vehicle, the supreme vehicle. If there are people who can accept, recite, and spread it extensively, the Tathagata will fully know and see these people, and they will achieve immeasurable, indescribable, infinite, and inconceivable merit. Such persons are truly bearing the burden of the Tathagata's Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Why? Subhuti, those who delight in lesser teachings are attached to the view of a self, a person, a living being, and a lifespan; they cannot listen, recite, or explain this Sutra. Subhuti, wherever this Sutra is found, all the worlds of gods, men, and asuras should make offerings, recognizing that place as a stupa. All should revere, circulate around it, and scatter flowers and incense around it.
Furthermore, Subhuti, if good men or good women receive, uphold, and recite this sutra, and if they are despised by others, it means that these individuals have committed sins in their past lives which would have led them to fall into evil paths. Because they are despised in this life, their past sins are thereby eradicated, and they will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Subhuti, I recall that in the distant past, immeasurable asamkhyeya kalpas ago, in the presence of the Buddha Dipankara and other numerous Buddhas, I served and made offerings to all of them without exception. Moreover, if there is anyone who, in the degenerate age, can receive, uphold, and recite this sutra, the merit they acquire will be incomparably greater than the merit I gained from making offerings to those Buddhas—infinitely greater, beyond what can be calculated, described, or conceptualized. Subhuti, if good men and good women in the degenerate age receive and recite this sutra, and I were to fully describe the merit they obtain, those who hear about it would go mad with disbelief and skepticism. Subhuti, you should know that the meaning of this sutra is beyond comprehension, as is its retributive effect.
 
At that time, Subhuti addressed the Buddha, saying: "World Honored One, how should a good man or a good woman, who has set forth the aspiration for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi (Supreme Perfect Enlightenment), abide and how should they subdue their mind?" The Buddha replied to Subhuti: "A good man or a good woman who has developed the mind towards Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi should cultivate this thought: 'I should lead all sentient beings to Nirvana.' But after leading all sentient beings to Nirvana, not a single sentient being has actually been led to Nirvana. Why is this so? Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva holds onto the notions of a self, a person, a being, or a lifespan, then they are not a Bodhisattva. Why? Subhuti, there is actually no dharma (phenomenon or law) called Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Subhuti, what do you think? Did the Tathagata obtain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi from Dipankara Buddha?" Subhuti replied, "No, World Honored One. As I understand the meaning of the Buddha's teachings, the Tathagata did not obtain anything called Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi from Dipankara Buddha." The Buddha said, "Exactly so, Subhuti! There is truly no dharma by which the Tathagata attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Subhuti, if there were such a dharma, Dipankara Buddha would not have prophesied about me, saying, 'In a future life, you will become a Buddha named Shakyamuni.' It is because there is truly no dharma called Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi that Dipankara Buddha made such a prophecy about me. Why? Because 'Tathagata' implies thusness of all dharmas. If someone says that the Tathagata attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, Subhuti, there is truly no dharma by which the Buddha attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Subhuti, what the Tathagata has attained in Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi involves neither truth nor falsehood. Therefore, the Tathagata declares that all dharmas are Buddha-dharmas. Subhuti, when it is said that all dharmas are thus, it actually means they are not, thus they are called all dharmas. Subhuti, just like a person of great stature is called 'great,' yet in truth, they are not great, which is why they are called 'great.' Subhuti, it is similar for a Bodhisattva; if they say, 'I will liberate innumerable sentient beings,' then they are not called a Bodhisattva. Why? Because, Subhuti, there truly is no dharma called 'Bodhisattva.' Thus, the Buddha teaches that all dharmas are devoid of self, person, being, and lifespan. Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva declares, 'I will adorn the Buddha-lands,' they are not called a Bodhisattva. Why? As the Tathagata has said, adorning the Buddha-lands is not really adorning; thus, it is called adorning. Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva perfectly understands the dharma of non-self, the Tathagata declares them to be a true Bodhisattva."
 
"Subhuti, what do you think? Does the Tathagata possess the physical eye?" "Yes, World-Honored One, the Tathagata possesses the physical eye." "Subhuti, what do you think? Does the Tathagata possess the divine eye?" "Yes, World-Honored One, the Tathagata possesses the divine eye." "Subhuti, what do you think? Does the Tathagata possess the wisdom eye?" "Yes, World-Honored One, the Tathagata possesses the wisdom eye." "Subhuti, what do you think? Does the Tathagata possess the Dharma eye?" "Yes, World-Honored One, the Tathagata possesses the Dharma eye." "Subhuti, what do you think? Does the Tathagata possess the Buddha eye?" "Yes, World-Honored One, the Tathagata possesses the Buddha eye." "Subhuti, what do you think? As the Ganges River contains sands, does the Buddha declare those as sands?" "Yes, World-Honored One, the Tathagata declares those as sands." "Subhuti, what do you think? If there were as many Ganges Rivers as there are sands in one Ganges River, would the sands of all those Ganges Rivers be numerous?" "Very numerous, World-Honored One!" The Buddha told Subhuti: "In your homeland, the Tathagata fully knows all the various types of minds of all beings. Why? Because the Tathagata declares all minds to be non-minds, and this is called a mind. Why is this so? Subhuti, the mind of the past cannot be grasped, the mind of the present cannot be grasped, and the mind of the future cannot be grasped."
 
"Subhuti, what do you think? If someone filled the three thousand great thousand worlds with the seven treasures and used them for giving, would this person, because of this cause and condition, obtain much merit?" "Yes, World Honored One! This person, because of this cause and condition, would obtain very much merit." "Subhuti, if merit were something substantial, the Tathagata would not say that much merit is obtained. Because merit is insubstantial, the Tathagata says that much merit is obtained."
 
Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Buddha be seen by means of a fully endowed physical form?" "No, World Honored One. The Tathagata should not be seen as possessing a fully endowed physical form. Why is this? Because when the Tathagata speaks of a fully endowed physical form, it is not really a fully endowed physical form. That is what is meant by a fully endowed physical form."
"Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Tathagata be seen by means of fully endowed attributes?" "No, World Honored One. The Tathagata should not be seen as possessing fully endowed attributes. Why is this? Because when the Tathagata speaks of fully endowed attributes, they are not really fully endowed attributes. That is what is meant by fully endowed attributes."
 
Subhuti, do not think that the Tathagata thinks, 'I should preach some Dharma.' Do not entertain such thoughts. Why? If someone says the Tathagata preaches some Dharma, they are slandering the Buddha because they do not understand what I have taught. Subhuti, the one who speaks the Dharma, speaks of no Dharma to be spoken; this is called speaking the Dharma." At that time, wise Subhuti said to the Buddha: "World Honored One, will there be beings in future ages who, hearing this Dharma, will believe in their hearts?" The Buddha said, "Subhuti, they are neither beings nor non-beings. Why? Subhuti, the Tathagata says that beings, called beings, are not beings; this is why they are called beings."
 
 
Subhuti asked the Buddha, "World Honored One! Has the Buddha attained the supreme enlightenment of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, or is there nothing attained?" The Buddha replied, "Just so, Subhuti, just so. Regarding Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, there is not even the slightest dharma that has been attained. That is called Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
 
Furthermore, "Subhuti! This Dharma is equal, without high or low, which is named Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. By practicing all good Dharmas without self, without person, without sentient beings, and without life, one attains Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Subhuti! The so-called good Dharmas, as the Tathagata says, are not good Dharmas; that is named good Dharmas."
 
"Subhuti! If in the three thousand great thousand worlds, all the Sumeru Mountains, filled with the seven treasures, are given in charity, the merit obtained from such an act would not equal one hundredth, one thousandth, one ten-thousandth part – it cannot even be compared to someone who accepts, upholds, reads, recites, and explains this Prajnaparamita Sutra to others, even if only a four-line gatha, as the merit from the former is not calculable through analogy or numerical estimation."
 
"Subhuti, what do you think? Do not say that the Tathagata thinks, 'I should save sentient beings.' Subhuti, do not think such a thought! Why? There actually are no sentient beings for the Tathagata to save. If there were sentient beings for the Tathagata to save, it would imply that the Tathagata has the notions of self, person, sentient beings, and lifespan. Subhuti, when the Tathagata speaks of having a self, he does not really have a self, though ordinary people think he does. Subhuti, what ordinary people refer to, the Tathagata says is not ordinary; this is called being ordinary."
"Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Tathagata be seen by means of his thirty-two physical characteristics?" Subhuti said, "Yes, indeed, the Tathagata can be observed through these characteristics." The Buddha said, "Subhuti, if the Tathagata could be seen by his thirty-two characteristics, then a Chakravartin (universal monarch) would be the Tathagata." Subhuti said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, according to my understanding of the Buddha's teachings, one should not view the Tathagata through his thirty-two characteristics." At that time, the World-Honored One spoke this verse: "If one seeks me in form, if one seeks me in sound, Such a person practices a wrongful path, They cannot see the Tathagata."
 
"Subhuti, if you think, 'The Tathagata has not attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi because he manifests no characteristics,' do not think that way. Subhuti, if you conceive such a thought, those who aspire to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi claim that all phenomena cease to exist. Do not think in that way! Why? Because those who aspire to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi do not claim that phenomena cease to exist."
 
"Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva were to fill worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges with the seven treasures for alms-giving, and someone else realized that all dharmas are without a self and thereby attained forbearance, this Bodhisattva's merit would surpass the former. Why? Subhuti, because Bodhisattvas do not receive blessings." Subhuti asked the Buddha, "World-Honored One, how do Bodhisattvas not receive blessings?" "Subhuti, the merits Bodhisattvas perform, they should not cling to them; therefore, it is said they do not receive blessings."
 
"Subhuti, if someone says, 'The Tathagata comes or goes, sits or lies down,' they do not understand what I have taught. Why? Because 'Tathagata' implies neither coming nor going; thus, he is called the Tathagata."
 
"Subhuti, if a good man or a good woman pulverized three thousand great thousand worlds into fine dust, what do you think? Would that amount of dust be considerable?" Subhuti replied, "Very considerable, World Honored One! Why? If that dust really existed, the Buddha would not say it is dust. Why is this? The Buddha speaks of dust as not being dust, and thus it is called dust. World Honored One, what the Tathagata says about the three thousand great thousand worlds is also thus—they are not worlds, and thus they are called worlds. Why? If a world really existed, it would be the aspect of a single whole; the Tathagata speaks of the aspect of a single whole as not being the aspect of a single whole, and thus it is called the aspect of a single whole." Subhuti, the aspect of a single whole is unspeakable; only ordinary people cling to it."
 
"Subhuti, if someone says, 'The Buddha speaks of a self, a person, a being, a lifespan,' what do you think? Does this person understand what I have said?" Subhuti replied, "No, World Honored One. This person does not understand the Tathagata's teaching. Why? Because when the World Honored One speaks of a self, a person, a being, a lifespan, it is not a self, a person, a being, a lifespan, thus they are called a self, a person, a being, a lifespan." Subhuti! Those who aspire to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi should thus know, see, and believe in all things without becoming attached to the appearance of things. Subhuti, the Tathagata says that what is called 'appearance of things' is not the appearance of things, and thus it is called the appearance of things."
 
"Subhuti, if someone filled innumerable asankhyeya worlds with the seven treasures for almsgiving, and if a good man or a good woman aspired to bodhicitta and upheld this sutra, even if only to the extent of four lines of a verse, and expounded it to others, their merit would surpass the former. How should they expound it to others? Without becoming attached to forms, immovably so. Why? All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows; like dew and also like lightning, and should be viewed as such."
 
After the Buddha spoke this sutra, the elder Subhuti, along with the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, and all the gods, humans, and asuras of the world, upon hearing what the Buddha had said, were greatly joyful and faithfully accepted and practiced it.
